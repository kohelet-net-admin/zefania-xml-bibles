    <description>The Bible in Worldwide English (BWE)\par This New Testament was originally prepared by Annie Cressman, who died in 1993. She was a Canadian Bible teacher in Liberia in West Africa. Whilst teaching students in a Bible School where the language used was English, she found that she was spending more time explaining the meaning of the English than she was teaching the Bible itself. So she decided to write this simple version in easy English so that her students could easily understand.\par\par In 1959 the Full Gospel Publishing House in Toronto, Canada, printed a trial edition of the Gospel of Mark. A further edition was published in 1962 by the American Bible Society. The whole New Testament was first published by SOON Publications in India in 1969 in hardback form. This was assisted by Operation Mobilisation (OM) and was reprinted in 1971.\par\par The vision to reprint a new edition of the whole New Testament has now been carried out by SOON in conjunction with EPH and OM. Where a change to more modern words has been made, this has been kept in line with the the Authorised Version.</description>

  <BIBLEBOOK bnumber="40" bname="Matthäus" bsname="Mt">
    <CHAPTER cnumber="1">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Here are the names of the people in the family line from which Jesus Christ came. He came from Davids family. He came from Abrahams family.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Jesus family line: Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Judah, Perez (his mother was Tamar), Zezron,  Ram, Amminadab, Nahshon, Salmon, Boaz (his mother was Rahab), Obed (his mother was Ruth), Jesse, David the king, Solomon (whose mother was Uriahs wife), Rehoboam,  Abijah, Asa, Jehoshaphat, Joram, Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, Hezekiah, Manasseh, Amon,  Josiah, Jeconiah and his brothers (at the time the people of Israel were carried away to Babylon), Shealtiel, Zerubbabel, Abiud, Eliakim, Azor, Zadok, Achim, Eliud, Eleazor,  Matthan, Jacob and Joseph who was the husband of Mary. Mary was the mother of Jesus, who is called the Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">There were fourteen families from Abraham to David. There were fourteen families from David to the time the people were taken to Babylon. And there were fourteen families after that until Christ was born.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">This is the way Jesus Christ was born. Mary, his mother, was promised to Joseph to be his wife. But before they were married, she found out that she was going to have a baby.  It was by the Holy Spirit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Joseph, the man she was to marry, was a good man. He did not want her to be made ashamed. So he planned to leave her without telling people about it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">While he was thinking about this, he had a dream. An angel of the Lord came to him. He said, Joseph, Davids son, do not fear to take Mary to be your wife. Her baby is by the Holy Spirit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">She will have a baby son. Name him Jesus, because he will save his people from the wrong things they have done.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">All of this had been told long before by the Lord through his prophet. It came true.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">The prophet said, A young woman who has not slept with a man is going to have a baby son. His name will be Emmanuel. That means "God is with us."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Joseph woke up and did what the angel of the Lord told him to do. He took Mary to be his wife.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">But he did not make love with her until her first son had been born. He named him Jesus.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="2">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Jesus was born in the town of Bethlehem, in the country of Judea. Herod was the king.  After Jesus was born, wise men came from the east to Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">They asked, Where is the child who has been born to be King of the Jews? We saw his star rising and we have come to worship him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">When King Herod heard this, he was very troubled. All the people in Jerusalem were troubled also.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">He called all the chief priests and the scribes of the Jews for a meeting. He asked them,  Where is the Christ to be born?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">They told him, In Bethlehem in Judea. That is what the prophet, the man of God long ago, wrote:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">"Bethlehem in the country of Judah, you are not the least among the leaders in Judah. A leader will come from you who will rule over my people Israel."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Then Herod called the wise men to talk with them secretly. He found out from them what time they saw the star.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">He sent them to Bethlehem. He said, Go and ask everywhere until you find the child.  When you have found him, come and tell me, so that I myself may go and worship him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">After they heard what the king said, they went away. And the star, which they had seen rising, went in front of them. It stopped above the place where the child was.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">When they saw the star, they were very glad.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">They went into the house, and there they saw the child and Mary his mother. They kneeled down and worshipped him. Then they opened their bags and gave him gifts.  These gifts were gold, and frankincense and myrrh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">In a dream they were told not to go back to Herod. So they went home by a different road.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">After the wise men had gone, Joseph had a dream. An angel of the Lord came to him and said, Get up. Take the child and his mother, and go quickly to the country of Egypt. Stay there till I tell you, because Herod will try to find the child and kill him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Joseph woke up. He took the child and his mother in the night and went to Egypt.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">He stayed there until Herod died. What the Lord told through his prophet long ago, came true. He said I called my son out of Egypt.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Herod saw that the wise men had fooled him. He was very angry. He sent men to kill all the baby boys in the town of Bethlehem and around it. They killed all the boys who were two years old or less. Herod remembered what the wise men had told him about the time they first saw the star.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">So what the prophet Jeremiah said, came true.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">He said, A voice could be heard in the town of Ramah. Rachel was crying for her children. She would not let anyone comfort her because her children were dead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Herod died. Then Joseph had a dream. An angel of the Lord came to him in Egypt.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">The angel said, Get up. Take the child and his mother and go to the country of Israel.  The men who wanted to kill the child are dead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Joseph woke up. He took the child and his mother and went to the country of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">But he heard that Archelaus was king of Judea in his father Herods place. So he was afraid to go there. In a dream he was told what to do. He went to the country of Galilee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">He went and made his home in the town of Nazareth. The prophets of God long ago had said, He shall be called a man from Nazareth. What they said came true.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="3">
      <VERS vnumber="1">After some years had passed, John the Baptizer came and told Gods word in the desert of Judea.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">He said, Stop doing wrong things and turn back to God! The kingdom of heaven is almost here.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">This is the man that Isaiah the prophet of God spoke about long ago. He said, A man is calling in the wilderness, "Make the way ready for the Lord. Make the road straight for him."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">John wore clothes made of camels hair and a leather belt. He ate locusts and wild honey.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">People went to him from Jerusalem, from all of Judea, and from all the country near the Jordan River.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">He baptised them in the Jordan River when they said how sorry they were for the wrong things they had done.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Many of the Pharisee group and the Sadducee group came to him to be baptised. But when he saw them, he said to them, You family of snakes! Who told you to run away from Gods anger that is coming?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Stop your wrong ways to show that you have turned back to God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Do not think you can say to your-selves, "Abraham is our father." I tell you, God can make children for Abraham from these stones.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">The axe is ready to cut down the trees. Every tree that does not have good fruit is cut down and thrown into a fire.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">I baptise you with water when you stop your wrong ways. But another person is coming after me. He is greater than I am. I am not good enough to take off his shoes. He will baptise you with the Holy Spirit and with fire.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">He has a cleaning fan in his hand and will fan his grain very clean. He will put the grain into his storehouse. But he will burn the chaff in the fire that never dies.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Then Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan River. He came to John to be baptised by him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">John tried to stop him. He said, I need to be baptised by you. Why do you come to me to be baptised?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">But Jesus answered, Please do it now. In this way we shall do all that is right. Then John let him be baptised.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">After Jesus was baptised, he came up out of the water right away. The sky opened. He saw the Spirit of God coming down on him like a dove.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">A voice from the sky said, This is my dear Son. I am very pleased with him.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="4">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Then the Spirit led Jesus into the desert. The devil tried to make Jesus do wrong.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Jesus did not eat anything for forty days and forty nights. Then he was very hungry.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">The one who tries to make people do wrong came and said to him, If you are Gods Son,  tell these stones to be changed into bread.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">But Jesus answered him, The holy writings say, "Man cannot live on bread only. He needs to live by every word that God says."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Then the devil took Jesus to the holy city. He put him on a high part of the temple.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">The devil said to him, If you are Gods Son, jump down. The holy writings say, "God will tell his angels to take care of you. They will hold you up in their hands so that you will not knock your foot on a stone."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Jesus answered him, The holy writings say, "You must not test the Lord your God."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">The devil took Jesus to a very high hill. He showed him all the countries of the world and how great they were.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">He said to Jesus, I will give you all these if you kneel down and worship me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">But Jesus answered him, Get away, Satan. The holy writings say, "You must worship the Lord your God. and he is the only one you are to worship."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Then the devil left Jesus. Angels came and took care of him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Jesus heard that John was put in prison, so he went to Galilee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">He left the town of Nazareth and went to live in the town of Capernaum. It is by the sea (of Galilee) in the district of Zebulun and Naphtali.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">So what the prophet Isaiah said came true.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">He talked about, The country of Zebulun and the country of Naphtali, the road by the sea, the land on the other side of the Jordan River, Galilee where the people are not Jews.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And he said, The people who lived in darkness have seen a great Light. Light has come to those who lived in a land covered by the dark shadow of death.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">From then on, Jesus began to tell Gods word to the people. He said, Stop your wrong ways and turn back to God! The kingdom of heaven is here!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Jesus was walking by the sea of Galilee. There he saw two brothers, Simon who later was named Peter, and his brother Andrew. They were throwing a fishing net into the water. Their work was to catch fish.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Jesus said to them, Come with me. The work I will give you will be to catch people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Right away they left their nets and went with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Jesus went on from there and saw two other brothers, James and John. Their fathers name was Zebedee. They were in the boat with their father mending their nets.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Jesus called them. Right away they left the boat and their father and went with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Jesus went all around through Galilee. He taught people in their meeting houses and told them the good news about the kingdom of heaven. He healed all the sick and weak people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">The people in all the country of Syria heard about him. They brought all who were sick in any way, or had bad spirits in them, and those who could not walk or use their hands.  Jesus healed them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Many people went with him. They came from Galilee, the Ten Towns, Jerusalem, Judea,  and from the other side of the Jordan river.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="5">
      <VERS vnumber="1">When Jesus saw the many people, he went up on a hill. He sat down and his disciples came to him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">He began to teach the people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">He said, God makes happy those who know that they need him. The kingdom of heaven is for them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">God makes happy those who are sad. They will have comfort.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">God makes happy those who quietly trust him and do not try to get their own way. The world will belong to them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">God makes happy those who are hungry and thirsty for what is right and good. They will be filled.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">God makes happy those who are kind. He will be kind to them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">God makes happy those who have clean hearts. They will see God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">God makes happy those who make peace between people. They will be called Gods sons.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">God makes happy those who have trouble for doing what is right. The kingdom of heaven is for them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">God makes you happy when people say wrong things about you, when they trouble you,  and when they say all kinds of lies about you. God makes you happy when it is for my sake.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Be happy and glad because God will be good to you in heaven. In the same way people troubled the prophets before your time.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">You are like salt in the world. If salt has lost its taste, how can it be made salty again?  Salt that has no taste is good for nothing. The only thing to do is to throw it out on the road.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">You are like light in the world. A city built on a hill cannot be hidden.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">So also with a lamp. People do not light a lamp and put it under a basket. But they put it on the place for a lamp. Then all the people in the house can see its light.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">So, let your light shine to all people. Then they will see the good things you do. And they will praise your Father in heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Do not think that I have come to take away the law and the writings of the prophets. No,  I have not come to take them away. But I have come to do what they say must be done.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">I tell you the truth. Until the sky and the earth are taken away, not one small part of the law will be taken away, until everything has been done.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">So anyone who does not obey one of the smallest laws, and teaches other people not to obey it, will have the smallest part in the kingdom of heaven. But any one who obeys and teaches the law, will have a big part in the kingdom of heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">I tell you, you must do much better than the scribes and Pharisees. If you do not, then you will never go into the kingdom of heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">You have heard this said to men long ago, "Do not kill. Anyone who kills will be judged in court."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">But I tell you this. Anyone who is angry with his brother without having a good reason,  will be judged in court. Anyone who says wrong things to his brother will be judged for it in the big court. Anyone who says "You fool!" will be judged to go into hell fire.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Perhaps you are bringing your gift to God at his altar. There you remember that your brother has something against you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">If so, leave your gift there in front of the altar. First, go to your brother and make things right with him. Then come and give your gift to God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">If someone wants to take you to court, make an agreement with him quickly on the way.  If you do not, he will take you to the judge. The judge will give you to the guard, and the guard will put you in prison.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">I tell you the truth, you will not get out of prison until you have paid every piece of money.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">You have heard that the law says, "Do not commit adultery &lt;FI&gt;have another man or woman who is not your husband or wife&lt;Fi&gt; ."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">But I tell you that if a man looks at a woman and he wants her, then he has already committed adultery with her in his heart.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">If your right eye makes you do wrong, take it out and throw it away. It is better to lose a part of your body, than for your whole body to be thrown into hell.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">If your right hand makes you do wrong, cut it off and throw it away. It is better to lose a part of your body than for your whole body to be thrown into hell fire.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">The law said, "Any man who does not want to keep his wife must give her a paper to tell others she is no longer his wife."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">But I tell you, no man may send away his wife unless she has committed adultery. If he does send her away, he is making her commit adultery. And if a man marries a woman who has been sent away from her husband, he commits adultery.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">Also you have heard this said to men long ago, "You must not make a promise in Gods name and break it." And, "You must do for the Lord what you said you would do."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">But I tell you, do not make a promise in Gods name. Do not use the name of heaven,  because that is where God rules.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">Do not use the name of earth, because that is where God rests his feet. Do not use the name of Jerusalem, because it is the city of the great King.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">Do not make a promise by your head, because you cannot make one hair of your head white or black.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">You must mean "Yes" when you say "Yes". You must mean "No" when you say "No".  To say anything more than that is wrong.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">You have heard that the law says, "Take an eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">But I tell you, do not fight with anyone who does wrong to you. But if someone hits you on one side of your face, turn the other side to him also.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">If anyone takes you to court to get your shirt, let him have your coat also.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">If anyone wants you to help carry a load, go with him twice as far.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">When someone asks you for something, give it to him. When someone wants to borrow something from you, let him have it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">You have heard that the law says, "Love your neighbour and hate your enemy."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">But I tell you, love your enemies. Ask God to do good to those who trouble you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">In that way you will be sons of your Father in heaven. He makes his sun shine on both wrong and good people. He lets the rain fall on people who do right and on people who do wrong.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">If you love only those who love you, what reward will you get? Even the tax collectors do that.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">Do you speak to your brothers only? If so, you are not doing any better than other people. Even people who do not believe in God do that.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">You must be good in every way, as your Father in heaven is good in every way.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="6">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Do not do good things so that people will see you do them. If you do, you will get no reward from your Father in heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">So when you give money to poor people, do not send men in front of you to blow trumpets or horns. Some people do this in the meeting houses and on the streets so that people will praise them. They are not true to themselves. I tell you the truth. They have their pay already.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">But when you give money to poor people, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">In this way, what you give to the poor will be secret. Your Father sees secret things and he will reward you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">When you talk to God, do not be like people who are not true to themselves. They like to stand and talk to God in the meeting houses and at the street corners, so that people will see them. I tell you the truth. They have their reward already.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But when you talk to God, go into your room and shut the door. Then talk to your Father in secret. Your Father sees secret things and he will reward you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And when you talk to God, do not say words that mean nothing, over and over again.  People who do not believe in God do that. They think their god will hear them because they say many words.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Do not be like them. Your Father knows what you need before you ask him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">So talk to your God like this: "Our Father in heaven, may your name be kept holy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">"May your kingdom come. May your will be done on earth as it is in heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">"Give us our food for today.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">"Forgive us for the wrong things we have done, the way we forgive those who have done wrong things to us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">"Do not test us but help us, so that no one will make us do wrong. Deliver us from the evil one. The kingdom and power and praise belong to you for ever. Amen!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">If you forgive others for the wrong things they have done, then your Father in heaven will forgive you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">But if you do not forgive others, your Father will not forgive you for the wrong things you have done.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">When you are fasting &lt;FI&gt;not eating food for a time&lt;Fi&gt; , do not look sad. That is what people do who are not true to themselves. They look sad to show people they are fasting. I tell you the truth. They have their reward already.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">But when you fast, put oil on your head and wash your face as you do at other times.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Then people will not see that you are fasting. But your Father sees secret things, and he will reward you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Do not keep many things for yourself on earth. Insects and rust will spoil them. People will get in and steal them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">But keep things for yourself in heaven. Insects and rust will not spoil them there. People will not get in and steal them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">The place where you keep things is where your heart will be also.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">The body gets its light through the eyes. If you have good eyes, all your body will have light.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">But if your eyes are bad, all your body will be in darkness. If the light in you is dark, it will be very dark for you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">No man can work for two masters. He will hate one and love the other. Or he will obey one and despise the other. You cannot work for both God and money.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">So, I tell you this. Do not be troubled about what you will eat or drink to keep alive. Do not be troubled about what you will wear on your body. Life itself is worth more than food, and the body is worth more than clothes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Look at the birds that fly in the air. They do not plant or cut or keep any food. Yet your Father in heaven feeds them. Are you not worth more than birds?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Can any one of you live any longer by troubling yourself about these things?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And why are you troubled about clothes? See how the flowers grow in the fields. They do not work or make cloth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">I tell you, King Solomon was a great man. But he was not dressed as fine as one of these flowers.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">But Jesus said to them, Have you not read what David did? He and his men who were with him were hungry.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">He went into Gods house. Some bread was there for God. Davids men ate it. David did not have the right to eat it, nor the men who were with him. Only the priests have the right to eat it. But David took the bread and ate it. He also gave some of it to the men who were with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Have you never read in the books of the law that the priests in the temple break the Sabbath law on the Sabbath day? They are not punished for it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">I tell you, there is someone here who is greater than the temple.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">You do not know what this means, "I want you to be kind; I do not want a sacrifice." If you knew, then you would not have said what they did was wrong. What they did was not wrong.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">The Son of Man rules over the Sabbath day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Jesus left that place and went into the meeting house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">There was a man whose hand was thin and weak. The people asked Jesus, Is it right to heal a man on the Sabbath day? They wanted to find something wrong about Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Jesus said to them, If one of you had a sheep and it fell into a hole on the Sabbath day,  would you not take hold of it and pull it out?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">A man is worth much more than a sheep. So it is right to do good things on the Sabbath day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Then he said to the man, Hold out your hand. The man held out his hand and it was made well like the other hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Then the Pharisees went out and planned together how to kill Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Jesus knew about their plan, so he went away from there. Many people followed him and he healed them all.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">He told them not to tell where he was.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">So what Isaiah the prophet of God said, came true.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">He said, This is my servant. I have chosen him. I love him. I am very pleased with him. I will put my Spirit on him. He will judge the people who are not Jews.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">He will not fight or shout. No one will hear his voice in the streets.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">He will not break a stick that is already bent. He will not put out a light that burns only a little. What is right will win, because he will make it win.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Those who are not Jews will believe in him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Then the people brought a man to Jesus. The man had a bad spirit in him. He was blind and could not talk. Jesus healed him. Then the man could talk and see.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">All the people were surprised. They said, Is he Davids son?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">The Pharisees heard about it. They said, This man drives out bad spirits by the help of Beelzebub, the chief of bad spirits.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Jesus knew what they were thinking. He said to them, If one part of any country fights against the other part of the country, that country is broken down. If one part of any city or family fights against the other part of it, it cannot stand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">If Satan drives out Satan, he fights against himself. How then will his kingdom stand?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">If I drive out bad spirits by Beelzebub, how do your own people drive them out? Let them judge you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">But if I drive out bad spirits by Gods Spirit, then Gods kingdom is here with you now.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">If anyone wants to go into a strong mans house and steal his things, he must first tie the strong man. Then he can steal his things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Anyone who is not with me, is against me. Anyone who does not work with me is working against me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">That is why I tell you this. All wrong things that people do or say, will be forgiven. But people who say wrong things against the Holy Spirit will never be forgiven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">Anyone who says anything against the Son of Man will be forgiven. But anyone who says anything against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven. He will not be forgiven in this world or in the next world.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">Either make a tree good and its fruit good, or make a tree bad and its fruit bad. People know what kind of tree it is by the fruit on it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">You family of snakes! How can you say good things? You are wrong! The mouth will say what is in the heart.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">A good man has stored up good things in his heart, so he will say good things. A bad man has stored up wrong things in his heart, so he will say wrong things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">I tell you this. On the day when people are judged, they will pay for every empty word they have said.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">Because of your words, you will be called good. Or because of your words, you will be punished.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">Then some of the scribes and Pharisees said to him, Teacher, we want you to show us a sign.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">But Jesus answered them, The people today are bad. They have gone away from God.  They want a sign. No sign will be given them but the sign of the prophet Jonah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">Jonah was inside the big sea animal for three days and three nights. So the Son of Man will be in the ground for three days and three nights.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">When people are judged, the men of the city of Nineveh will stand up and speak against the people of today. The people of Nineveh stopped their wrong ways when Jonah told them Gods word. And the one who is here is greater than Jonah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">When people are judged, the Queen of the South will stand up and speak against the people of today. She came a long way to hear the wise talk of Solomon. And the one who is here is greater than Solomon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">When a bad spirit has gone out of a man, he goes through dry places. He looks for a place to rest, but he does not find any.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">Then he says, "I will go back to my house from where I came." When he comes back, he finds it is empty, clean, and all fixed up.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">Then he goes and brings seven other spirits with him. They are worse than he is. They go in and live there. Now the man is worse than he was at first. That is how it will be for the wrong people of today.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">While Jesus was still talking to the people, his mother and brothers stood outside. They wanted to talk to him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">Someone told him, Your mother and your brothers are standing outside. They want to talk to you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">But to the man who told him, he said, Who is my mother? Who are my brothers?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">He pointed to his disciples and said, These people are my mother and my brothers!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">Anyone who obeys my Father in heaven is my brother, my sister, and my mother.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="13">
      <VERS vnumber="1">That day Jesus left the house and sat down by the sea side.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Many people came to where he was. So he got into a boat and sat down. All the people stood on the land by the water.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">He taught the people many things by telling them stories. He said, Listen, a man went out to sow some seed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">As he sowed it, some of the seed fell on the road. Birds came and ate the seed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Some seed fell on the stony ground. Not much earth covered the stones. The seed started to grow right away because it was not deep in the ground.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">When the sun began to shine, it was too hot for the new plants. They died because they had no roots.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Some seed fell among the weeds. The weeds grew up and made the new plants die.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">But some seed fell on good ground. The seed grew and the plants gave more seed. Some plants gave thirty seeds. Some gave sixty. And some gave a hundred.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Everyone who has ears, listen!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">The disciples came to Jesus and asked him, Why do you tell the people these stories?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Jesus answered them, You can learn the secret things about the kingdom of heaven. But they cannot learn them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Anyone who already has something will get more, and he will have plenty. But he who does not have anything, even the little that he has will be taken away from him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">That is why I tell them stories. They look, but they do not see. They listen, but they do not hear or understand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">They make what Isaiah the prophet said long ago, come true. Isaiah said: "You will listen and listen, but you will not understand. You will look and look, but you will not see.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">The hearts of these people have no feeling. They do not hear well with their ears. And they have shut their eyes. They do not want to see with their eyes. They do not want to hear with their ears. They do not want to understand in their hearts. They do not want to turn to me. If they did turn, I would heal them."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">God is blessing your eyes because they see. God is blessing your ears because they hear.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">I tell you the truth. Many prophets and good men wanted to see what you see, but they did not see them. They wanted to hear what you hear, but they did not hear them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">So listen to hear what the story means, about the man who sowed the seed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">People listen to the message about the kingdom of heaven. If anyone does not understand it, the devil comes along and takes the message out of his heart. That person is like the seed which fell on the road.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Some seed fell on the stony ground. That is like a person who hears the message and right away he is glad to hear it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">But it does not go down deep in his heart. He believes it for a short time. When trouble or a hard time comes because of the message, he stops believing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Some seed fell among the weeds. That is like the person who hears the message. But he thinks about the things of this world. He wants to get money to be happy. These things push the message out of his heart. No good comes from it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Some seed fell on good ground. That is like a person who hears the message and understands it. Much good comes from it. Some people are like the seed that gave a hundred more seeds. Some people are like the seed that gave sixty. Some people are like the seed that gave thirty.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Jesus told the people another story. He said, The kingdom of heaven is like this. A man sowed good seed in his field.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">While people were sleeping, a bad man came and sowed weeds among the good seed.  Then he went away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">The good seed grew and the plants gave more seeds. Then the weeds grew too.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">The servants came and said to the man who owned the field, "Sir, did you not sow good seed in your field? How did the weeds get here?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">He answered them, "A bad man has done this." They asked him, "Do you want us to go and pull up the weeds?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">"No," said the man. "If you pull up the weeds, then the good plants will come up with them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Let them both grow together until the harvest time. When it is time to cut it, I will say to the men who cut it, Cut the weeds first. Tie them in bundles to be burned. Then put the grain into my storehouse."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Jesus told the people another story. He said, The kingdom of heaven is like this. A man took a mustard seed and planted it in his field.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">A mustard seed is the smallest of all seeds. But the plant that grows from it is bigger than other plants. It is like a tree. It is so big that birds come and live in the branches.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">Jesus told them another story. He said, The kingdom of heaven is like this. A woman took yeast and mixed it with many cups of flour. The yeast went all through the flour.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Jesus told the people all these things in stories. He did not tell them anything without a story.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">What the prophet of God said long ago, came true. He said, I will use stories. I will tell things that have been secret since the world was made.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">Then Jesus left the people and went into the house. His disciples came to him. They said,  Tell us the meaning of the story about the weeds in the field.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">Jesus answered, The person who sows the good seed is the Son of Man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">The field is the world. The good seed means the people who belong to the kingdom. The weeds mean those who belong to the bad one.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">The bad man who planted the weeds is the devil. The harvest time is the end of this world. The men who cut the harvest are angels.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">The weeds are gathered and burned in a fire. That is the way it will be at the end of the world.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">The Son of Man will send his angels. They will gather everything that is bad and the people who do bad things. They will take them out of his kingdom.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">They will put them into the big fire. There they will cry and make a noise with their teeth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">Then the people who are right with God will shine like the sun in their Fathers kingdom.  Everyone who has ears, listen.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">The kingdom of heaven is like this. Something worth a lot of money is buried in a field.  A man found it and covered it again. He was so glad that he went and sold everything he had. Then he bought that field.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">The kingdom of heaven is like this. A trader was looking for fine stones called pearls.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">He found a pearl that was worth a lot of money. Then he went and sold everything he had and bought it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">The kingdom of heaven is like this. A fish net was thrown into the sea. It caught all kinds of fish.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">When it was full, the men pulled it to the land. They sat down and picked out the good fish into baskets. But they threw the bad fish away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">That is the way it will be at the end of the world. The angels will come and take the bad people away from the good people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">They will put the bad people into the never-ending hell fire. There they will cry and make a noise with their teeth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="51">Jesus asked, Have you understood all these stories? The disciples said, Yes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="52">Then Jesus said to them, So anyone who knows the law and has learned about the kingdom of heaven, is like the headman of a house. He can bring both new things and old things out of what he has stored up.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="53">When Jesus had finished telling these stories, he went away from there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="54">He went back to his home town and he taught people in their meeting house. They were very much surprised and said, Where did he learn all this? Where did he get the power to do these big works?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="55">Is he not the carpenters son? Is not Mary his mother? Are not James, Joseph, Simon, and Judas his brothers?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="56">Are not his sisters all here with us? Where did he get all this?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="57">They did not understand Jesus. Jesus said to them, Other people honour a man who is a prophet. But the people in his own country and home do not honour him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="58">Jesus could not do many big works in that place because the people did not believe in him.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="14">
      <VERS vnumber="1">At this time Herod the ruler heard of Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">He said to his servants, This is John the Baptizer. He is risen from death. That is why he is able to do such great work.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Herod had taken John and tied him up. He put him in prison. He did this because of Herodias. She was the wife of his brother Philip.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">John had said to Herod, It is not right for you to have her for your wife.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Herod wanted to kill John, but he was afraid of the people. They thought John was a prophet, a man of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">On Herods birthday, the daughter of Herodias danced for the people who were there.  She pleased Herod.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">He was so pleased that he promised to give her anything she asked for.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">The girls mother told her what to ask for. So she said, Give me here, on a plate, the head of John the Baptizer.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">The king was very sorry to do this. But he had made a promise. And all the people who were there had heard him promise. So he gave orders to do it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">He sent someone to the prison to cut off Johns head.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Johns head was brought on a plate. It was given to the girl. And she took it to her mother.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Then Johns disciples came and took his body and buried it. They went and told Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">When Jesus heard this, he went away from there in a boat. He went to a lonely place by himself. The people heard that he went away and they followed him. They walked from the towns around there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">When Jesus got out of the boat, he saw many people. He was sorry for them and he healed those who were sick.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">In the evening the disciples came to him. They said, This is a lonely place. And the time is late. Send these people away so they can go to the farms and villages to buy food for themselves.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Jesus said to them, They need not go away. You give them food to eat.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">They said, We have here only five loaves of bread and two fish.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Jesus said, Bring them here to me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Then Jesus told the people to sit down on the grass. He took the five loaves of bread and the two fish. He looked up to heaven and thanked God for them. Then he broke the bread and gave it to the disciples. The disciples gave it to the people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">They all ate and had enough. They gathered twelve baskets full of pieces that were left.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">The number of men who ate was about five thousand, besides some women and children.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Then Jesus told the disciples, You get into the boat right away and go ahead of me to the other side of the sea. And I will send these people away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">After he had sent them away, he went up on the hill by himself to talk with God. Evening came and he was there alone.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">The boat was far out on the water by this time. The water was beating against the boat and the wind was blowing the wrong way.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">When it was almost morning, Jesus came to them. He was walking on the water.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">His disciples saw him walking on the water. They were afraid, and said, It is a spirit!  Then they shouted loudly because they were afraid.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Then Jesus spoke to them right away. He said, Be glad! It is I. Do not fear.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Peter said, Lord, if it is you, tell me to come to you on the water.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Jesus said, Come. So Peter got out of the boat. He walked on the water and went toward Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">He saw what the wind did. Then he was afraid and began to go down in the water. He called out, Lord, save me!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Right away Jesus put out his hand and took hold of him. He said, You do not believe very much in me! Why did you not believe?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">When they got into the boat, the wind stopped blowing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">Then the men in the boat bowed down in front of Jesus. They said, You really are the Son of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">They crossed over the sea and came to the land at Gennesaret.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">The men there knew him and sent word to the people in all the country around. They brought all the sick people to him.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="15">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Then some Pharisees and scribes from Jerusalem came to Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">They asked him, Why do your disciples break the law our fathers made? They do not wash their hands before they eat.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Jesus asked them, Why do you break Gods law so that you can keep your own law?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">God said, "Respect your father and your mother." And God said, "Anyone who says wrong things to his father or his mother will surely die."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">But you say, "Tell your father or your mother that you have given to God what you were going to give to them." You say, "If anyone says that, then he does not need to help his father or mother."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">You make Gods law to mean nothing so you can keep your own laws!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">You are not true to yourselves! What Isaiah said about you was true. He said,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">"These people respect me with their mouth but their heart is far from me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">They do not mean it in their hearts when they worship me. Their teachings are only the words of men."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Jesus called the people to him. He said to them, Listen to me and understand what I say.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">What goes into a persons mouth does not make him dirty. But what comes out of a persons mouth makes him dirty.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Then the disciples came to Jesus. They said, The Pharisees were angry when they heard what you said. Did you know that?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Jesus answered, Every plant that my Father in heaven did not plant will be pulled out by the roots.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Leave them alone. They are blind men who are trying to lead blind men. If a blind man leads a blind man, they will both fall into a hole.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Peter said to Jesus, Tell us the meaning of that story.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Jesus said, Do you still not understand?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Do you not know this? What goes into the mouth goes into the stomach, and then it goes out of the body.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">But what comes out of the mouth, comes from the heart. This is what makes a person dirty.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Here is what comes from the heart: wrong thoughts, killing people, all kinds of adultery,  stealing, lying, and saying wrong things about people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">These things make a person dirty. To eat with hands that are not washed does not make him dirty.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Jesus left that place and went to the country of Tyre and Sidon. 22A woman of the people of Canaan was in that country. She called out, Sir, you are the Son of David.  Help me! My daughter is being troubled very much by a bad spirit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Jesus did not answer her. His disciples came to him and said, Send her away. She keeps calling after us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">He said, I was sent only to the people of Israel. They are like lost sheep.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">But the woman came and bowed down in front of Jesus and worshipped him. She said,  Sir, help me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">He said, It is not right to take the childrens food and give it to the little dogs.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">She answered, Yes, sir. But even the little dogs eat the food that falls from the tables of their masters.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Then Jesus answered, Woman, you believe very much. The thing you want me to do will be done. And her daughter was healed at that very time.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Jesus went on from there along the Sea of Galilee. He went up on a hill and sat down there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Many people came to him. They brought sick people with them. Some were lame. Some were hurt. Some were blind. Some could not talk. And there were many others. They laid them down in front of Jesus. And he healed them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">The people were surprised. They saw that people who had not been able to talk were talking. They saw that people who were hurt were made well. They saw that lame people were walking. They saw that blind people could see. And they praised the God of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Jesus called his disciples to him. He said, I share the suffering of the people. They have been with me for three days and they have nothing to eat. I do not want to send them away hungry. If they go away hungry, they will get weak and fall on the way.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">The disciples said to him, Where can we get enough food in this lonely place to feed so many people?</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">The Pharisees and Sadducees came to Jesus. They wanted to test him, so they asked him to show them a sign from the sky.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">He answered them, In the evening you say, "It will be a nice day tomorrow because the sky is red."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">In the morning you say, "It will be a stormy day, because the sky is red and there are clouds." You know the meaning of these signs in the sky. But you do not know the meaning of the signs about the time in which we are living.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">People today are wrong. They have gone away from God. They want a sign. No sign will be given them but the sign of Jonah. Then Jesus went away and left them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">When the disciples reached the other side of the sea, they found they had forgotten to bring any bread with them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Jesus said, Watch! Do not let the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees spoil you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">The disciples said to each other, He said that because we did not bring any bread.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Jesus knew what they were saying. He said to them, You dont believe very much in me.  Why are you saying to each other, "We have no bread".</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Do you not yet understand? When there were five thousand people, there were only five loaves of bread. Do you not remember how many baskets full of pieces you gathered up?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">When there were four thousand people, there were only seven loaves. Do you not remember how many baskets full of pieces you gathered up?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Why do you not understand that I was not talking about bread? Take care. Do not let the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees spoil you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Then they understood that he was not talking about bread. He did not mean that the yeast of bread would spoil them. They understood that he was talking about the things the Pharisees and Sadducees taught.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Jesus went to the country of Caesarea Philippi. He asked his disciples, I am the Son of Man. Whom do people say I am?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">They answered, Some people say you are John the Baptizer. Others say you are Elijah.  And others say you are Jeremiah or one of the prophets.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Jesus said to them, Whom do you say I am?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Simon Peter answered, You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Jesus answered, Simon, Jonahs son, God has blessed you. No person on earth has showed you this. But my Father in heaven has showed you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">I tell you this. You are Peter. On this rock I will build my church. The power of death will not destroy it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">I will give you the keys to the kingdom of heaven. What you tie on earth will be tied in heaven. What you set free on earth will be set free in heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Then Jesus said to the disciples, Do not tell anyone that I am the Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">From that time on, Jesus began to teach his disciples. He said, I must go to Jerusalem. I will have much trouble from the leaders, the chief priests, and the scribes. I will be killed.  On the third day, I will be raised from death.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Peter took him to one side and began to talk to him. He said, Lord! May God stop it!  This must never happen to you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">But Jesus turned to Peter and said, Get away from me Satan! You are trying to make me do wrong. You are not thinking the way God thinks, but the way people think.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Then Jesus told his disciples, If anyone wants to come with me, he must leave what he himself wants to do. He must be willing to carry his cross and come with me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Anyone who wants to keep his life will lose it. And anyone who gives up his life for my sake will find it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">What good will it do a man if he gets the whole world for himself, but loses his life? What can a person give to get back his life?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">The Son of Man will come with his angels and will be great like his Father. Then he will pay every man for what he has done.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">I tell you the truth. Some people are standing here who will not die before they see the Son of Man come in his kingdom.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="17">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Six days after this, Jesus took Peter, James, and his brother John with him. He led them up a hill by themselves.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Jesus was changed in front of them. His face was bright like the sun. His clothes were white, like light.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Then they saw Moses and Elijah talking with Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Peter said to Jesus, Lord, this is a good place for us. If you want, we will make three places here, one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">While he was saying this, a bright cloud came over them. A voice in the cloud said, This is my dear Son. I am very pleased with him. Listen to him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">When the disciples heard it, they bowed their faces to the ground. They were very much afraid.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">But Jesus came and touched them. He said, Get up. Do not fear.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">When they looked up, they saw no one but Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">When they came down the hill, Jesus said to them, Do not tell anyone what you saw. Do not tell it until after the Son of Man has been raised from death.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">The disciples asked him, Why do the scribes say that Elijah must come first?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Jesus answered, Elijah does come. He will get everything ready.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">I tell you that Elijah has come already. The people did not know him. And they did to him just what they wanted to do. So also the Son of Man will be troubled by them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Then the disciples knew that he was talking about John the Baptizer.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">They came to the people. A man came and kneeled in front of Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">He said, Sir, help my son. A bad spirit is in him and he has much trouble. Often he falls into the fire, and often he falls into the water.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">I brought him to your disciples, but they could not heal him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Jesus said, You people today do not believe. You have turned away from God. How long must I be with you? How long must I put up with you? Bring the boy here to me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Jesus talked to the bad spirit and he came out of the boy. The boy was healed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Then the disciples came to Jesus alone. They asked him, Why could we not drive the bad spirit out?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Jesus said to them, Because you do not believe enough. I tell you the truth. If your strength to believe were as much as a little mustard seed, you could say to this hill, "Go,  move over to that place!" And it would move. Nothing is too hard for you to do.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">But this kind of bad spirit does not come out of a person unless people ask God and fast &lt;FI&gt;do not eat food for a time&lt;Fi&gt; .</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">They were travelling in Galilee. Jesus said to his disciples, The Son of Man will be given over to men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">They will kill him. But he will be raised on the third day. This troubled the disciples very much.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">They came to Capernaum. There the men who were collecting the tax for the temple came to Peter. They asked him, Does not your teacher pay the tax for the temple?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Peter said, Yes, he does. When he came into the house, Jesus spoke to him about it first. He said, Simon, what do you think? From whom do kings on earth take taxes? Do they take them from their own people or from other people?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Peter said, From other people. Jesus said, Then the sons do not pay a tax.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">But we must not make them think something wrong about us. So go to the sea. Throw a fish-hook into the water. Take the first fish you catch. Open its mouth and you will see a piece of money. Take it and pay them the tax for you and me.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="18">
      <VERS vnumber="1">The disciples came to Jesus at that time. They said, Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Jesus called a child to him. He had the child stand in front of them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">He said, I tell you the truth. If your hearts do not change and become like hearts of children, you will never go into the kingdom of heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">So anyone who feels himself small like this little child is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">If anyone takes in a child like this for my sake, he takes in me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">These little children believe in me. If anyone makes one of them do wrong, he will be punished. He will have worse trouble than if a big stone were tied to his neck and he were thrown into the deep sea.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">There will be trouble in the world because people make other people do wrong! People will do wrong. But the person who makes another person do wrong will have trouble.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">If your hand or your foot makes you do wrong, cut it off and throw it away! It is better for you to enter into life without hands or feet than to have two hands and two feet and be thrown into the fire that burns for ever.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">If your eye makes you do wrong, pull it out and throw it away! It is better for you to enter into life with one eye, than to have two eyes and be thrown into the hell fire.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Do not think badly of these little children. I tell you this. They have angels in heaven.  And all the time their angels can see the face of my father who is in heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">The Son of Man came to save anyone who is lost.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">What do you think about this? A man has a hundred sheep. One of them is lost. Will he not leave the ninety-nine sheep on the hills and go to look for the one that is lost? Yes, he will.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">I tell you the truth. When he finds it, he is more happy to see that one than the ninety-nine that were not lost.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">In the same way, my Father in heaven does not want one of these little children to be lost.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">If your brother does something wrong to you, go to him. Talk alone to him and tell him what he has done. If he listens to you, you have kept your brother as a friend.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">But if he does not listen to you, take one or two others with you to talk to him. Then two or three people will hear every word and can prove what was said.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">If he does not listen to them, tell the church. If he does not listen to the church, treat him as one who does not believe in God and as bad as a tax collector.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">I tell you the truth. What you tie on earth will be tied in heaven. What you set free on earth will be set free in heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">I tell you another thing. If two of you on earth agree together to ask for something, my Father in heaven will do it for them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Where two or three people meet together in my name, I am there with them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Then Peter came to Jesus and asked him, Lord, how many times should I forgive my brother when he does wrong things to me? Should I forgive him seven times?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Jesus answered him, I say not seven times only, but seventy times seven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">In that way the kingdom of heaven is like this. A king was ready to finish his business with his servants.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">The first servant was brought in. He owed the king a very large sum of money.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">He could not pay it. So his master said, "Go sell him, his wife, his children, and everything he has, and pay me!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">So the servant bowed down in front of him. He begged, "Sir, give me time. I will pay everything."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">His master was sorry for him and let him go. He did not make him pay the money.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">That same servant went out and met another servant. This man owed him a much smaller sum of money. He caught him by the throat and said, Pay me what you owe me!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Then this servant bowed down in front of him. He begged, "Give me time. I will pay you."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">But he said, "No." He went and put the man in prison until he could pay what he owed him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">The other servants saw what he did. They were very sad. They went and told their master everything that had been done.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">Then his master called the first servant to him. He said, "You bad man! I let you go. I did not make you pay all you owed me, because you begged me to be kind to you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">You should have been kind to the other servant, as I was kind to you."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">His master was very angry. He turned the servant over to the prison guards until he could pay all he owed him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">That is like what my Father in heaven will do to every one of you, if you do not forgive your brother from your heart.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="19">
      <VERS vnumber="1">When Jesus had finished this talk, he left Galilee. He went away to the part of Judea that is on the other side of the Jordan River.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Many people followed him. He healed them there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">The Pharisees came to Jesus to test him. They asked, Is it right for a man to send his wife away from him for any reason?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Jesus answered, Have you not read this? From the time God first made people, he made them a man and a woman.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">God said, "A man must leave his father and mother and must stay with his wife. The two of them will be like one person."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">So they are not two people any more, but they are one person. Man must not separate what God has joined together.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">They said to Jesus, Then why did Moses make this law? He said that a man may give his wife a paper to show that he does not want her any more. Then he may send her away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Jesus said to them, Moses wrote that law because your hearts are so hard. That is why he let you send your wives away. But in the beginning it was not that way.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">But I tell you this. No man may send his wife away unless she has committed adultery. If he does, and if he marries another woman, he commits adultery. And if a man marries a woman who has been sent away by her husband, he commits adultery.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">The disciples said to him, If a man and woman are like that, then it is better not to marry.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Jesus said, Not everyone can agree to that. But God has chosen some not to be married.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Some men cannot marry because they were born that way. Some were made that way by men. Others said, "I will not marry, for the sake of the kingdom of heaven." Anyone who can do this, should do it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Then people brought children to Jesus. They wanted him to put his hands on them and ask God to bless them. The disciples tried to stop the people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">But Jesus said, Let the children come to me. Do not try to stop them. The kingdom of heaven belongs to people like them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">So he put his hands on the children. Then he went away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">A man came to Jesus and said, Teacher, what good thing must I do so that I will live for ever?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Jesus said, Why do you ask me about what is good? Only God is good. If you want to live for ever, you must keep Gods laws.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">The man said, Which laws? Jesus said, Do not kill. Do not commit adultery. Do not steal. Do not tell lies.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Respect your father and your mother. Love your neighbour as you love yourself.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">The young man said, I have kept all those laws. What more must I do?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Jesus said, If you want to be all right, go and sell everything you have. Give the money to poor people. For this you will be rich in heaven. Then come and go with me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">When the young man heard that, he was sad, because he was very rich. So he went away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Then Jesus said to his disciples, I tell you the truth. It is very hard for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And I tell you this also. It is easier for a big animal like a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">When the disciples heard this, they were very much surprised. They said, Then who can be saved?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Jesus looked at them and said, Men cannot do it, but God can do anything.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Then Peter said, See, we have left all things and have come with you. So what will we have?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Jesus said to them, I tell you the truth. In the new world, the Son of Man will be great.  He will sit on his throne of glory &lt;FI&gt;big chair of a king&lt;Fi&gt; to rule. Then you who have come with me will also sit on twelve thrones. You will judge the twelve tribes of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">If anyone has left his house, his brothers, his sisters, his father, his mother, his children,  or his farms for my sake, he will receive a hundred times as much as he has left. And he will live for ever.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">But many people who are first will be last, and those who are last will be first.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="20">
      <VERS vnumber="1">The kingdom of heaven is like this. A man owned a farm. Early in the morning he went out to look for men to work on his farm.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">He agreed to pay them a days wages and sent them out to his farm.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">About nine oclock he went out again. He saw some men standing around at the market.  They were not working.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">He said to them, "You go out to work on the farm too. I will pay you what is right." And they went to work.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">The man went out again at twelve oclock and at three oclock. He did the same as he had done before.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">About five oclock he went out again and found other men standing around. He said to them, "Why have you been standing here all day? Why are you not working?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">They said, "No man has asked us to work." So he said to them, "You go out to work on the farm too."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">When evening came, the man who owned the farm said to his manager, "Call the workmen and pay them. Begin with those who came last and end with those who came first."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Each of the men who started work at five oclock was paid a days wages.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Those who started work first thought they would get more than that. But they also were paid a days wages.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">They took it, but they were angry and talked against the man who owned the farm.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">They said, "These men came last, and worked only one hour. Yet you paid them the same as you paid us. We worked all day, when the sun was hot."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">But he said to one of them, "My friend, I am not doing any wrong to you. You agreed that I should pay you a days wages. Did you not?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Take your money and go. I want to give the last man the same pay as I gave you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">It is my own money. Can I not do with it as I like? Do you think it is a wrong thing for me to be kind?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">In the same way, people who are last will be first, and those who are first will be last.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">On the way to Jerusalem, Jesus took the twelve disciples with him, away from the people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">He said to them, We are going to Jerusalem. The Son of Man will be given over to the chief priests and scribes. They will judge him and say he must die.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">They will give him over to rulers who are not Jews. They will make fun of him. They will beat him and nail him to a cross. On the third day, he will be raised.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Then Zebedees wife came with her sons to Jesus. She bowed down in front of him and asked him to do something for her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Jesus asked, What do you want me to do for you? The woman said, These are my two sons. Promise that in your kingdom one may sit at your right and the other at your left.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">But Jesus said, You do not know what you are asking for. Can you drink from the cup that I will drink? Yes, they said. We can.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Then Jesus said to them, You will drink what I drink. But I cannot choose who will sit at my right or at my left. My Father has planned who will sit there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">When the other ten disciples heard about it, they were angry with the two brothers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">But Jesus called them to him and said, You know that those who rule over countries make their people obey them. The great men will tell the others what to do.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">But that is not the way it is among you. Anyone among you who wants to be great will help the others.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Anyone among you who wants to be first will be a servant to the others.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">The Son of Man did not come to have others help him. But he came to help others. He came to give his life to make many people free.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">As Jesus and the disciples left the city of Jericho, many people followed him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Two blind men were sitting by the road. They heard that Jesus was passing that way. So they shouted, Sir, you are the Son of David. Help us!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">The people said to them, Be quiet! But they shouted louder, Sir, Son of David! Help us!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">Jesus stopped and called the men to him. He asked, What do you want me to do for you?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">They said, Sir, we want to see.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Jesus was very sorry for them as he shared in their suffering. He touched their eyes, and right then they were able to see. They went with him.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="21">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Jesus and his disciples came near to Jerusalem. They came to the village of Bethphage by the hill called the Mount of Olives. Then Jesus sent two of his disciples ahead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">He said to them, Go into the village in front of you. As soon as you go in, you will find a donkey for riding, and her young one. They are tied there. Untie them and bring them to me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">If anyone says anything to you, tell him, "The Lord needs them. He will send them back soon."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">This happened, and what the prophet of God said long ago, came true.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">He said, Tell the people of Zion: See, your king is coming to you. He is not proud. He rides a donkey. It is a young animal.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">The disciples went and did what Jesus told them to do.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">They brought the donkey and her young one. They put their coats on them. Then Jesus got on to ride.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Many people spread their coats on the road. Others cut leaves from the palm trees and put them on the road.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">People in front of him and people behind him shouted, Praise the Son of David! God bless him who comes in the name of the Lord! Praise him in heaven!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">When Jesus came into Jerusalem, all the people there were very excited. They said,  Who is this?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">The people who were with Jesus said, This is Jesus from the town of Nazareth in Galilee. He is a prophet.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Jesus went into the temple of God. He drove out all the people who were buying and selling in the temple. He threw down the tables of the money changers. He pushed down the seats of those who sold doves.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">He said to them, The holy writings say, "My house shall be called a house where people talk with God." But you have made it a place for people who steal!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Blind people came to Jesus in the temple. People who could not walk came to him. And he healed them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">The chief priests and the scribes saw the big works that Jesus did. They saw the children calling out in the temple, God save the Son of David! They were angry.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">They asked Jesus, Do you hear what they are saying? Jesus answered, Yes. Have you never read this? "You like the praise of children and babies."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Then he left them and went out of the city to Bethany. He stayed there for the night.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">In the morning he went back to the city. On the way he was hungry.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Along the road he saw a fig tree. He went to the tree. There was no fruit on it, only leaves. He said to the tree, No fruit will ever grow on you again! Right away the tree died.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">The disciples saw it and were surprised. They said, So soon the fig tree has died!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Jesus said to them, I tell you the truth. Believe God. Do not doubt him. Then you can do what I did to this fig tree. But that is not all. You can even say to this hill, "Go and jump into the sea" and it will be done.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">When you ask God for anything, believe that you will have it. Then you will have it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">He came to the temple and went in and taught the people. The chief priests and the leaders of the people came to him. They asked, What right have you to do these things?  Who gave you the right to do them?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Jesus answered them, I will ask you a question also. If you answer me, I will answer you. I will tell you what right I have to do these things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Who gave John the right to baptise people? Did God or did men? So they talked it over together. They said, If we say, "God gave John the right to do it," he will say to us,  "Then why did you not believe him?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">But if we say, "Men gave him the right to do it," we have the people to fear, because all the people say that John was a prophet.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">So they answered Jesus, We do not know. Then Jesus said, Neither will I tell you what right I have to do these things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">What do you think about this? A man had two sons. He went to the first one and said,  "Son, go and work today on my farm."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">The son said, "No, I will not go." But he changed his mind and went.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">The man went to the second son and said the same thing. The son answered, "Yes, sir, I will go." But he did not go.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Which of the two sons did what his father wanted him to do? They said, The first one.  Then Jesus said, I tell you the truth. The tax collectors and women who commit adultery by selling their bodies, are going into the kingdom of God ahead of you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">John came to you to tell you the right way. But you did not believe him. The tax collectors and women who commit adultery believed him. And even when you saw that,  you did not change your minds and believe him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">Listen to another story. A man planted a farm of vines for growing fruit called grapes.  He put a fence of small trees around it. He dug a place to press the juice from the fruit.  He built a high house from which men could watch over the farm. He let some men pay to use it. Then he went to a country far away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">When it was near the time to cut the fruit, he sent his servants to those men. He wanted to have some of the fruit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">The men caught the servants. They beat one of them and killed another one of them.  They threw stones at another one.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">Then the man sent other servants. There were more than the first time. The men did the same to them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">Last of all he sent his son to them. He said, "They will respect my son."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">When the men saw the son, they said to each other, "This is the one who will have everything when his father dies. Let us kill him and we will have it all."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">They caught him, dragged him off the farm, and killed him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">When the owner of the farm comes, what will he do to those men?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">They answered, He will kill those bad men, and will give the farm to other men who will give him the fruit when it is time.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">Jesus said, Have you never read in the holy writings "The stone which the builders would not use is now the chief corner stone. The Lord did this. It looks wonderful to us"?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">So I tell you, the kingdom of God will be taken from you. It will be given to the people who do what they should do in it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">If anyone falls on this stone, he will be broken to pieces. But if this stone falls on anyone,  it will crush him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">The chief priests and the Pharisees heard the stories Jesus told, and they knew he was talking about them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">They wanted to catch him, but they feared the people. The people thought Jesus was a prophet.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="22">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Jesus told them other stories.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">He said, The kingdom of heaven is like this. A king made a wedding for his son.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">The king sent his servants to call the people who had been asked to the wedding. But they would not come.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">He sent other servants to call them. He said, "Tell those who were asked to the wedding that my dinner is cooked. The cows and bullocks have been killed. Everything is ready.  Come now to the wedding."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">The people did not listen, but went away. One went to his farm. One went to his business.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">The others caught his servants, treated them very badly, and killed them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">The king was very angry. He sent his soldiers to kill the men who had killed his servants.  And he burned their city.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Then he said to his servants, "The wedding is ready. But those who were asked to come were not good enough.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Go out on the roads. Call all the people you find to come to the wedding."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">So those servants went out on the roads. They brought all the people they could find,  both bad and good people. Then the room was full of people for the wedding.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">The king came in to look at the people. He saw one man there who was not wearing the right clothes for a wedding.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">The king said to him, "My friend, why did you come here without putting on the right clothes for a wedding?" The man did not answer.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Then the king said to his servants, "Tie his hands and his feet. Put him in a dark place outside. People there will cry and grind &lt;FI&gt;make a noise with&lt;Fi&gt; their teeth."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Many people are asked to come, but only a few are chosen.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Then the Pharisees went away. They planned how to make Jesus say something wrong.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">They sent their disciples to him with some of Herods people. They said, Teacher, we know that you are true. We know that you teach the true way of God. You do not fear any person, or care how great he is.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">So tell us. What do you think? Is it right to pay taxes to Caesar or is it not?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Jesus knew they were trying to get him into trouble. So he said to them, Why are you trying to get me to do wrong? You are not true to yourselves!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Show me a piece of money used for tax. They brought him a piece of money.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Whose picture and name is this? he asked.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">They said, Caesars.Then he said to them, Give to Caesar what belongs to Caesar. And give to God what belongs to God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">When they heard that, they were surprised. They left him and went away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">The same day some of the Sadducees came to Jesus. They say that people do not rise from death.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">They came to ask him a question. They said, Teacher, Moses gave us this law: "If a man dies and has no children, then his brother must marry the wife and raise a family for his brother."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">There were seven brothers among us. The first one married. He died and left no children.  So his brother married the wife.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">The same thing happened to the second brother, and the third one, and all seven of them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Last of all, the woman died.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Now then, when people rise from death, which of the seven brothers will have her for his wife? They all married her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Jesus answered, You are wrong! You do not know what the holy writings say. And you do not know what power God has.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">When people rise from death, men and women do not marry. But they are like angels in heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">People do rise from death! Have you never read what God said to you?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">He said, "I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob." He is not the God of dead people, but of living people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">When the people heard this, they were surprised at his teaching.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">The Pharisees heard that the Sadducees could not answer Jesus. So they got together.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">One of them was a man who taught Gods law. He asked Jesus a question to try him out.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">Teacher, he said, which law is the greatest law of all?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">Jesus said, "Love the Lord your God with all your heart. Love him with all your soul,  and love him with all your mind."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">This is the first and greatest law.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">The second law of God is like it. "Love your neighbour as you love yourself."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">All that is written in the books of the law and the books of the prophets is about these two laws.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">While the Pharisees were still there, Jesus asked them a question.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">He said, What do you think about Christ? Whose son is he? They said, He is Davids son.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">Jesus asked, Then how can David call him "Lord"? He said, by the Spirit,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">"The Lord said to my Lord, Sit beside me until I make you master over your enemies."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">David calls Christ his Lord. How can Christ be Davids son?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">No one could answer him a word. And after that day, everyone feared to ask him any more questions.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="23">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Then Jesus talked to the people and to his disciples.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">He said, The scribes and Pharisees have taken Moses place.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">So obey and do everything they tell you to do. But do not do what they do. They say what should be done, but they do it not.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">They make heavy loads and put them on peoples backs. But they themselves will not put up even one finger to help carry the loads.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">They do all their work to be seen by people. They wear bigger and bigger boxes with Gods word in. And they make wider and wider borders on their gowns.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">They want to sit in the best places at the feasts. They want to have the front seats in the meeting houses.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">They want people to greet them in the market, and to call them "Teacher".</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">But people should not call you "Teacher". You have one Teacher. And you are all brothers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Do not call anyone on earth your "Father". You have one Father. He is in heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">People should not call you "Master". You have one Master. He is the Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">The person who is greatest among you will help the others.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Anyone who puts himself up will be brought down. And anyone who puts himself down will be brought up.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">You scribes and Pharisees will have trouble. You are not true to yourselves! You shut the door of the kingdom of heaven so people cannot go in. You yourselves do not go in,  and you stop those who were going in.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">You scribes and Pharisees will have trouble. You who are not true to yourselves! You take away the homes of women whose husbands are dead. You cover up your wrong ways by talking big to God for a long time. Because of that, you will be punished harder.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">You scribes and Pharisees will have trouble. You who are not true to yourselves! You travel over sea and land to win one person to believe what you believe. And when he believes, you make him twice as fit for hell as you are.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">You blind leaders will have trouble. You say that if anyone makes a promise in the name of the temple, he does not have to keep that promise. But if anyone makes a promise in the name of the gold on the temple, he must keep that promise.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">You fools and blind men! Which is greater, the gold or the temple that makes the gold holy?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And you say that if anyone makes a promise in the name of Gods altar, he does not have to keep that promise. But if anyone makes a promise in the name of the sacrifice, he must keep that promise.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">You fools and blind people! Which is greater, the sacrifice or the place that makes the sacrifice holy?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">So if anyone makes a promise by Gods altar, he makes his promise by it and by all that is on it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">If anyone makes a promise by the temple, he makes his promise by the temple and by God who lives in the temple.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">If anyone makes a promise by heaven, he makes his promise by Gods big chair called a throne and by God who sits on the throne.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">You scribes and Pharisees will have trouble. You who are not true to yourselves! You give God a tenth part of small garden plants. But you have not done those bigger matters of the law. You have not judged in the right way. You have not been kind. You have not believed God. You should be doing these things and the other things too.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">You blind leaders! You take a fly out of your cup, but you drink down a big animal like a camel!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">You scribes and Pharisees will have trouble. You who are not true to yourselves! You wash the outside of a cup and a dish clean. But inside they are full of greed and wrong ways!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">You blind Pharisees! First clean the inside of the cup and the dish so that the outside will be clean too.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">You scribes and Pharisees will have trouble. You who are not true to yourselves! You are like graves that have been painted white. Outside they look very nice. But inside they are full of dead mens bones and all kinds of dirt.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">So it is with you. You look right on the outside. But inside you are full of lies and wrong ways.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">You scribes and Pharisees will have trouble. You who are not true to yourselves! You build places to bury the prophets and fix up graves of good men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">You say, "If we had lived in the days of our fathers, we would not have helped to kill the prophets of God."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">So you prove that you are the sons of the men who killed the prophets.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">Finish doing what your fathers started to do.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">You snakes-a whole family of snakes! You cannot get away! You will be judged and sent to hell.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">That is why I send you prophets, wise men, and teachers. You will kill some of them and nail them to a cross. And you will beat some of them in your meeting houses and trouble them from one town to another.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">So you will be punished for all the blood of every good man that is on the ground. I mean all the blood from the time of Abel, who was a good man, to Zechariah, the son of Barachiah. You killed him between the temple and Gods altar.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">I tell you the truth. The people who are still living now will be punished for all these things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">Jerusalem! Jerusalem! You kill the prophets. You throw stones to kill the men who are sent to you! How often I have wanted to gather your people together, as a mother hen gathers her little ones under her wings. But you would not come!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">Now you are left alone in your house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">I tell you this. You will not see me again until the time when you say, "God bless him who comes in the name of the Lord."</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="21">His master said, "You have done well. You are a good servant. I can trust you. You have taken good care of a few things. I will put you in charge of many things. Come, have a good time with your master."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">The servant who had been given two bags of money came and said to his master, "Sir,  you gave me two bags of money. I have made two bags more money."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">His master said, "You have done well. You are a good servant. I can trust you. You have taken good care of a few things. I will put you in charge of many things. Come, have a good time with your master."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">The servant who had been given one bag of money came and said, "Sir, I knew that you were a hard man. You cut grain where you did not plant. You pick fruit where you put nothing in.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">I was afraid. So I went and hid your money in the ground. Here is your money."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">His master answered him, "You are a bad and lazy servant. You knew that I cut grain where I did not plant. You knew that I pick fruit where I put nothing in.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">You should have put my money in the bank. Then when I came home, I would have had my money with interest on it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">So take the money away from him. Give it to the one who has ten bags.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Anyone who has some will get more, and he will have plenty. But he who does not get anything, even the little that he has will be taken away from him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Take this good-for-nothing servant! Put him out in the dark place outside. People there will cry and make a noise with their teeth."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">The Son of Man will be great and will come with all his holy angels. Then he will sit on his throne like a king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">All the nations will be gathered in front of him. He will put them in two groups like a man who takes care of sheep. He puts the sheep on one side of him and he puts the goats on the other side of him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">The Son of Man will put people who are like the sheep at his right side. He will put people who are like the goats at his left side.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Then the King will say to those who are at his right side, "Come! My Father has blessed you. The kingdom was made ready for you when the world was first made. Come into it now.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">I was hungry. You gave me food. I was thirsty. You gave me a drink. I was a stranger.  You took me in.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">I needed clothes. You gave me clothes. I was sick. You came to visit me. I was in prison.  You came to see me."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">Then the good people will ask him, "Lord when did we see you hungry and give you food? When did we see you thirsty and give you a drink?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">When did we see you a stranger and take you in? When did we see you needing clothes and give you clothes?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">When did we see you sick or in prison and come to see you?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">The King will answer them, "I tell you the truth. What you did for even the smallest of these people you did for me. They are my brothers."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">Then he will say to those at the left side "Go away from me. You are cursed. Go into the fire that burns for ever. That fire has been made ready for the devil and his angels.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">I was hungry. You did not give me food. I was thirsty. You did not give me a drink.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">I was a stranger. You did not take me in. I needed clothes. You did not give me any clothes. I was sick and in prison. You did not come to see me."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">Then they will also ask, "Lord, when did we see you hungry, or thirsty, or a stranger, or needing clothes, or sick, or in prison, and did not help you?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">Then the King will answer them, "I tell you the truth. What you did not do for even the smallest of these, you did not do for me."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">And they will go away to be punished for ever. But the good people will go away to live for ever.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="26">
      <VERS vnumber="1">When Jesus had finished telling all these things, he talked to his disciples.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">He said, You know that after two days it will be time for the Passover Feast. The Son of Man will be given over to his enemies to be nailed to a cross.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Then at that time the chief priests and the leaders of the people met together in the house of the high priest. His name was Caiaphas.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">They planned how to catch Jesus by some trick and have him killed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">But they said, Let us not do it on the day of the feast. We do not want the people to start fighting about it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">When Jesus was in the town of Bethany, he was in the house of Simon, a man who had leprosy, a bad skin disease.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">While Jesus sat at the table, a woman came to him. She had a bottle of oil. It smelled very nice and cost much money. She put the oil on Jesus head.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">When the disciples saw this, they were angry. They said, Why was the oil wasted like that?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">The oil might have been sold for much money. Then the money could have been given to poor people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">When Jesus heard it, he said to them, Why do you trouble the woman? She has done a good thing to me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">You will always have poor people with you. But I will not always be with you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">She has put oil on my body to make me ready to be buried.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">I tell you the truth. Any place in the whole world where people tell the good news, people will also tell what she has done. People will remember her because of it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Then Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve disciples, went to the chief priests.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">He said, What will you give me if I help you catch Jesus? They gave him thirty pieces of silver money.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And from then on, Judas watched for a good way to help them catch Jesus. Supper</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">It was the first day of the feast with bread that has no yeast in it. The disciples came to Jesus and asked, Where do you want us to make ready for you to eat the Passover Feast?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">He said, Go into the city to a certain man. Say to him, "The Teacher says, My time is near. I will come to your house with my disciples to eat the Passover Feast."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">The disciples did what Jesus told them. They made the Passover food ready.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">When evening came, Jesus sat down to eat with the twelve disciples.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">As they were eating, Jesus said, I tell you the truth. One of you will give me over to people who hate me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">They were very sad and troubled. One after the other they began to say to him, Lord, is it I?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Jesus answered them, The man who is putting his hand in the dish with me is the one who will give me over.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">The Son of Man will go away just as the holy writings tell about him. But the man who gives him over will have trouble. It would have been better for that man if he had not been born!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Judas was the one who would give Jesus over to the people who hated him. He said,  Master, is it I? Jesus said, Yes, it is.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">As they were eating, Jesus took some bread. He thanked God for it and broke it. He gave it to the disciples and said, Take this bread and eat it. It is my body.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">He also took a cup. He thanked God for it. Then he gave it to the disciples and said, All of you drink from this.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">This is my blood. My blood is the blood of the new agreement. It is given so that many people will be forgiven for the wrong things they did.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">I tell you this. I will not drink any of the juice of the fruit of the vine again, until I drink some of it new with you in my Fathers kingdom.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">They sang a song and then went out to the hill called the Mount of Olives.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Then Jesus said to them, All of you will leave me this night. The holy writings say, "I will kill the one who takes care of the sheep. And the sheep will run away."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">But after I am raised from death, I will go to Galilee to meet you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">Peter said, Even if all the others leave you, I will never leave you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Jesus said, I tell you the truth. This night, before the cock calls, you will say three times that you do not know me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">Peter said, Even if I must die with you, I will never say I do not know you! All the disciples said the same thing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">Then Jesus came to a place called Gethsemane. He said to his disciples, Sit down here. I will go over there and talk with God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">He took Peter and Zebedees two sons with him. Jesus began to be sad and troubled.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">He said to them, My heart is very sad. I am almost dying! Stay here and watch with me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">Jesus went on a little further. He bowed down with his face to the ground. He talked to God and said, My Father, if it can be, let this cup of trouble pass by me. But do not do what I want. May what you want be done.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">Jesus went back to the disciples and found them sleeping. He said to Peter, What? Could you not watch with me for one hour?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">Watch and talk with God, so that you will not do wrong. A persons heart can want to do it, but his body is weak.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">Jesus went away again. He talked to God and said, My Father, if you do not want this cup to pass by me, but you want me to drink it, I will do what you want.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">Jesus went back again and found the disciples sleeping. They could not keep their eyes open.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">He left them and went away again. He talked with God the third time and said the same words.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">Then he went back to his disciples and said to them, Are you still sleeping and resting?  The time has come now. The Son of Man is given over to bad people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">Get up. Let us go. Look, here comes the one who will give me over to people who hate me!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">As Jesus was saying this, Judas came. He was one of the twelve disciples. Many people came with him. They had long knives or swords and big sticks. The chief priests and the leaders of the people had sent them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">The man who was going to help them catch Jesus had told them that he would give them a sign. He said, The man that I kiss is the one. Catch him and hold him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">Right then he went to Jesus and said, Greetings, Master! And he kissed him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">Jesus said to him, Friend, why have you come? Then the men came and caught Jesus and held him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="51">One of the men who was with Jesus took his sword in his hand. He hit the servant of the high priest and cut off his ear.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="52">Then Jesus said to him, Put your sword back in its place. All people who fight with a sword will be killed by a sword.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="53">Do you think that I cannot talk to my Father, and he would send me right now more than twelve armies of angels?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="54">But then, how would Gods word come true? The holy writings say that this is the way it must be.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="55">At that same time Jesus said to the people, Have you come to take me with swords and sticks as you would a man who steals? Every day I sat with you in the temple and taught.  But you did not try to catch me then.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="56">All this happened so that what the prophets said in the holy writings would come true.  Then all the disciples left Jesus and ran away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="57">The men who caught Jesus took him to Caiaphas, the high priest. The scribes and the leaders had met at his house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="58">Peter followed Jesus a long way behind. He went as far as the yard of the high priests house. He sat down with the people who worked for the high priest. He wanted to see how this would end.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="59">The chief priests and all the judges of the court tried to find men to say Jesus had done something wrong so they could kill him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="60">But they found nothing. Many people came and said things that were not true. At last two men came.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="61">They said, This man said, "I can break down Gods temple and build it again in three days."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="62">The high priest stood up. He said to Jesus, Have you no answer? What do you have to say about this? They have said something against you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="63">But Jesus said nothing at all. Then the high priest said to him, I ask you in the name of the living God. Tell us. Are you the Christ, the Son of God?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="64">Jesus answered him, Yes, I am. Also I tell you that after this you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the One who has all power. You will see him coming on the clouds in the sky!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="65">Then the high priest tore his clothes and said, What he has said is wrong! We do not need any more proof against him. You have heard the wrong thing he said.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="66">What do you think? They said, He should be killed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="67">Then they spat on Jesus face and hit him. Others slapped him with their hands.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="68">They said, Christ, tell us, if you know who hit you!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="69">Peter sat out in the yard. A servant girl came to him and said, You were also with Jesus of Galilee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="70">But Peter said in front of them all, I do not know what you are talking about.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="71">Peter went out to the gate. There, another servant-girl saw him. She said to the others around there, This man was also with Jesus of Nazareth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="72">Peter said some bad words and then said, I do not know the man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="73">A little later, those standing around came to Peter and said, Surely you are one of them also. We know it by the way you talk.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="74">Then Peter began to say even more bad words. He said, I do not know the man! Right then, a cock called.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="75">Then Peter remembered that Jesus had said, Before the cock calls, you will say three times that you do not know me. Then Peter went out and cried very much.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="27">
      <VERS vnumber="1">When it was morning, all the chief priests and the leaders of the people made a plan against Jesus. They wanted to kill him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">They tied him and took him away. They took him to Pilate, the ruler.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Judas was the man who helped them take Jesus. He saw that they had judged Jesus and were going to kill him. He was sorry for what he had done, so he brought the thirty pieces of silver money back to the chief priests and leaders.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">He said, I have done wrong. I have helped you take a good man who should not be killed. They said, What do we care? You look after that!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Judas threw the silver money into the temple. He went away and hanged himself.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">The chief priests took the money. They said, It is not right to put this money in the money box of the temple. It has been used to buy a mans death.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">They talked the matter over and bought a field that belonged to a man who made pots.  They bought it for a place in which to bury strangers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">That is why that field has been called The field of blood until now.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">What Jeremiah the prophet said long ago, then came true at that time. He said, They took thirty pieces of silver money. That is what the people of Israel said he was worth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">They paid for the potters field. That is what the Lord told me to do.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Jesus stood before the ruler. The ruler asked him, Are you the King of the Jews? Jesus said, Yes, I am.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">When the chief priests and leaders brought their complaints, Jesus said nothing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Then Pilate said to him, Do you not hear what these people say against you?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">But Jesus did not answer him, not even one word. Pilate was very much surprised about this.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">At the feast Pilate used to let one prisoner free. He let the people choose the man they wanted to go free.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">In the prison at that time was a very bad man named Barabbas.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">So while the people were there Pilate asked them, Which one do you want me to let free for you, Barabbas or Jesus who is called Christ?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Pilate knew that the chief priests did not like Jesus. He knew that was why they had brought Jesus to him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">While Pilate was sitting in the court to judge the case, his wife sent a message to him. She said, Do nothing to that good man. I have been troubled very much in a dream about him today.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">The chief priests and leaders talked to the people. They told them to ask Pilate to let Barabbas go free, but to kill Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">The ruler said to the people, Which of these two do you want me to let go free for you?  They said, Barabbas.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Pilate said to them, Then what shall I do with Jesus, who is called Christ? They all said,  Nail him to a cross!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">The ruler said, What wrong thing has he done? But they shouted even more, Nail him to a cross!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Pilate saw that he was not doing any good. And the people were making a lot of loud noise. So he washed his hands in water in front of the people. Then he said, I will not say this man must be killed. You must do that.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Then all the people answered, We and our children will do that.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Then Pilate let Barabbas go free. He told the soldiers to beat Jesus and nail him to a cross.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Then Pilates soldiers took Jesus to a room. They called all the soldiers together.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">They took off his clothes, and they put a red gown on him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">They made a big ring of thorns like a crown and put it on his head. They put a stick in his right hand. Then they kneeled down in front of him and made fun of him. They shouted,  Greetings, King of the Jews!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">They spat on him. And they took the stick and hit him on the head with it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">After they had made fun of him, they took off the red gown. They put his own clothes on him. Then they took him away to nail him to a cross.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">As they were going, they met a man named Simon. He was born in the country of Cyrene. They made him carry Jesus cross.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">They came to a place called Golgotha. That means, The place of a head bone.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">They wanted Jesus to drink wine mixed with something bitter. Jesus tasted it but he would not drink it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">Then they nailed him to a cross. They gambled to see how they should divide Jesus  clothes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">Then the soldiers sat down on the ground and watched him there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">They put the complaint against Jesus above his head. These words were written there:  This is Jesus the King of the Jews.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">Two bad men were also nailed to crosses. They had stolen money. One man was put on the right side of Jesus and one was put on the left side of him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">The people who passed by said bad things about him. They shook their heads.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">They said, You are the man who said you could break down the temple and build it again in three days. Save yourself! If you are really Gods Son, come down from the cross.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">The chief priests, the scribes, and the leaders also made fun of him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">They said, He saved other people but he cannot save himself! If he is the King of the people of Israel, he should come down from the cross now. Then we will believe in him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">He trusted in God. If God wants him, he can save him now. He said, "I am Gods Son."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">The bad men who were also nailed to crosses with him said the same things to him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">About midday, the whole land became dark and stayed dark for three hours.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">About three oclock, Jesus called out loud, Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani? That means, My God, my God, why have you left me alone?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">Some of the people standing there heard what Jesus said. They said This man is calling for Elijah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">Right away, one of them ran to get something called a sponge. He made it wet with sour wine and put it on the end of a stick. With it he gave Jesus a drink.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">The other people said, Wait. We will see if Elijah will come and save him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">Jesus called out loud again. Then he died.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="51">At that time the thick cloth that hung in the temple was torn into two pieces. It was torn from the top down to the bottom. The earth shook and big rocks broke.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="52">The graves opened. Many of Gods people who had died rose from death.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="53">They came out of their graves after Jesus rose from death. They went into Jerusalem.  Many people saw them there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="54">The Roman captain and some of his soldiers were guarding Jesus on the cross. When they saw the earth shake and the other things happen, they were very much afraid. They said, Surely this man was Gods Son.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="55">Many women were there watching from far away. They had come with Jesus from Galilee and had helped him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="56">Among these women were Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James and Joseph, and the mother of Zebedees sons.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="57">In the evening, a rich man came. He was Joseph from the town of Arimathea. He also believed in Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="58">He went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus. Pilate said that it should be given to him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="59">Joseph took the body and wrapped a clean linen cloth around it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="60">He put the body in his own new grave which had been cut in a rock. He rolled a very big stone to close the grave. Then he went away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="61">Mary Magdalene and the other Mary were there. They sat where they could see the grave.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="62">The next day was the Sabbath day. The chief priests and Pharisees went to Pilate together.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="63">They said, Sir, that man fooled people. We remember what he said when he was still living. He said that he would rise after three days.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="64">So give orders that the grave must be guarded for three days. Then his disciples cannot come in the night to carry away his body, and tell people he rose from death. This last trick would be worse than the first.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="65">Pilate said to them, Take soldiers. Go and guard the grave as well as you can.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="66">So they went and shut the grave tight. They put a government mark on the big stone. And the soldiers stayed to guard it. This was to make sure the grave would stay shut.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="28">
      <VERS vnumber="1">The Sabbath day was past. Morning light was beginning to shine on the first day of the week. Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went to see the grave.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">The earth shook very much because an angel of the Lord came down from heaven. He came and rolled the big stone away from the grave and sat on it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">His face shone like lightning. His clothes were as white as snow.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">The soldiers who were guarding the grave saw him and shook with fear. They fell down like dead men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">The angel talked to the women. He said, Do not fear. I know you are looking for Jesus,  who was nailed to a cross.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">He is not here. He has risen, as he said. Come and see the place where he lay.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Go quickly and tell his disciples, "He has risen from death. He is going to Galilee before you. You will see him there." Now, I have told you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">The women went quickly away. They left the grave with fear and they were very happy.  They ran to tell his disciples.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">As they were going, Jesus met them. He said Greetings! The women bowed down in front of him and put their hands on his feet.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="13">They said, Tell the people, "His disciples came by night and took away the body while we were sleeping."</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">This is the beginning of the good news about Jesus Christ, Gods Son.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">The men of God, called prophets, long ago wrote about it this way: God said, See, I send my man ahead of you to tell about you. He will make the way ready for you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">A man is calling out in the desert, "Make the way ready for the Lord. Make the road straight for him."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">John baptised people in the desert. He told them to stop doing wrong things and be baptised, and God would forgive them for the wrong things they did.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">People from all the land of Judea and all the city of Jerusalem went out to John. He baptised them in the Jordan River when they told about the wrong things they did.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">John wore clothes made of camels hair and a leather belt. He ate locusts and wild honey.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">He told the people, Another person is coming. He is greater than I am. I am not good enough to bend down and untie his shoe strings.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">I have baptised you with water, but he will baptise you with the Holy Spirit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">At that time Jesus came from the town of Nazareth in the country of Galilee. John baptised him in the Jordan River.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">As soon as he came up out of the water, Jesus saw the sky open. He saw Gods Holy Spirit come down on him like a bird called a dove.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">A voice from the sky said, You are my dear Son. I am very pleased with you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Right away, the Spirit made Jesus go into the desert.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Jesus was in the desert for forty days. All that time Satan tried to make Jesus do wrong.  Jesus was with wild animals. Angels came and took care of him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">John was put in prison. Then Jesus went to Galilee. He told people the good news of Gods kingdom.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">The time has come, he said. The kingdom of God is here. Stop your wrong ways, turn back to God and believe the good news.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Jesus was walking by the Sea of Galilee. There he saw Simon and his brother Andrew.  They were throwing a fishing net into the water. Their work was to catch fish.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Jesus said to them, Come with me. The work I give you will be to catch people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Right away they left their nets and went with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Jesus went on from there and saw James and his brother John. Their fathers name was Zebedee. They were in a boat mending their nets.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Jesus called them. Right away they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the workmen and went with Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">They went to the town of Capernaum. As soon as it was the Sabbath day, Jesus went into their meeting house and taught the people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">They were very much surprised at his teaching because he taught them as if he had the right to teach them. He did not teach them like their teachers called scribes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">A man who had a bad spirit in him was in the meeting house at that time.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">He called out, Jesus of Nazareth, what do you want to do to us? Have you come to kill us? I know who you are. You are the Holy One of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Jesus said to the spirit, Be quiet! Come out of him!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">The bad spirit threw the man around. It called out loud and then it came out of the man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">The people were all surprised. They said one to another, What is this? Is not this a new teaching? He tells the bad spirits what to do and even they obey him</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">The people all around Galilee heard right away about Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">As soon as they came out of the meeting house, they went to the home of Simon and Andrew. James and John went also.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Simons wifes mother was sick and was lying down. She had a fever. Right away they told Jesus about her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Jesus went to her. He took her hand and helped her up. The fever left her right away,  and she began to do things to help them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">That evening when the sun went down, people brought to Jesus all the sick people and those who had bad spirits.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">All the people in the city crowded around the door.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">He healed many sick people. He drove the bad spirits out of people. And he did not let them speak because they knew who he was.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">The next morning Jesus got up long before daylight. He went out to a place by himself.  There he talked with God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">Simon and his friends went out after Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">When they found him they said, Everyone is looking for you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">Jesus said, We must go to the next towns. I must tell the good news to the people there too. That is why I came here.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">Then Jesus talked to the people in all the meeting houses in all the country of Galilee. He also made the bad spirits come out of people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">A man who was sick with leprosy &lt;FI&gt;a bad skin disease&lt;Fi&gt; came to him. He kneeled down and begged Jesus saying, I know you can heal me if you want to.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">Jesus was very sorry for him. He put out his hand and touched him. He said, I want to.  Be healed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">As soon as he said this, the disease left the man and he was healed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">Jesus talked strongly to him and sent him away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">He said, Do not tell anyone about this. But go and let the priest look at you. Moses gave a law about the gift you must give to God when you are healed. Give it to prove to people that you are healed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">But the man went out and told everyone everywhere what had happened to him. Because he did this, Jesus could not go into any large town freely. He stayed in places where only a few people were. There people came to him from everywhere.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="2">
      <VERS vnumber="1">After a few days he came back to Capernaum. People soon heard that he was at home.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Many came together right away. The house was full. There was no more room, not even outside near the door. Jesus was telling them Gods message.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Four men brought a sick man to Jesus. The man could not move his arms or legs.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">But they could not get in the house where Jesus was, because there were so many people. So they went up on the roof. They made a hole in the roof. Then they let down the mat with the sick man on it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Jesus saw that they believed he would be healed. So he said to the sick man, Son, the wrong things you have done are forgiven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Some of the scribes were sitting there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">They were thinking, Why does this man say such wrong things against God? He is not giving God respect! Who can forgive the wrong things people do? No one but God can do that.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Jesus understood in his spirit what the scribes were thinking. He said right away, Why do you think these wrong things in your hearts?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Which is easier, to say to the sick man, "The wrong things you have done are forgiven,"  or to say, "Get up. Take up your mat and walk"?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">I want you to know that the Son of Man has power on earth to forgive the wrong things people do. So he said to the sick man,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">I tell you, get up! Take up your mat and go home.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Right away the man stood up in front of them. He took up his mat and went home. They were all very much surprised, and they praised God. They said, We have never seen anything like this before.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Jesus went out again by the seaside. Many people came to him. So he taught them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">As he went along, he saw Levi, the son of Alphaeus. He was sitting at the place where people come to pay taxes. Jesus said to him, Come with me. Levi stood up and went with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Jesus was eating in Levis house. Many tax collectors and bad people also came. They sat down to eat with Jesus and his disciples. There were many who went with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">The scribes and Pharisees saw that Jesus ate with these people. They said to the disciples, Why does he eat and drink with bad people?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Jesus heard it. He said to them, People who are well do not need a doctor. But sick people need him. I did not come to call good people. I came to call bad people to stop doing wrong things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Johns disciples and the Pharisees disciples were fasting &lt;FI&gt;not eating food for a time&lt;Fi&gt; .  Some people came to Jesus and said, The disciples of John and of the Pharisees fast.  Why do your disciples not do the same?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Jesus answered them, The people at a wedding cannot be sad while the man who is married is with them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">But the time will come when he will be taken away from them. Then they will fast.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">No person sews a piece of new cloth on an old coat. If he does, the new cloth will tear the old coat. Then the hole is bigger than it was before.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">No person puts new wine into old wine skins. If he does, the new wine will break the skins. Then the wine will be lost and the skins will be spoiled. New wine is put into new skins.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Jesus was walking through the grainfields on the Sabbath day. His disciples began to pick some of the seed (to eat) as they went along.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">The Pharisees said to Jesus, Why do your disciples do what is not right on the Sabbath day?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Jesus answered them, Have you not read what David did? He and his men who were with him were hungry.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">He went into Gods house when Abiathar was the high priest. Some bread was there for God. It was not right for them to eat it. Only the priests have the right to eat it. But David took the bread and ate it. He also gave some of it to the people who were with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Jesus went on to say, The Sabbath was made for the good of man. Man was not made for the Sabbath.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">So the Son of Man rules over the Sabbath day.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="3">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Jesus went into the meeting house again. A man was there whose right hand was thin and weak.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">The Pharisees watched Jesus to see if he would heal the man on the Sabbath day. They wanted to find something wrong about Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">He spoke to the man whose hand was thin and weak. He said, Stand here.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Then he spoke to the Pharisees. He said, Is it right to do good things on the Sabbath day or to do wrong things? Is it right to heal people so they will live, or to let them die? But the Pharisees said nothing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Jesus was angry as he looked at them. And he was sad that their hearts were so hard.  Then he said to the man, Hold out your hand. The man did so, and it was made well like the other hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">The Pharisees went out. Right away they and the servants of King Herod planned together how to kill Jesus.</VERS>

They came from Galilee, Judea, Jerusalem, Idumea, and from the other side of the Jordan River. And many more people came also, a great many from around the cities of Tyre and Sidon. They also had heard about the great works that Jesus had done.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Jesus saw that the crowd was very big. He told the disciples to have a small boat ready for him so that he would have more room.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">He did this because he healed many people. All who were sick tried to touch him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">When the bad spirits saw Jesus, they bowed down before him. They shouted, You are Gods Son!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">He told them they must not tell anyone who he was.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Then Jesus went up on the hill. He wanted some of the people to come with him. So he called them and they came.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">He chose twelve disciples to stay with him. He wanted to send them out to other places to tell people Gods word.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">He gave them power to heal people and to drive bad spirits out of people.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="21">When Jesus family heard about this, they came to take him away. They said, He is crazy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">The scribes who came from Jerusalem also talked about Jesus. They said, Beelzebub,  the chief of bad spirits, is in this man. He drives out bad spirits by the help of Beelzebub.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Jesus called the people and talked to them in stories. He asked, How can Satan drive out Satan?</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="25">If one part of a family fights against the other part of the family, it cannot stand.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="28">I tell you the truth. All wrong things that people do and say about anyone will be forgiven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">But people who say wrong things against the Holy Spirit will never be forgiven. A person who does that will be punished for ever.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Jesus said all this because the scribes said, A bad spirit is in him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Jesus mother and brothers came to him. They stood outside. They sent someone to him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">Many people were sitting around him. They said, See, your mother and your brothers are outside. They want you.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Jesus began to teach people by the sea again. Many people came to him. So he got in a boat on the sea and sat down. The people were by the sea on the land.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">He told the people stories and taught them many things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">He said, Listen. A man went out to sow some seed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">As he sowed it, some of the seed fell on the road. Birds came and ate the seed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Some seed fell on the stony ground. Not much ground covered the stones. The seed started to grow right away because it was not deep in the ground.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">When the sun began to shine, it was too hot for the new plants. They died because they had no roots.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Some seed fell among the weeds. The weeds grew up and made the new plants die. So no seeds grew on them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">But some seed fell on good ground. That seed grew and the plants gave more seed. Some plants gave thirty seeds. Some gave sixty. And some gave a hundred.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Jesus said to them, Everyone who has ears to hear, listen!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Later, Jesus was alone. Then the twelve disciples and the other people who were there asked him about the stories.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">He said to them, You can learn the secret things about the kingdom of God. But we must use stories to tell the other people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">They may look and look, but they will not see. They may listen and listen, but they will not understand. If they did understand, they would turn back to God and he would forgive them for the wrong things they have done.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Jesus said also, Do you not understand this story? How then are you going to understand all the stories?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">The man who sows the seed tells Gods message.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Those beside the road are like people who hear the message. But as soon as they hear it,  Satan comes and takes it out of their hearts</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">The seed that fell on the stony ground is the same. It is like people who hear the message and as soon as they hear it they are very glad.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">They believe it for a short time. When trouble or a hard time comes because of the message, they stop believing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">The seed that fell among the weeds is like people who hear the message.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">But they think about the things of this world. They want to get money and other things to be happy. These things push the message out of their hearts. No good comes from it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">But some seed fell on good ground. That is like people who hear the message and understand it. Much good comes from it. Some people are like the seed that made thirty seeds. Some people are like the seed that gave sixty. Some people are like the seed that gave a hundred.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Then Jesus said to them, People do not bring a light and put it under a basket or under a bed. But they put it on the place for a lamp.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Everything that is hidden will be seen. Everything that is secret will be known and come out to be seen.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Everyone who has ears to hear, listen!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And Jesus said, Take care how you listen. How much you give to others is how much will be given to you. You who obey God will get more than you give.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Anyone who has some will get more. But he who does not have anything, even the little that he has will be taken away from him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And Jesus said, The kingdom of God is like this. A man sows some seed in the ground.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Then he goes on just as he did before. He sleeps at night and wakes up in the morning.  The seed begins to grow but he doesnt know what makes it grow.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">The ground itself makes the seed grow. First the plant comes up. Then it begins to have seed of its own. After a while the harvest is ready.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">When the harvest is really ready, he cuts it right away because the harvest time has come.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And Jesus said, What is the kingdom of God like? What shall I say it is like?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">It is like this. A mustard seed is the smallest seed that is ever planted in the earth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">But the plant that grows from that seed is bigger than any other plant. It puts out very big branches. The birds come and live in its branches.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">Jesus told the people many stories like this. He told them as much of Gods words as they were able to understand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">He did not tell them anything without a story. When he was alone with his disciples, he told them the meaning of the stories.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="38">Jesus was in the back end of the boat, sleeping with his head on a pillow. The disciples woke him up. Master, they shouted. We will die! Do you not care?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">Then Jesus got up. He said to the wind and the sea, Stop! The wind stopped. Then all was quiet.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">Then he said to the disciples, Why do you fear? Do you not believe in God?</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="5">
      <VERS vnumber="1">They came to the other side of the sea, to the country of the Gadarene people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">There were graves in that place. As soon as Jesus came out of the boat, a man came from among the graves to meet him. The man had a bad spirit in him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">The man lived among the graves. No person could tie him, not even with chains.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Many times people had tied him with strong ropes and chains. But he broke the chains and tore the ropes into many pieces. No person was strong enough to hold the man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">All the time he stayed in the hills where the graves were. He screamed day and night and cut himself with sharp stones.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Jesus was still far from him, but when he saw Jesus he ran to him. He kneeled down in front of Jesus and worshipped him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">He called out loud, Jesus, Son of the High God, what are you going to do to me? I beg you not to hurt me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">He said this because Jesus had said to him, You bad spirit, come out of the man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Jesus asked, What is your name? He answered, My name is An Army, for we are many.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">He begged Jesus saying, Do not send us out of the country.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Many pigs were feeding on the hill there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">The bad spirits begged Jesus saying, Send us to the pigs so that we can go into them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Jesus let them go right away. The bad spirits came out of the man and went into the pigs.  The pigs ran fast down the steep hill into the sea. They died in the water. The number of pigs was about two thousand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Then the men who cared for the pigs ran away. They told the people in the city and all around the country about it. The people went out to see what had happened.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">They came to Jesus. They saw the man who had the many bad spirits in him. He was sitting with clothes on and was not crazy any more. The people were afraid.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Those who had seen it told them what had happened to the man who used to have many bad spirits. And they told about the pigs.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Then the people began to beg Jesus to go away out of their country.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">So Jesus got into the boat again. The man who used to have the bad spirits in him begged to go with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">But Jesus did not let him. He said, Go home. Tell your friends what the Lord has done for you. Tell them that he has helped you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">So the man went away and told people in the Ten Towns what Jesus had done for him.  All the people were surprised.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Jesus crossed over the sea again to the other side. Many people came to him while he was near the water.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">One of the rulers of the meeting house came to him. His name was Jairus. When he saw Jesus, he kneeled down before him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">He said, My little daughter is dying. I beg you, come and put your hands on her so that she will be healed and live.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">So Jesus went with Jairus. Many people went with Jesus and pushed against him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">A woman among them had a sickness for twelve years. She was bleeding all the time.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Many doctors tried to heal her. She spent all the money she had to pay them. She was not better, but was getting worse.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">When she heard of Jesus, she came among the people behind him. Then she reached out and touched his clothes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">She said to herself, If only I touch his clothes, I will be well.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">The bleeding stopped right away. She could feel that she was healed of her trouble.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Jesus knew right away that power to heal went out from him. He turned around among the people and said, Who touched my clothes?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">But his disciples said to him, You see all these people pushing around you. Why do you ask, "Who touched me?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">He looked around to see who had done it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">The woman was afraid and trembled. She knew what had happened to her. She kneeled down in front of Jesus and told him the truth about herself.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">He said to her, Daughter, you were healed because you believed. Go and do not be troubled. You are healed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">While Jesus was still talking, some people came from the rulers house. They said, Your daughter has died. Why trouble the Teacher any more?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">Jesus heard it. He said to the ruler, Do not fear. Only believe.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">Jesus did not let anyone go with him only Peter, James, and his brother John.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">They came to the rulers house. Jesus saw that there was trouble. People were crying and making much noise because the rulers daughter had died.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">When he came into the house, he said to them, Why do you make so much noise and cry? The girl is not dead, but is sleeping.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">They laughed at him. So he sent them all outside. Then he took the girls father and mother and the three disciples into the room where the girl was lying.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">He took her hand and said, Talitha cumi! That means, Little girl, I tell you, get up!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">The girl got up right away and walked around. She was twelve years old. The people were very much surprised.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">Jesus said, Do not tell anyone about this. Give the girl something to eat.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="6">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Jesus left that place and went back to his home town. His disciples went with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">On the Sabbath day he began to teach in the meeting house again. Many people who heard him were very much surprised and said, Where did he learn all this? Where did he get the power to do these big works?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Is he not the carpenter? Is not Mary his mother? Are not James, Joseph, Judas, and Simon his brothers? Are not his sisters here with us? The people did not understand Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Jesus said to them, Other people honour a man who is a prophet of God. But the people in his own country, his own home, and his family, do not honour him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Jesus could not do any big works in that place. But he put his hands on a few sick people and healed them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">He was surprised that the people did not believe him. He went out to the villages,  teaching the people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">He called the twelve disciples to him and sent them out two by two. He gave them power to drive bad spirits out of people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">He said, Take only a walking stick with you when you go. Do not take anything else. Do not take any food, or a bag, or money.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Wear shoes, but do not take extra clothing with you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">When you go into a certain house, live there until you leave the town.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">In some places the people will not take you in. They will not listen to what you say.  When you leave such a town, shake the dust off your feet. That will be a warning to them. I tell you the truth. On the day when people are judged, the people in that town will be punished harder than the people in the country of Sodom and Gomorrah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">The disciples went out and told the people that they should stop doing wrong things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">They drove bad spirits out of many people. They also put oil on many sick people and healed them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">King Herod heard about these things. People were talking about Jesus everywhere.  Herod said, John the Baptizer is risen from death. That is why he is able to do such great works.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Other people said, It is Elijah. Others said, He is a prophet like the prophets of God who lived long ago.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Herod heard what other people said, so he said, I cut off Johns head. He is alive again.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Herod had sent his people to catch John. They tied him and put him in prison to please Herodias. Herod had married her, but she was his brother Philips wife.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">John had told Herod, It is wrong for you to have your brothers wife.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">, fehlt/missing</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">So Herodias hated John. She wanted to kill him. But she could not because Herod liked John. He knew that John did what was right and was a good man. So he kept John safe.  When he heard John speak he was troubled in his heart, and yet he was glad to hear him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">rod made a feast on his birthday. He called all his rulers and the captains and the leaders of Galilee to come to the feast.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">The daughter of Herodias came in and danced for them. This pleased Herod and the people at the feast. Then the king said to the girl, Ask me for anything you want and I will give it to you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">He made a promise which he would not break. He said, Anything that you ask me for I will give you, even if you ask me for half of my kingdom.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">The girl went to her mother and said, What shall I ask for? Her mother said, Ask for the head of John the Baptizer.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">The girl came quickly to the king and said, I want you to give me the head of John the Baptizer on a plate. Give it to me right away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">The king was very sorry. But he had made a promise and all the people at the feast had heard him promise. He wanted to do what he promised her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Right away he sent one of the soldiers who was standing on guard. He told him to bring Johns head. The soldier went to the prison and cut off Johns head.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">He brought the head on a plate and gave it to the girl. She gave it to her mother.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">When Johns disciples heard of it, they came and took his body and buried it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">The apostles came back to Jesus. They told him all they had done and taught.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Jesus said to them, Come away with me. Let us go alone to a quiet place and rest for a while. Many people were coming and going. They could not even eat.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">So they went away in a boat to a lonely place by themselves.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">The people saw them going. Many people knew them. The people ran from all the towns and got there ahead of them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">When the boat got there, Jesus saw the many people. He was very sorry for them because they were like sheep with no one to care for them. He began to teach them many things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">When it was late in the day, his disciples came to him. They said, This is a lonely place and the time is late.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">Send these people away to farms and villages to buy food for themselves. They have nothing to eat.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">Jesus said, You give them food to eat. They said, Shall we go and buy a lot of bread and give them to eat?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">He said, Go and see how much bread you have. When they knew, they told him, We have five loaves of bread and two fish.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">Jesus told the disciples to make all the people sit on the green grass in groups.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">The people sat down in groups. Some groups were a hundred people and some were fifty people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">Jesus took the five loaves of bread and the two fish. He looked up to heaven and thanked God for them. Then he broke them in pieces. He gave them to the disciples to give to the people. Then he divided the two fish among them all.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">They all ate and had enough.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">Then they gathered twelve baskets full of pieces that were left.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">The number of men who ate was about five thousand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">Then Jesus said to the disciples, You get into the boat right away and go over to Bethsaida. I will send the people away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">When he had sent the people away, he went up on the hill to talk with God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">In the evening the boat was far out on the water. Jesus was alone on the land.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">He saw the disciples working hard rowing the boat. The wind was blowing the wrong way. When it was almost morning, Jesus came to the disciples. He was walking on the water. He was going to pass by them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">But when they saw him walking on the water, they thought it was a spirit. They shouted loudly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">They all saw him and were very much afraid. He spoke to them right away. He said, Be glad! It is I. Do not fear.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="51">Then he got in the boat with them. The wind stopped. They were very much surprised and did not know what to say.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="52">They did not understand the lesson about the bread because their minds were too slow.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="53">They crossed over the sea and came to the land at Gennesaret. They came to shore.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="54">As soon as he got out of the boat, the people knew him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="55">They went quickly to all the country around. They brought sick people in their beds to the place where they heard Jesus was.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="56">They laid sick people by the road in villages, towns, and farms and every place he went.  They begged him to let them touch his clothes. And all the people who touched him were healed.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="7">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Then some Pharisees and scribes from Jerusalem came to Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">They saw some of the disciples eating food. They had not washed their hands before they ate. The Pharisees said that was wrong.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">They and all the Jews keep the laws made by men. God did not give them those laws.  They do not eat until they wash their hands very well.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">When they come from the market, they do not eat until they have washed themselves.  They also keep many other laws such as washing cups, pots, brass pans, and beds.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">The Pharisees and the scribes asked Jesus, Why do your disciples not keep the law our fathers made? Why do they eat with hands that are not clean?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Jesus said to them, Isaiah spoke the truth about you people! You are not true to yourselves! He wrote about you this way: "These people respect me with their mouths.  But their hearts are far from me. They do not mean it in their hearts when they worship me. Their teachings are only words of men."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">You do not keep the law of God, but you keep the laws made by people. Those laws are about washing pots and cups. You do many other things like that also.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">You break Gods law so that you can keep your own law.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Moses said, "Respect your father and your mother. Anyone who says wrong things to his father or his mother will die."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">You say, "Tell your father or your mother that what you were going to give to them is Corban." (That means a gift to God.)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">So you stop him from doing anything for his father and mother.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">You make Gods law to mean nothing so that you can keep your own laws. You do many other things like that also.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Then Jesus called the people to him again. He said, Listen to me, all of you, and understand what I say.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">What goes into a persons mouth does not make him dirty. But what comes out of a persons mouth makes him dirty.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Everyone who has ears to hear, listen!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Jesus left the people and went into a house. His disciples asked him the meaning of the story.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">He said, Do you still not understand? Do you not know this? What goes into a person from the outside cannot make a person dirty.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">It does not go into his heart, but into his stomach, and then it goes out of the body. By saying this, Jesus meant that food does not make a person dirty.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">But he said, What comes out of a person makes him dirty. 21,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Here is what comes from the heart: wrong thoughts, all kinds of adultery, stealing, killing,  wanting things that other people have, doing very wrong things, fooling people, breaking the law, jealousy, saying wrong things about people, being proud, being foolish.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">All these wrong things come from a persons heart and make him dirty.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Then Jesus went away to the country of Tyre and Sidon. He went into a house and did not want anyone to know he was there. But he could not hide from the people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Right away a woman heard of him. She came and kneeled down before him. Her daughter had a bad spirit in her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">The woman was not a Jew and had been born in the country of Phoenicia in Syria. She begged Jesus to drive the bad spirit out of her daughter.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">But Jesus said to her, We will give the children all they want to eat first. It is not right to take the childrens food and give it to the little dogs.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">She answered, Yes, Sir. But even the little dogs under the table eat food that falls from the childrens table.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Jesus said to her, Because you have said this, you may go home. The bad spirit has gone out of your daughter.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">When she came to her house, she found that the bad spirit had left. Her daughter was lying on the bed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Jesus went away from Tyre and Sidon and came to the sea of Galilee. He passed through the country of the Ten Towns.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">The people brought a man to Jesus who could not hear and could not talk well. They begged Jesus to put his hand on him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">So Jesus took him away alone. He put his fingers in the mans ears. Then he spat and touched the mans tongue.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">He looked up to heaven and sighed. He said, Ephphatha! That means, Be opened!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Right away the mans ears were opened and his tongue was made free. He could talk well.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">Jesus said, Do not tell anyone. But the more he told them not to tell, the more they told it everywhere.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">The people were very much surprised. They said, He has done everything well. The people who could not hear can hear. The people who could not talk can talk.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="8">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Again at that time many, many people came together. They had nothing to eat. Jesus called his disciples. He said,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">I share the suffering of the people. They have been with me for three days and they have nothing to eat.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">If I send them home hungry, they will get weak and fall on the way. Some of them have come a long way.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">His disciples answered, Where can anyone get enough food in this lonely place to feed so many people?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Jesus asked them, How many loaves of bread have you? They said, Seven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">He told the people to sit down on the ground. Then he took the seven loaves of bread and thanked God for them. Then he broke the bread and gave it to the disciples. They gave it to the people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">They had a few small fish. Jesus told the disciples to divide the fish among the people also.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">The people ate and had enough. They gathered seven baskets full of pieces that were left.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">The number of men who ate was about four thousand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Jesus sent them away. Then right away he got in the boat with his disciples and went to the country around Dalmanutha.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">The Pharisees came and began to argue with Jesus. They wanted to test him. So they asked him to show them a sign from the sky.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">He sighed deeply in his spirit and said, Why do people today want a sign? I tell you the truth. No sign will be given to them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">He left them and went to the other side in a boat.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">The disciples forgot to take food. They had only one loaf of bread with them in the boat.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Jesus said, Watch! Take care. Do not let the bread yeast of the Pharisees and Herod spoil you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">The disciples talked to one another about the matter. They said, He says that because we have no bread.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Jesus knew what they were saying. He asked, Why are you saying, "We have no bread"? Do you not yet understand? Are your minds so slow?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Can you not see with your eyes or hear with your ears? Do you not remember?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">When I broke five loaves for five thousand people, how many baskets full of broken pieces did you gather? They said, Twelve.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="21">He said to them, How is it that you do not yet understand?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Then they came to Bethsaida. Some people brought a blind man to Jesus. They begged him to touch the man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Jesus took the blind man by the hand and led him out of the village. He spat on his eyes and put his hands on him. Then he asked, Do you see anything?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">The man looked up and said, I see men, but they look like trees that are walking.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Jesus put his hands on him again. He made him look up. Then he was healed and could see everybody clearly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Jesus sent the man away to his home. Do not go into the village and do not tell it to anyone, he said.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Jesus went with his disciples to the villages in Caesarea Philippi. On the way he asked his disciples, Who do people say that I am?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">They answered, People say that you are John the Baptizer. Others say that you are Elijah. And others say that you are one of the prophets from long ago.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Then he asked them, But who do you say I am? Peter answered, You are the Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Jesus said to them, Do not tell anyone about me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Then he began to teach them. He said, The Son of Man will have much trouble. The leaders, the chief priests, and the scribes will not believe him. He will be killed. After three days he will rise.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">Jesus said this very plainly. Peter took him to one side and began to tell him not to say such things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">Jesus turned around and saw the disciples. Then he talked to Peter. He said, Get away from me, Satan! You are not thinking the way God thinks, but the way people think.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Jesus called the people and the disciples to him. He said, If anyone wants to come with me he must leave what he himself wants to do. He must be ready to carry his own cross and come with me.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Jesus said to them, I tell you the truth. Some people are standing here who will not die before they see the kingdom of God come with power.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Six days after this, Jesus took Peter, James, and John with him. He led them up a hill by themselves. Jesus was changed in front of them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">His clothes were white like light. No person on earth could make them so white.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Then they saw Elijah and Moses talking with Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Then Peter said to Jesus, Master, this is a good place for us. We will make three places,  one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Peter did not know what to say because they were very much afraid.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Then a cloud came over them. A voice in the cloud said, This is my dear Son. Listen to him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">They quickly looked around but they saw no one except Jesus there with them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">When they came down the hill, Jesus said to them, Do not tell anyone what you saw. Do not tell it until after the Son of Man has been raised from death.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">So they kept these things to themselves, asking each other what he meant about rising from death.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Then they asked Jesus, Why do the scribes &lt;FI&gt;who know all about the holy writings&lt;Fi&gt; say that first Elijah must come?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">He said, Elijah does come first. He will get everything ready. But why do the holy writings say that the Son of Man must have much trouble? They say, "He will have much trouble and the people will not respect him."</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="14">When they came to the disciples, they saw many people around them. Some scribes were talking with the disciples.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">The people were all very much surprised when they saw Jesus. They ran to him and greeted him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Jesus asked his disciples, What are you talking about with them?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">One of the people said, Teacher, I brought my son to you. A bad spirit is in him so he cannot talk.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Wherever it takes hold of him, it throws him around. It makes him foam at his mouth. It makes him make noises with his teeth. He is getting weak and thin. I asked your disciples to drive the bad spirit out, but they could not do it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Jesus said, You people today do not believe. How long must I be with you? How long must I put up with you? Bring the boy here to me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">So they brought the boy to him. As soon as the bad spirit saw him, he threw the boy around. The boy fell on the ground and rolled around. Foam was coming from his mouth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Jesus asked the father, How long has he had this spirit? He answered, Since he was a child.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Often it has thrown him in the fire and in the water. It has tried to kill him. If you can do anything for him, show us that you share our suffering by helping us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Jesus said to him, You say, "If you can." Anything can be done for the person who believes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Right away the father of the child, with tears in his eyes, said loudly, I do believe! Help me to believe more!</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="28">Jesus went into the house. His disciples were alone with him. They asked him, Why could we not drive out the bad spirit?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Jesus said to them, This kind of bad spirit does not come out unless people talk to God and fast.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Then they left that place and went through Galilee. Jesus did not want anyone to know it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">He taught his disciples. He said to them, The Son of Man will be given over to men.  They will kill him. When he is killed, he will rise after three days.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="37">If anyone takes in a child like this for my sake, he takes in me. If anyone takes in me, he takes in the One who sent me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">John said to him, Master, we saw a man driving bad spirits out of people. He was using your name, but he is not one of us. So we told him to stop because he is not one of us.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="40">He that is not against us is on our side.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">I tell you the truth. If anyone gives you a cup of water to drink because you belong to Christ, he will not lose his reward</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Jesus left that place and went through the country of Judea on the other side of the Jordan river. Many people came to him there again. He taught them as he always did.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">The Pharisees came to him and asked, Is it right for a man to send his wife away from him? They asked this to test Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Jesus answered, What law did Moses give you?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">They said, Moses allowed a man to write a paper to show that he does not want her any more. Then he may send her away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Jesus said to them, Moses wrote that law because your hearts are so hard.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">From the time God first made people, he made them man and woman.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">That is why a man must leave his father and mother and stay with his wife.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">The two of them will be like one person. So they are not two people any more, but they are one person.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Man must not separate what God has joined together.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">When they were in the house, the disciples asked Jesus about this matter.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">So Jesus said, If any man sends away his wife and marries another woman, he commits adultery against her. &lt;FI&gt;He takes another woman who is not his wife.&lt;Fi&gt;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">If a woman sends away her husband and marries another man, she commits adultery.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">They brought children to Jesus. They wanted him to put his hands on them. The disciples tried to stop the people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">When Jesus saw what the disciples did, he did not like it. He said, Let the children come to me. Do not try to stop them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">I tell you the truth. If anyone does not believe in the kingdom of God like a child, he will never go in.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Jesus took the children up in his arms. He put his hands on them and blessed them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Jesus started on the way again. A man came running and kneeled down before him. He said, Good Teacher, what must I do so that I will live for ever?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Jesus said, Why do you call me good? Only God is good.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">You know the laws: "Do not commit adultery. Do not kill. Do not steal. Do not tell lies.  Do not cheat. Respect your father and your mother."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">The man answered Jesus. He said, Teacher, I have kept all those laws since I was a boy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Jesus looked at him. He loved him. He said, You need one thing more. Go home. Sell everything you have. Give the money to the poor people. You will be rich in heaven. So be ready to carry your own cross and come with me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">When the young man heard that, he was sad, because he was very rich. So he went away.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="24">The disciples were surprised at his words. But Jesus said again, Children, it is very hard for people who trust in riches to enter the kingdom of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">It is easier for a big animal to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">They were very much surprised. They said, Then who can be saved?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Jesus looked at them and said, Men cannot do it but God can, because God can do anything.</VERS>

If any man has left his house, or his brothers, or his sisters, his mother, or his father, or his children, or farms, for my sake and for the sake of the good news, he will receive his pay in this life. He will have a hundred times as many houses, and brothers, and sisters, and mothers, and children, and farms. He will have trouble also. But in the next world he will live for ever.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">But many people who are first will be last, and those who are last will be first.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">Jesus and his disciples were on the road to Jerusalem. Jesus was walking in front of them.  The disciples were surprised. And the people who came behind were afraid. He took the twelve disciples and began to tell them what was going to happen to him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">He said, We are going to Jerusalem. The Son of Man will be given over to the chief priests and the scribes. They will judge him and say he must die. They will give him over to rulers who are not Jews.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">They will make fun of him. They will spit on him. They will beat him and kill him. After three days, he will rise again.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">James and John, the sons of Zebedee, came to Jesus and said, Master, we want you to do for us anything we ask you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">Jesus said, What do you want me to do for you?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">They said, Let one of us sit at your right side and one at your left side when you rule.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">But Jesus said, You do not know what you are asking. Can you drink from the cup that I will drink from? Can you go through the big trouble that I will go through?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">Yes, they said. We can. Then Jesus said to them, You will drink what I drink and you will have trouble the way I will have.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">But I cannot choose who will sit at my right hand or at my left. It has been planned who will sit there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">When the other ten disciples heard about it, they were angry with James and John.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">Jesus called them and said, You know the people who rule over countries make their people obey them. The great will tell the others what to do.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">But that is not the way it is among you. Anyone among you who wants to be great must help the others.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">Anyone among you who wants to be first shall be a servant to the others.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">The Son of Man did not come to have others help him. But he came to help others. He came to give his life to make many people free.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">Then they came to Jericho. As Jesus and his disciples left Jericho, many people followed him. A blind man named Bartimaeus, the son of Timaeus, was sitting by the road. He was begging for money.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">He heard that Jesus of Nazareth was passing. So he shouted, Jesus, Son of David! Help me!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">Many people said, Be quiet! But he shouted louder, Son of David! Help me!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">Jesus stopped and said, Call him. They called the blind man and said to him, Be glad!  Come, get up! He is calling you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">The man threw off his coat, jumped up, and went to Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="51">Jesus said, What do you want me to do for you? The blind man said to him, Teacher, I want to see.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="52">Jesus said, Go home. Because you believe in me, your faith has made you well. Right then he was able to see. He followed Jesus on the road.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="11">
      <VERS vnumber="1">They came to Bethphage and Bethany, near Jerusalem by the hill called Olives. Then he sent two of his disciples ahead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">He said, Go into the village in front of you. As soon as you go in, you will find an animal tied. No one has ever sat on it. Untie it and bring it to me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">If anyone asks you, "Why are you doing this?" tell him, "The Lord needs it. He will send it back soon."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">The disciples went. They found the animal tied outside a door in the street. They untied it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">People standing there said, What are you doing, untying the animal?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">The disciples said what Jesus had told them to say. So they let them go.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">They brought it to Jesus and laid their coats on it. He got on it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Many people spread their coats on the road. Others cut leaves and branches from the fields and put them on the road.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">People in front of him and people behind him shouted, Praise God! God bless him who comes in the name of the Lord!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">God bless the kingdom of our father David which is coming. Praise him in heaven!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And so Jesus went into Jerusalem and into the temple. He looked at everything. Then he went out with the twelve disciples to Bethany. It was late already.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">In the morning when they were on the way out of Bethany, Jesus was hungry.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">He saw a fig tree a little way off with leaves on it. So he went to see if it had figs. He came to the tree. There was no fruit on it, only leaves. It was not the time for figs.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Jesus said to the tree, No one will ever eat a fig from you again! His disciples heard what he said.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">They reached Jerusalem. Jesus went into the temple. He began to drive out the people who were buying and selling in the temple. He threw down the tables of the money changers. He pushed down the seats of those who sold doves.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">He would not let anyone carry anything through the temple.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">He taught the people, saying, The holy writings say, "My house shall be called a house for all tribes and nations, where people talk with God." But you have made it a place for people who steal!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">The chief priests and scribes heard what he said. They wanted to find some way to kill him. They feared Jesus because all the people were surprised at his teaching.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">In the evening Jesus and his disciples went out of the city.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">The next morning they passed the fig tree again. They saw that it had died from the roots.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Peter remembered about it. He said, Look Master, you cursed the fig tree and it has died.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Jesus said, Believe in God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">I tell you the truth. Anyone may say to this hill, "Go and jump into the sea." He must not doubt in his heart, but he must believe that he will have the things he asks for and he will have them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">So I tell you, when you ask God for anything believe that you will get it and you will have it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">When you stand and talk with God, forgive others for the wrong things they have done to you. Then your Father in heaven will also forgive you for the wrong things you have done.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">But if you do not forgive others, your Father in heaven will not forgive you for the wrong things you have done.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">They came to Jerusalem again. Jesus walked in the temple. The chief priests, the scribes,  and the leaders came to him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">They said, What right have you to do these things? Who gave you the right to do them?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Jesus said, I will ask you a question. If you answer me, I will answer you and tell you what right I have to do these things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Who gave John the right to baptise people? Did God or did men? Answer me!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">So they talked it over together. They said, If we say, "God gave John the right," he will say, "Then why did you not believe him?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">But what if we say, "Men gave him the right to do it"? They feared the people because they all believed that John was a prophet of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">So they answered Jesus, We do not know. Then Jesus said, Neither will I tell you what right I have to do these things.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="12">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Jesus then began to speak to the disciples in stories. A man planted a farm of vines for growing fruit called grapes. He put a fence of small trees around it. He dug a place to press the juice from the fruit. He built a high house from which men could watch over the farm. Then he let some men pay to use it and went to a country far away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">At harvest time the owner sent one his servants to get some of the fruit from the farm.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">The men took the servant and beat him. They sent him away without any fruit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">He sent another servant. They hurt this one also, and cut his head. The things they did to him were very wrong.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">So he sent another servant. The men killed him. He sent many others, and the men beat some and killed others.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">There was one left. He was his own son. He sent him last. He said, "They will respect my son."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">But the men said to each other, "This is the one who will have everything when his father dies. Let us kill him. Then everything will belong to us."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">They killed him and threw his body outside the farm.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">What will the man who owned the farm do to them? He will come back and kill the men in the farm. And he will give the farm to other men to use.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Have you not read this writing: "The stone which the builders would not use is now the chief stone of the corner. The Lord did this. It looks wonderful to us."?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">They tried to catch Jesus but they feared the people. They knew that Jesus had spoken this against them. So they left him and went away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">They sent some Pharisees and some of Herods people to Jesus. They planned how to make Jesus say something wrong.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">They came and said to him, Teacher, we know that you are true. You do not fear any person or care how great he is. But you teach the true way of God. Tell us, is it right to pay taxes to Caesar or is it not?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Should we pay taxes or not? Jesus knew they were trying to get him into trouble. So he said to them, Why are you trying to get me to do wrong? Bring me a piece of money.  Let me look at it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">They brought one to him. He asked, Whose picture and name is this? They answered,  Caesars.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">So he said, Give to Caesar what belongs to Caesar and give to God what belongs to God.  The Pharisees and Herods people were much surprised at Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Some of the Sadducees came to Jesus. They say that people do not rise from death. They asked Jesus a question.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Teacher, they said, Moses gave us this law: if a man dies and leaves a wife but no children, then his brother must marry the wife and raise a family for his brother.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">There were seven brothers. The first one married. He died and left no child.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">e second brother married the wife. He also died and left no child. It was the same with the third one.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">All seven brothers married her. They all had no children. Last of all the woman died also.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Now then when people rise from death, whose wife will she be? All seven of them had married her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Jesus said to them, You are wrong! You do not know what the holy writings say. And you do not know what power God has.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">When people rise from death, men and women do not marry. But they are like angels in heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">People do rise from death! Have you never read what Moses wrote? It is in the place where we read about the small tree which burned. Moses tells how God said to him, "I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">He is not the God of dead people, but of living people. The way you look at things is wrong altogether.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">One of the scribes heard them talking. He saw that Jesus gave them a good answer. Then he came and asked, Which law is the greatest law of all?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Jesus answered, The greatest one is, "Hear, O Israel. The Lord our God is one Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Love the Lord your God with all your heart. Love him with all your soul. Love him with all your mind. And love him with all your strength."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">The second law is this: "Love your neighbour as you love yourself." No law is greater than these laws.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">Then the scribe answered Jesus, Teacher, what you say is right. There is one God.  There are no other gods.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">Love God with all your heart. Love him with all your understanding. Love him with all your strength. That is much better than to burn offerings and make sacrifices. Love your neighbour as you love yourself. That is better than any of these offerings and sacrifices.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Jesus saw that the scribe was wise. So he said to him, You are not far from the kingdom of God. After that everyone feared to ask him any more questions.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">Jesus was teaching people in the temple. He said, How can the scribes say that Christ is Davids son?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">The Holy Spirit spoke through David and he himself said: "The LORD said to my Lord,  Sit beside me until I make you master over your enemies."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">So David calls Christ his Lord. How can Christ be Davids son? Most of the people were glad to hear Jesus teaching.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">Jesus went on to teach them. He said, Take care. Do not let the scribes fool you by the way they do things. They like to walk about with long gowns. They want people to greet them in the market.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">They want to sit in the front seats in the meeting houses. They want to sit in the best places at feasts.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">They take away the homes of women whose husbands are dead. They cover up the wrong things they do by talking to God a long time. They will be punished more!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">Jesus sat down in the temple near the place where people put in their money. He saw how the people put in money. Many rich people put in much money.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">A poor woman, whose husband was dead, came. She put in two small pieces of money.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">Jesus called his disciples. He said, I tell you the truth. This poor woman has given more money than all the other people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">All these people had plenty of money and they gave only a part of it. She was poor and she gave everything she had. She has nothing left to live on.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">When Jesus was leaving the temple, one of his disciples said, Look Master, see those big stones and the wonderful houses!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Jesus said, You see these big houses? I tell you, not one stone here will be left on top of another. They will all be thrown down!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Afterwards, he was sitting on the hill called the Mount of Olives, near the temple. Peter,  James, John, and Andrew came to him alone.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">They said, Tell us, when will this happen? What will be the sign when these things are going to be done?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Then Jesus began to talk to them. He said, Take care. Do not let anyone fool you.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="11">When men take you to court, do not be troubled about what you will say. Say whatever comes to your mind at that time. It is not you who speak, but it is the Holy Spirit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">A brother will take his brother to be killed. A father will take his child. The children will talk against their father and mother and have them killed.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="14">Daniel the Man of God said that people would put something very bad in the temple.  (Let the one who reads this understand it.) When that happens, the people in Judea must go quickly to the hills.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="22">People will come and say they are the Christ. People will come and say they are prophets of God. But they are not true to themselves. They will show big signs and do wonderful things that will fool people. They will fool Gods chosen people if they can.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">The Passover Feast and the feast with bread that has no yeast in it was two days later.  The chief priests and the scribes planned how to catch Jesus by some trick. They wanted to kill him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">But they said, Let us not do it on the day of the feast. We do not want the people to start fighting about it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">When Jesus was in the town of Bethany, he was in Simons house. Simon had leprosy.  While Jesus sat at the table, a woman came to him. She had a bottle of oil. It smelled very nice and cost much money. She broke the bottle and poured the oil on Jesus head.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Some people there were angry. They said, Why was this oil wasted like that?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">The oil might have been sold for a lot of money. Then the money could have been given to poor people. They said to the woman, You should not have done this!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But Jesus said, Leave the woman alone. Why do you trouble her? She has done a good thing to me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">You will always have poor people with you. Any time you want to, you can do good to them. But I will not always be with you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">She has done what she could. She has put oil on my body to make me ready to be buried.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">I tell you the truth. Any place in the whole world where people tell the good news, people will also tell what she has done. People will remember her because of it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve disciples, went to the chief priests. He told them how he could help them catch Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">They were glad when they heard that. They promised to give him money. So he watched for a good way to help them catch Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">It was the first day of the feast with bread that has no yeast in it. The sheep had to be killed for the Passover Feast. His disciples asked Jesus Where do you want us to make ready for you to eat the Passover Feast?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">He sent two of his disciples and said to them, Go into the city. There you will meet a man who is carrying a pot of water. Follow him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">When he goes into a house, talk to the master of the house. Say to him, "The Teacher says, Where is my room where I can eat the Passover Feast with my disciples?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">The man will show you a large room upstairs. It will be all fixed up and ready. Get the Passover food ready for us there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">The disciples went to the city. They found everything just as he had said. There they made the Passover food ready.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">In the evening he came with the twelve disciples.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">While they were sitting at the table eating, Jesus said, I tell you the truth. One of you who is eating with me will give me over to people who hate me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">They were sad and troubled. One after the other began to say to him, Lord, is it I?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Jesus answered them, It is one of you twelve. It is the one who puts his hand in the same dish with me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">The Son of Man will go just as the holy writings tell about him. But the man who gives him over will have trouble. It would have been better for that man if he had not been born!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">As they were eating, Jesus took some bread. He thanked God for it and broke it. Then he gave it to the disciples and said, Take this bread and eat it. It is my body.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">He also took a cup. He thanked God for it. Then he gave it to them. They all drank some of it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Then he said to them, This is my blood. It is given for many people. It makes the agreement strong.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">I tell you the truth. I will not drink any of the fruit of the vine again until I drink some of it new in the kingdom of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">They sang a song and then went out to the hill called Olives.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Jesus said to them, All of you will leave me this night. the holy writings say, "I will kill the one who takes care of the sheep. And the sheep will run away."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">But after I am raised from death, I will go to Galilee to meet you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Peter said, Even if all the others leave you, I will never leave you.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="31">Peter said, Even if I must die with you, I will never say I do not know you! They all said the same thing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">Then they came to a place called Gethsemane. Jesus said to his disciples, Sit here. I will go and talk with God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">He took Peter, James, and John along with him. Jesus began to be sad and troubled.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">He said to them, My heart is very sad. I am almost dying! Stay here and watch.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">Jesus went on a little farther. He fell on the ground and asked God that, if it could be so,  this big trouble might pass by him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">He said, Oh, my Father, you can do all things. Take this cup away from me. But do not do what I want, but what you want.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">Jesus went back and found the disciples sleeping. He said to Peter, Simon, are you sleeping? Could you not watch one hour?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">All of you must watch and talk with God so that you will not do wrong. A persons heart can want to do it, but his body is weak.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">Jesus went away again and said the same words to God again.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">Jesus went back again and found the disciples sleeping. They could not keep their eyes open. They did not know what to say to Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">Then he went back the third time. He said, Are you still sleeping and resting?. It is enough. The time has come now. The Son of Man is given over to bad people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">Get up. Let us go. Look, here comes the one who will give me over to people who hate me!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">While he was saying this, Judas came. He was one of the twelve disciples. Many people came with him. They had long knives or swords and big sticks. The chief priests, the scribes, and the leaders had sent them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">The man who was going to help them catch Jesus had told them that he would give them a sign. He said, The man that I kiss is the one. Catch him and take him away safely.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">So when he came, he went to Jesus right away. He said, Master! And he kissed him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">Then they caught Jesus and held him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">One of the men standing by took his sword. He cut off the ear of the high priests servant.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">Jesus said, Have you come to take me with knives and sticks the way you would take a man who steals?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">Every day I was with you in the temple and taught. You did not catch me then. But what the holy writings say will come true.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">Then all of the disciples left Jesus and ran away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="51">A young man went with Jesus. He had a piece of cloth about him. The people caught him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="52">But he left the cloth behind and ran away without any clothes on.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="53">The people took Jesus away to the high priest. All the chief priests, the leaders, and the scribes met there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="54">Peter followed far behind Jesus. He went into the yard of the high priests house. He sat down with the people who worked for the high priest. He warmed himself by the fire.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="55">The chief priests, and all the judges of the court tried to find men to say Jesus had done something wrong so they could kill him. But they found none.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="56">Many people came and said things that were not true. But one said this thing and the other said that thing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="57">Then some stood up to talk against Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="58">They said, We heard him say, "I will break down this temple which people have built with hands. In three days I will build another temple but not with hands."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="59">Others said, No, that is not what he said.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="60">The high priest stood up among the people and asked Jesus, Have you no answer? What do you have to say about this? They have said something against you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="61">But Jesus said nothing at all. Then the high priest asked him, Are you the Christ, the Son of the Blessed One?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="62">Jesus answered, Yes, I am. You will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the One who has all power. You will see him coming on the clouds of the sky!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="63">Then the high priest tore his clothes and said, We do not need any more proof against him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="64">What he has said is wrong! What do you think? They all said, He should be killed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="65">Some people began to spit on him. They covered his face and hit him. They laughed at him and said, Tell us if you know who hit you! The guards took him away and hit him as they went.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="66">Peter sat out in the yard. A servant girl who worked for the high priest came.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="67">She saw Peter warming himself by the fire. She looked at him and said, You were also with Jesus of Nazareth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="68">But Peter said, I do not know or understand what you are talking about. Peter went out to the gate. Then a cock called.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="69">A girl saw Peter there and said to the other people standing by, This man is one of them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="70">But again Peter said he was not. A little while after, those standing around said to Peter,  Surely you are one of them also. You come from Galilee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="71">Then Peter began to curse and say bad words. He said, I do not know this man you are talking about!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="72">Right then the cock called a second time and Peter remembered that Jesus had said,  Before the cock calls two times, you will say three times that you do not know me.  Then he broke down and cried.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">As soon as it was morning, the chief priests, leaders, and the scribes talked together.  They tied Jesus and took him before Pilate to be judged.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="9">Then Pilate asked, Do you want me to let the King of the Jews go free?</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="12">Pilate asked them, Then what shall I do with the man whom you call King of the Jews?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">They shouted back, Nail him to a cross!</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="14">Jesus said to him, Do not tell anyone about this. But go and let the priest look at you.  Moses gave a law about the sacrifice you must give when you are healed. Give it to prove to the people that you are healed.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="20">Jesus saw that they believed he would be healed. So he said to him, Man, the wrong things you have done are forgiven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">The scribes and Pharisees began to talk about this. They said, Who is this man that is not giving respect to God? No one but God can forgive anyone for the wrong things they have done.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Jesus knew what they were thinking. He said, Why do you think these wrong things in your hearts?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Which is easier, to say, "The wrong things you have done are forgiven," or to say, "Get up and walk"?</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="9">Jesus said to them, I ask you, is it right to do good things on the Sabbath day, or to do wrong things? Is it right to heal people so that they will live, or to let them die?</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="5">He loves our people and he built the meeting house for us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Jesus went with them. When he came near the house, the officer sent some friends to meet him and to say, Sir, do not trouble yourself to come further. I am not good enough to have you come into my house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And I did not think I was good enough to come to you. Just say the word and my servant will be healed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">I myself am a man who takes orders, and I have soldiers who take orders from me. I say to one, "Go," and he goes. I say to another, "Come," and he comes. I say to my servant,  "Do this," and he does it.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="22">He answered Johns disciples, Go tell John what you have seen and heard. Blind people see. The lame people walk. People with leprosy are healed. People who could not hear can hear. Dead people are alive again. Poor people hear the good news.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Happy is the person who is not troubled in his heart about me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">When Johns messengers had gone away, Jesus began to talk to the people about John.  He said, What did you go out into the desert to see? Did you go out to see a tall grass moving in the wind?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">What did you go out to see? A man wearing fine clothes? People who wear fine clothes and have nice things live in kings houses.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">What did you go out to see? A prophet of God? Yes, I tell you, and he is much more than a prophet.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">He is the one the holy writings tell about: "See, I send my messenger ahead of you. He will make the way ready for you."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">I tell you, no one has ever been born who is greater than John. And yet, the smallest one in the kingdom of God is greater than he.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="30">But the Pharisees and teachers of the law would not follow Gods way and they were not baptised by John.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Jesus asked, What will I say that the people of today are like? What are they like?</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="35">A man is proved wise by what he has done.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">One of the Pharisees asked Jesus to come and eat with him. So Jesus went into the Pharisees house and sat down to eat.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">In that city was a bad woman. When she knew that Jesus was eating at the Pharisees house, she came and brought a bottle of oil. It was oil that smelled very sweet and cost much money.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">She stood behind Jesus by his feet, and she was crying. She began to wash his feet with her tears and wiped them with her hair. Then she kissed his feet and put oil on them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">The Pharisee who had asked Jesus to his house saw this. He said to himself, If this man were a prophet of God, he would know what kind of woman is touching him. She is a bad woman.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">Jesus said to him, Simon, I have something to say to you. And he said, Teacher, say it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">Jesus said, There was a man who used to lend money to people. Two people owed him money. One man owed him five hundred pieces of silver money. The other owed him fifty pieces.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">They could not pay the money, so he let them both free. Now which one of them will love him more?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">Simon answered, I would say the one he let off the most. Jesus said, You are right.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">Then he turned towards the woman. He said to Simon, Do you see this woman? I came into your house. You did not give me water to wash my feet. But she has washed my feet with her tears and wiped them with her hair.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">You did not kiss me. But since she came in, she has kissed my feet again and again.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">You did not put oil on my head. But she has put sweet smelling oil on my feet.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">So I tell you, she has done many wrong things, but she has been forgiven because she loved me so much. But one who has been forgiven a little loves me only a little</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">Jesus said to the woman, The wrong things you have done are forgiven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">Then those who were at the table with him began to say to themselves, Who is this man?  He even forgives people for the wrong things they have done.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">Jesus said to the woman, You are saved because you believed. Go in peace.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="8">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Soon after this, Jesus went through the cities and towns. He told the people Gods word about the good news of the kingdom of God. The twelve disciples were with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Some women were also with him. They had bad spirits and had been sick. But they had been healed. One was Mary, called Magdalene. Seven bad spirits had gone out of her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Another one was Joanna, the wife of Chuza, who worked for Herod. Another one was Susanna. And there were many others who gave what they could to help him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Many people came to him from many towns. Then he told them a story.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">He said, A man went out to sow his seed. As he sowed it, some seed fell on the road.  People stepped on the seed. Birds ate it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Some seed fell on the stony ground. It grew but soon died because the place was too dry.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Some seed fell among the weeds. The weeds grew up and made the new plants die.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">But some seed fell on good ground and it grew well. Those plants gave a hundred times as much grain as the man sowed. When Jesus had said this, he called out, Everyone who has ears to hear, listen!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">His disciples asked Jesus what this story meant.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">He said to them, You can learn the secret things about the kingdom of God. But other people must have stories. They will look, but they will not see. They will hear, but they will not understand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Now here is what the story means. The seed is Gods word.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Some seeds fell on the road. They are like the people who hear the word of God. Then the devil comes and takes the word out of their hearts. He does not want them to believe and be saved.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Some seeds fell on the stones. They are like people who are glad when they hear the word. But it does not go down deep into their hearts. They believe for a short time. But when they have trouble they stop believing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Some seeds fell among the weeds. They are like people who hear the word. But they think about the things of this world. They want to get money and things to be happy in this life. As they go on in life, these things push the message out of their hearts and no good comes from them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Some seeds fell on good ground. They are like people who hear the word and remember it. Their hearts are honest and good. These people keep on believing, and much good comes from them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">No person lights a lamp and covers it with a basket or puts it under a bed. But he puts it on the place for a lamp. Then people who come in can see the light.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Everything that is hidden will be seen. Everything that is secret will be known and come out to be seen.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">So take care how you listen. Anyone who has something will get more. But he who does not have anything, even the little that he has will be taken away from him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">The mother of Jesus and his brothers came to him. They could not reach him because there were so many people around him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Someone told him, Your mother and brothers are standing outside. They want to talk to you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">But he said to them, These people who hear the word of God and do it, they are my mother and my brothers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">One day Jesus got into a boat with his disciples. He said to them, Let us cross over to the other side of the sea. So they started out.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">While they were going, Jesus was sleeping. A bad storm came on the sea. Water was coming into the boat, and they were in trouble.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">The disciples came to Jesus and woke him. They shouted, Master! Master! We will die!  Jesus woke and said to the wind and the water, Stop! They stopped. Then all was quiet</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">He said to the disciples, Why do you not believe God? They were afraid and surprised.  They said to each other, What kind of man is this? He tells the wind and the sea what to do and they obey him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">They came to the other side of the sea, to the country of the Gadarene people. Their country is on the other side of the sea from Galilee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">As Jesus got out of the boat a man met him from the town. He had bad spirits in him. He had not worn clothes for a long time. He did not live in a house, but among the graves.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">When he saw Jesus, he screamed loudly and bowed down in front of him. He called out loud, Jesus, Son of the Highest One! What do you want to do to me? I beg you, do not hurt me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">He said this because Jesus had told the bad spirit to come out of the man. Many times the spirit had taken hold of the man. People had guarded him. They had tied him with chains and strong ropes. But he broke the chains and ropes. The bad spirit drove him into the desert.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Jesus asked him, What is your name? He answered, My name is An Army. He said this because many bad spirits had gone into him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">The spirits begged Jesus not to send them away to the big hole that has no bottom.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">Many pigs were feeding on the hill there. The spirits begged Jesus to let them go into the pigs. Jesus let them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">The spirits came out of the man and went into the pigs. They ran fast down the steep hill into the sea. They died in the water.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">The men who cared for the pigs saw what happened. They ran and told it to the people in the town and in the country.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">The people went out to see what had happened. They came to Jesus. They saw the man from whom the bad spirits had gone. He was sitting near the feet of Jesus. He had clothes on and was not crazy any more. The people were afraid.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">Those who had seen it told the people how the man had been saved from the bad spirits.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">All the people in the country around the Gadarenes asked Jesus to go away from them to some other place. They were very much afraid. So Jesus got into a boat and went back.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">The man from whom the bad spirits had gone begged to go with him. But Jesus sent him away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">He said, Go home and tell the people what God has done for you. So the man went away and told the people all through the town what Jesus had done for him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">When Jesus came back, the people were very glad to see him. They were all waiting for him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">A man named Jairus came to him. He was a ruler in the meeting house. He bowed down in front of Jesus and begged him to come to his house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">He had only one daughter She was about twelve years old. And she was dying. Many people went with Jesus and pushed against him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">A woman among them had a sickness for twelve years. She was bleeding all the time.  She had given all her money to the doctors, but no one had been able to heal her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">She came behind Jesus and touched his clothes. The bleeding stopped right away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">Jesus said, Who touched me? Everyone said, Not I! Peter said, Master, the people are all around you and push you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">But Jesus said, Someone touched me. I know that power to heal went out from me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">The woman saw that he knew about her. So she came trembling and bowed down in front of him. She told him in front of all the people why she had touched him. She told him that she had been healed right away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">Jesus said to her, Daughter, you were healed because you believed. Go and do not be troubled.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">While he was still talking, a man came from the rulers house. He said, Your daughter has died. Do not trouble the Teacher any more.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">Jesus heard it. He said, Do not fear. Only believe and she will be healed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="51">When Jesus came to the house, he did not let the people go in with him. The only people he let go in were Peter, John and James, and the girls father and mother.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Jesus called his twelve disciples together. He gave them power over all the bad spirits,  and power to heal sick people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">He sent them out to tell people about the kingdom of God and to heal sick people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">He said, Take nothing with you for your trip. Do not take a walking stick, or a bag, or food, or money. And do not take two shirts.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">When you go into a certain house, stay there until you leave the town.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Some people might not take you in. When you leave that town, shake the dust off your feet. That will be a sign to them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">The disciples left and went through the towns. They told the good news and healed people everywhere.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Herod the ruler heard about all that was happening. He did not know what to think.  Some people said John the Baptizer had risen from death.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Some people said Elijah had come back. And other people said that one of the old prophets of God had risen from death.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Herod said, I cut off Johns head. Now who is this man of whom I hear such things? He wanted to see Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">When the apostles came back, they told Jesus all they had done. He took them away with him and they went by themselves to a town called Bethsaida.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">But the people found out and they followed him. He was glad to see them and talked to them about Gods kingdom. He healed those who were sick.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">When it was late in the day, the twelve disciples came to him. They said, Send the people away so they can go to the towns and the farms to sleep and get something to eat.  This is a lonely place.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">But Jesus said to them, You give them food to eat. They said, All we have is five loaves of bread and two fish. Shall we go and buy food for all these people?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">There were about five thousand men. He said to his disciples, Tell the people to sit down in groups of fifty.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">They did what he said, and they made all the people sit down.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">He took the five loaves of bread and the two fish. He looked up to heaven and thanked God for them. Then he broke the bread. He gave it to the disciples to give to the people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">They all ate and had enough. They picked up twelve baskets full of pieces that were left.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">One day Jesus was alone talking to God. His disciples were there too. He asked them,  Who do people say I am?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">They answered, Some people say you are John the Baptizer. Others say you are Elijah.  And others say that one of the old prophets of God has risen from death.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Jesus said, But who do you say I am? Peter answered, You are the Christ sent by God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Jesus said to them, Do not tell this to anyone.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Then he went on to say, The Son of Man will have much trouble. The leaders of the people, the chief priests, and the scribes will not believe him. He will be killed. On the third day he will be raised from death.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And He said to all the people, If anyone wants to come with me, he must leave what he himself wants to do. Every day he must take up his cross &lt;FI&gt;be ready to die&lt;Fi&gt; and come with me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Anyone who tries to keep his life will lose it. And anyone who gives up his life for my sake will find it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">What good will it do a man if he gets the whole world for himself but loses his life or spoils it?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">If anyone is ashamed of me and the things I say, the Son of man will be ashamed of that person when he comes. The Son of man will come with his holy angels and be great like his Father.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">I tell you the truth. Some people are standing here who will not die before they see the kingdom of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">About eight days after saying these things, Jesus went up on a hill to talk with God. He took Peter, John, and James with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">As he was talking with God, he was changed. His face was different. His clothes became very white and shining.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And then two men were talking with Jesus. They were Moses and Elijah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Light was shining from them. They talked about his leaving this world. That would happen when he was in Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">Peter and the others were very sleepy. They woke up and saw the light shining from Jesus. And they saw the two men standing with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">When the men were leaving Jesus, Peter said to him, Master, it is good for us to be here.  Let us make three places here, one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah. Peter did not know what he was saying.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">As he said this, a cloud came over them. They were very much afraid when the cloud came around them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">A voice in the cloud said, This is my dear Son. Listen to him!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">The talking stopped. Then Jesus was left alone. The disciples did not say anything. They did not tell anyone at that time what they had seen.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">The next day they came down the hill. Many people met him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">One man among them called out, Teacher, I beg you, look at my son. He is my only child.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">A bad spirit takes hold of him and he screams. It throws him around and makes him foam at his mouth. It beats him badly and does not want to leave him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">I begged your disciples to drive the bad spirit out, but they could not do it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">Jesus said, You people today do not believe. You have turned away from God. How long must I be with you? How long must I put up with you? Bring the boy here to me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">While he was coming, the bad spirit knocked him down and threw him around. Jesus told the spirit to stop. He healed the boy and gave him back to his father.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">All the people were surprised to see that God has so much power. While the people were wondering about everything Jesus did, he talked to his disciples.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">He said, Listen well to what I say. The Son of Man will be given over to men,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">But they did not understand what he said. The meaning was hidden from them so they would not understand it. And they were afraid to ask him about it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">The disciples started talking among themselves. They quarrelled about which of them was the greatest person.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">Jesus knew what they were thinking. So he took a child and put him by his side.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">Then he said, If anyone takes in a child like this for my sake, he takes in me. And if anyone takes in me, he takes in the one who sent me. The one who takes the least or lowest place among you is the greatest.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">John answered, Master, we saw a man driving bad spirits out of people. He was using your name. We told him to stop because he is not one of us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">But Jesus said, Do not stop him. Anyone who is not against you is on your side.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="51">The time was near for Jesus to be taken up to heaven. Then he started off for Jerusalem.  He sent messengers ahead of him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="52">They went to one of the towns of the Samaritan people to get ready for him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="53">But the people would not take him in because he was going to Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="54">When the disciples James and John saw that, they said, Lord, do you want us to ask for fire to come down from the sky and burn them up?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="55">But he turned and said to them, Stop that! You do not think about what kind of spirit you are showing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="56">The Son of Man did not come to kill people, but to save them. And they went on to another town.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="57">As they went along on the road, a man said to him, I will go anywhere you go.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="58">Jesus said, Foxes have holes to live in. Birds have nests. But the Son of Man has no place to lie down to rest.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="59">Jesus said to another man who followed him, Come with me. But the man said, Lord,  let me go first and bury my father.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="60">Jesus said to him, Let those who are dead bury their own dead people. As for you, go and tell people about Gods kingdom.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="61">Another man said to Jesus, Sir, I will go with you. But let me go first to my home and tell them I am going.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="62">Jesus said to him, Any person who starts doing something and then keeps looking back is not fit for the kingdom of God.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="10">
      <VERS vnumber="1">After this the Lord chose seventy other men. He sent them ahead of him, two by two. He sent them to every town and village that he was going to visit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">He said to them, The harvest is much, but there are not many people to gather it. So talk to the Lord of this harvest and ask him to send out people to his harvest.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Go on your way now. I am sending you out among people. You will be like sheep among bad animals.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Do not take money, or a bag, or shoes. And do not stop to talk with anyone on the road.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">When you go into a house, first say, "May God give peace to this family."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">If a man of peace is there, your blessing will stay with him. If not, your blessing will come back to you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Stay in that house. Eat and drink what the people give you. The one who works should have his pay for it. Do not move from one house to another house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">When you go into a town and they take you in, eat what is put before you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Heal the sick people in the town. Tell the people, "The kingdom of God has come to you."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">But when you go into a town and they do not take you in, then go out into the streets of the town.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Say to the people, "We wipe off even the dust of the town that is on our feet. This will be a sign to you. But remember this, the kingdom of God has come."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">I tell you this. On the day when people are judged, they will be punished more than the people in the city of Sodom.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Chorazin, you will have trouble! Bethsaida, you will have trouble! If the big works I did in you had been done in the cities of Tyre and Sidon, the people there would have stopped doing bad things long ago. They would wear the clothes people wear to show they are sad, and would sit in ashes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">But on the day when people are judged you will be punished more than the people in the cities of Tyre and Sidon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Capernaum, will you be lifted up to the sky? No, you will go down to the place of the dead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Anyone who listens to you listens to me. Anyone who does not believe you does not believe me. Anyone who does not believe me does not believe the one who sent me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">The seventy men Jesus had sent out came back very happy. They said, Lord, even the bad spirits obey us when we talk to them in your name!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Jesus said to them, I saw Satan fall from the sky like lightning.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">I have given you power over all the power of the enemy. Nothing will hurt you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Do not be glad that the bad spirits obey you. But be glad that your names are written in the book in heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">At that same time the Holy Spirit made Jesus very happy. Jesus said, Father, you are Lord of heaven and earth. I thank you because you have hidden these things from people who are wise and know many things. But you have shown them to people who are like children. Yes, Father. That was the way you wanted it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">My Father has given everything to me. No one knows who the Son is but the Father. No one knows who the Father is but the Son and those to whom the Son wants to show him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Then Jesus turned to his disciples and said to them alone, God is blessing the eyes of people who see what you see!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">I tell you this. Many prophets and kings wanted to see the things you see. But they did not see them. They wanted to hear the things you hear. But they did not hear them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">A man who taught Gods law stood up and asked Jesus a question to try him out.  Teacher, he said. What must I do so that I will live for ever?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Jesus said to him, What does the law say? What do you read there?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">The man answered, You must love the Lord your God with all your heart. Love him with all your soul. Love him with all your power, and love him with all your mind. And you must love your neighbour as you love yourself.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Jesus said, That is the right answer. Do that and you will live for ever.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">But the man wanted to prove that he was all right. So he said to Jesus, Who is my neighbour?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Jesus answered, A man was going from Jerusalem to Jericho. Bad men caught him on the road. They took his clothes and beat him. Then they went away and left him half dead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">A priest happened to be going down that road. He saw the man but he passed by on the other side of the road.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">A man who worked in the temple came along to that place also. He saw the man but he passed by on the other side.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">A man from the country of Samaria was going on that road also, and came to the place.  He saw the man and wanted to share in his troubles.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">He went to him and tied up the sores he had from the beating. He washed them with oil and wine. Then he lifted the man up and set him on his own animal to ride. He took him to the house for strangers. And he cared for him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">The next day he gave two pieces of money to the man who was in charge of the house for strangers. He said, "Take care of this man. If it costs you more than this, I will pay you when I come back.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">Jesus said to the teacher of the law, What do you think? Which of these three was a neighbour to the man who was caught by the bad men?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">He said, The man who was kind to him. Jesus said, Go and do as he did.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">Jesus and his disciples went on their way. They came to a town. A woman named Martha took him into her home.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">She had a sister named Mary. Mary sat near the feet of Jesus and she listened to what he said.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">But Martha was very busy doing many things for Jesus. She came to Jesus and said,  Lord, my sister has left me to do all the work. Do you not care? Tell her to come and help me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">The Lord answered her, Martha, Martha, you are worrying. You are troubled about many things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">Only one thing is needed. What Mary has chosen is good. And it will not be taken away from her.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="11">
      <VERS vnumber="1">One day Jesus was in a place talking with God. When he had finished, one of his disciples said to him, Lord, teach us to talk with God as John taught his disciples.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Jesus said, When you talk with God, say, "Our Father in heaven, may your name be kept holy. May your kingdom come.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Give us our food day by day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Forgive us for the wrong things we have done. We forgive everyone who has done wrong to us. Do not lead us to be tested."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Jesus said to them, Maybe one of you has a friend. You go to him in the middle of the night and say to him, "Friend, lend me three loaves of bread.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">A friend has come to my house. He has been on the road. I have no food to give him to eat."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Maybe the friend in the house answers you and says, "Do not trouble me. The door is locked. And my children and I are in bed. I cannot get up and give you anything."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">I tell you this. Maybe he will not give him anything because he is his friend. But he will get up and give him what he needs because he keeps on asking for it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And I tell you, ask and you will get what you ask for. Look and you will find what you look for. Knock and the door will be opened for you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Everyone who asks will get. The one who looks will find. And the one who knocks will have the door opened for him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Which of you fathers will give your son a snake if he asks for a fish?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Will you give him a scorpion &lt;FI&gt;an insect with a sting&lt;Fi&gt; if he asks for an egg?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">You are wrong and yet you know how to give good things to your children. Much more,  the Father in heaven will give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Jesus was driving a bad spirit out of a man who could not talk. When the spirit left him,  the man could talk. The people were surprised.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">But some of them said, This man drives out bad spirits by the help of Beelzebub, the chief of bad spirits.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Other people wanted to test Jesus. They asked him to show them a sign from heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">But Jesus knew what they were thinking. So he said, If one part of any country fights against the other part of the country, that country is spoiled. And if one part of any family fights against the other part of the family, it cannot stand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">If Satan fights against himself, how will his kingdom stand? You say I drive out bad spirits by the help of Beelzebub.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">If I drive out bad spirits by the help of Beelzebub, by whose help do your own people drive them out? Your own people will judge you for this!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">But if I drive out bad spirits by the help of God, then know this, Gods kingdom is here with you now.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">A strong man has something in his hand to fight. He guards his place. He will not lose his things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">But when a stronger man comes, he catches the man who guards his house. He will take away what is in the mans hand. And he will take his things and give them to his friends.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Anyone who is not with me is against me. Anyone who does not work with me, works against me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">When a bad spirit has gone out of a man, he goes through dry places. He looks for a place to rest, but he does not find any. Then he says, "I will go back to my house from where I came."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">When he comes back, he finds it clean and all fixed up.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Then he goes and brings seven other spirits who are worse than he is. They go in and live there. Now the man is worse than he was at first.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">As he said this, a woman among the people called out, Happy is your mother who gave birth to you, and fed you as a baby.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">But Jesus said, Happy are those who hear Gods word and obey it!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">More and more people were coming. He started to talk. He said, People today are bad.  They want a sign. No sign will be given them but the sign of Jonah the prophet of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Jonah was a sign to the men in the city of Nineveh. In the same way the Son of Man will be a sign to the people today.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">When the people are judged, the Queen from the South will stand up and speak against men who live today. She came a long way to hear the wise words of Solomon. The one who is here is greater than Solomon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">When people are judged, the men of Nineveh will stand up and speak against the people of today. They stopped their wrong ways when Jonah told them Gods word. And the one who is here is greater than Jonah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">No person lights a lamp and hides it in a hole or puts it under a basket. But he puts it on a place for a lamp. Then people who come in can see the light.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Your body gets its light through your eyes. When you have good eyes, all your body has light. But when your eyes are bad, your body is in darkness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">So be sure that it is not dark in you where it should be light.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">If no part of your body is dark, it will all be light. It will be like a lamp that shines to give you light.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">While Jesus was saying these things, a Pharisee asked him to come to eat at his house. So Jesus went in and sat at the table.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">The Pharisee saw that Jesus did not wash his hands before he ate. He was surprised.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">The Lord said to him, You Pharisees wash the outside of a cup and a dish clean. But inside you are full of greed and wrong ways.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">You are fools! Did not God make the outside and inside also?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">Do good, and do it from your heart. Then everything is clean for you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">You Pharisees will have trouble! You give to God a tenth part of small garden plants. But you do not judge in the right way. And you do not love God. You should do these things and the other things too.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">You Pharisees will have trouble! In the meeting houses you want to sit in the front seats.  And in the market you want people to greet you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">You will have trouble! You are not true to yourselves! You are like graves that are not marked. Men walk over them and do not know it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">Then one of the men who taught Gods law said to Jesus, Teacher, when you say these things, you talk against us too.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">Jesus said, You men will have trouble also! You put heavy loads on peoples backs. But you yourselves will not put up one finger to help carry the loads.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">You will have trouble! You build places to bury the prophets of God that your fathers killed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">In this way you show you agree to the things your fathers did. They killed the prophets,  and you build places to bury them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">That is why God, who is wise, said, "I will send prophets and messengers to them. They will kill some of them. And they will trouble some of them."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">So the people who are living now will be punished for all the blood of the prophets of God that is on the ground since the world was made.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="51">I mean all the blood from the time of Abel to the time of Zechariah. (He was killed between the holy table and the temple.) Yes, I tell you. The people who are living now will be punished for all of it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="52">You teachers of Gods law will have trouble! You have taken away the key of the door where people can go in and know what is true. You yourselves did not go in, and you stopped those who were going in.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="53">When Jesus left the house, the scribes and Pharisees began to be very angry with him.  They asked him questions about many things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="54">They wanted him to say something that was wrong so they could make trouble for him.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="12">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Many thousands of people had gathered. They stepped on each other. Jesus began to talk to the disciples. He said, Take care. Do not let the yeast of the Pharisees spoil you. They are not true to themselves.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Everything that is covered up will be seen. Everything that is hidden will be known.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">What you have said in the dark will be heard in the light. What you have said in secret with the door shut will be told from the tops of the houses.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">You are my friends. I tell you, do not fear people who can kill your bodies. After that they cannot do anything more to you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">I will tell you whom you must fear. Fear the one who, after he has killed, has the power to throw into hell. Yes, I tell you, fear him!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Are not five sparrows sold for a tiny sum of money? Yet God does not forget about one of them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Even the number of hairs on your head is known. So do not fear. You are worth more than many sparrows.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And I tell you. If anyone tells people that he knows me, the Son of Man will also tell the angels of God that he knows him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">But if anyone tells people he does not know me, the Son of Man will also tell the angels of God that he does not know that person.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Everyone who says anything against the Son of Man will be forgiven. But anyone who says wrong things against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">When men take you to the meeting houses and to the rulers and to the courts, do not be troubled about what you will answer or say.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">The Holy Spirit will teach you at the right time what you must say.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">One of the people in the crowd said, Teacher, tell my brother to divide with me the things my father left when he died.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Jesus said, Man, who made me a judge over you or gave me power to divide your things?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Then he said to the people, Take care. Do not be greedy in any way to get more and more things. Even if a man has much more than he needs, it cannot give him life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Then he told them a story. He said, A rich man had a farm. The things that grew on it were many.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">He said to himself, "What will I do? I have no place to keep all the food I have grown."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">So he said, "This is what I will do. I will break down my storehouses and build bigger ones. I will keep in them all the food and everything I have.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Then I will say to myself, Man, you have much in your storehouses for many years. Rest now. Eat, drink, and have a good time."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">But God said to him, "You are a fool! Tonight you will die. Then who will have all the things you have kept for yourself?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">So anyone who keeps things for himself is not rich in the way God wants him to be rich.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Jesus said to his disciples, So I tell you this. Do not be troubled about what you will eat to keep alive. Do not be troubled about clothes to wear on your body.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="26">If you cannot do a small thing like that, why do you trouble yourself about the other things?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Think about the flowers. See how they grow. They do not work or make cloth. I tell you, King Solomon was a great man. But he was not dressed as fine as one of these flowers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">God dresses the grass in the fields so it looks nice. It is in the field one day and the next day it is burned. If God dresses the grass like that, he cares much more that you have clothes to wear. You do not believe in God very much!</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="30">All the people who are not Jews work for these things. Your Father in heaven knows that you need them.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="44">I tell you the truth. His master will put him in charge of all that he has</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">But perhaps that servant says to himself, "My master will not come just now." Then he begins to beat the other servants. He begins to eat and drink until he is drunk.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">If he does that, his master will come on a day when he is not looking for him. He will not know the time when his master is coming. His master will punish him very much and put him away with those he cannot trust.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">A servant knew what his master wanted. But he was not ready. He did not do what his master wanted him to do. So he will be beaten much.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">But if a servant did not know and did something bad, he will be beaten only a little. To whom much has been given, from him much will be asked. When people give much to anyone, they will ask more from him.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="5">When Jesus came to the tree, he looked up. He said, Zacchaeus, come down right now.  I must stay at your house today.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">So Zacchaeus came down right then. He was glad to have Jesus come in his house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">When all the people saw this, they did not like it. They said, He has gone to visit a bad man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Zacchaeus stood up and said to the Lord, Look, Lord, I will give to the poor people half of all I have. And if I have cheated anyone, I will give him back four times as much as I took.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="10">The Son of Man came to look for and to save those who are lost.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">While they were listening to this, he started to tell them a story. He did so because they were near Jerusalem and the people thought that the kingdom of God would begin right away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">So he said, A man who belonged to a respected family went to a country far away. He went to get power to rule. Then he was going to come back.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="19">The ruler said, "You will rule over five cities."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Then another servant came and said, "Sir, here is your money. I hid it in a cloth and kept it.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="22">The ruler said "You bad servant! I will judge you by your own words. You knew that I was a hard man! You knew that I take in where I put nothing out. You knew that I gather where I did not plant.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Why did you not put my money in the bank? Then when you came home I would have had my money with interest."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Some men were standing there. He said to them, "Take the money from him. Give it to the man who has ten times as much."</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="45">Jesus went into the temple. He began to drive out the people who were buying and selling in the temple.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">He said to them, It is written, "My house shall be a place where people talk with God."  But you have made it a place for people who steal!</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="20">
      <VERS vnumber="1">One day Jesus was teaching the people in the temple. He was telling them Gods good news. The chief priests and the scribes came to him with the leaders.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">They said to him, Tell us what right you have to do these things. Who gave you the right to do them?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">He answered, I will ask you a question also. Tell me this.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Who gave John the right to baptise people? Did God or did men give it to him?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">They talked it over together. They said, If we say, "God gave John the right to do it," he will say, "Then why did you not believe him?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But if we say, "Men gave him the right to do it," then the people will kill us with stones.  They believe that John was a prophet of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">So they answered Jesus, We do not know who gave him the right to do it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Then Jesus said to them, Neither will I tell you what right I have to do these things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Then Jesus began to tell the people this story. A man planted a farm. He let some men use the farm. They paid him money for the rent. Then he went to a country far away and stayed a long time.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">At harvest time the owner sent one of his servants to the men who used the farm. He wanted to have some fruit from the farm. But the men beat the servant and sent him away without any fruit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">So he sent another servant. They beat this one also, and did wrong things to him. And they sent him away without any fruit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">He sent a servant the third time. They hurt this one also and threw him out of the farm.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Then the man who owned the farm said, "What shall I do? I will send my dear son.  Maybe they will respect him."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">But when the men saw him they said to each other, "This is the one who will have everything when his father dies. Let us kill him. Then everything will belong to us."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">They dragged him off the farm and killed him. What will the man who owned the farm do to them?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">He will come back and kill those men. And he will give the farm to other men to use.  When the chief priests and scribes heard this, they said, May it not be so!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">But Jesus looked right at them. He said, What about this writing then? "The stone which the builders would not use is now the chief corner stone."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Everyone who falls on that stone will be broken to pieces. But if that stone falls on anyone, it will crush him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">The scribes and the chief priests wanted to catch Jesus right then but they feared the people. They understood that he had told this story against them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">So they watched for a chance to catch him. And they sent men to spy on him. These men acted as if they were good men. They did this because they wanted to catch him in something that he said. They wanted to give him over to the ruler who would judge and punish him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">So they asked Jesus, Teacher, we know that you talk and teach what is right. You do not fear any person. But you teach the true way of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Is it right to pay money as taxes to Caesar or is it not?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">He knew they were trying to get him into trouble.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">So he said, Show me a piece of money. Whose picture and name are on it? They said,  Caesars</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Then he said to them, So give to Caesar what belongs to Caesar, and give to God what belongs to God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">They were not able to catch him in anything he said in front of the people. They were surprised at his answer and they could not say anything.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Some of the Sadducees came to Jesus. (They say that people do not rise from death.)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">They came to ask Jesus a question. Teacher, they said, Moses gave us this law: "If a man dies and leaves a wife but no children, then his brother must marry the wife and raise a family for his brother."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">There were seven brothers. The first one married. He died and left no children.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">The second one married the wife.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Then the third one married her. All seven brothers married her. They all had no children and they died.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">Last of all, the woman died also.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">Now then, when people rise from death, whose wife will she be? All seven of them had married her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Jesus said to them, Men and women in this world marry.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">But men and women who are good enough to have a place in the next world and to be raised from death do not marry.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">They cannot die again. They are like angels. They are Gods children because they have been raised from death.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">Even Moses showed that people do rise from death. It is in his book where we read about the small tree which burned. Moses says that the Lord is the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">He is not the God of dead people, but of living people. All people are alive to him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">Some of the scribes said to him, Teacher, what you say is right.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">After that, people were afraid to ask him any more questions.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">But Jesus asked them, How can people say that Christ is Davids son?</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="43">David himself says in the book of the Psalms, "The LORD said to my Lord, sit beside me until I make you master over your enemies."</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="45">Then Jesus talked to his disciples while all the people could hear him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">He said, Take care. Do not let the scribes fool you. They like to walk about dressed in long gowns. They want people to greet them in the market. They want to have the front seats in the meeting houses. They want to sit in the best places at feasts.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">Jesus said, I tell you the truth. This poor woman has given more than all the other people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">All these people had plenty of money and they gave only a part of it. She was poor and she gave everything she had. She has nothing left to live on.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Some people were talking about how nice the temple looked. They talked about the fine stones and the things people gave to make the temple.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Jesus said, You see these things. Not one stone here will be left on top of another. They will all be thrown down!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">They asked him, Teacher, when will this happen? What will be the sign when these things are going to be done?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">He said, Take care. Do not let anyone fool you. Many men will come in my name. They will say, "I am Christ." And they will say, "The time is now." Do not go after them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">When you hear about wars and fighting, do not fear. These things must happen first, but it is not the end right away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Then he said, One tribe will fight against another tribe. And one country will fight against another country.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">In some places the earth will shake very much. In many places the people will have no food to eat. And many people will be sick. There will be things to make people fear.  There will be big signs in the sky.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">But before all these things happen, people will catch you and trouble you. They will take you to the meeting houses to be judged. They will put you in prison. They will take you to kings and rulers because you are true to me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">This will be a chance for you to talk about me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">So do not trouble your minds about what you will say.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">I will give you words and sense. All those who are against you will not be able to answer your words or say they are not true.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Even your parents, brothers, family people, and friends will give you over to trouble.  They will kill some of you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">All people will hate you because you are true to me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">But you will not lose one hair from your heads.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">If you keep on being true to me, you will live for ever.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">When you see soldiers all around Jerusalem, then you will know that it will soon be broken down.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Then the people in Judea must go quickly to the hills. Those who are in the city must leave it. Those who are in the country must not come into the city.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Those will be days of punishment. All that has been written in the holy writings must happen.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">In those days it will be very hard for women who are to have a child. It will be very hard for mothers who have babies. There will be big trouble on the earth. God will show his anger to these people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">They will be killed by swords or long knives. They will be taken away as prisoners to every country. Jerusalem will be broken down by people who are not Jews. They will walk over it until the end of their allowed time.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">There will be signs in the sun, moon, and stars. And there will be much trouble for the people on earth. They will not know what to do. It will be like the sound of big waves of the sea.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Men will be weak with fear. They will be afraid of the things that will be happening to the world. The powers in the sky will be shaken.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Then people will see the sign of the Son of Man in a cloud. He will have much power and will be very great.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">When these things begin to happen, look up. Lift up your heads. You will soon be free.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Jesus told them a story. He said, Look at a fig tree. Look at all the trees.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">As soon as you see the leaves coming, you know that it will soon be the warm time of the year.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">It is the same way when you see all these things happening. You will know that the kingdom of God is near.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">I tell you the truth. People who are living then will not die before all these things happen.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">The sky and the earth will pass away, but my words will not pass away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">But take care. Do not think too much about eating, drinking, and things in this life. If you do, that day will come and catch you like a trap.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">That day will come to all people who are living on the whole earth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">Watch all the time. Ask God to make you strong to do right so that you will not go through all these things that are going to happen. Ask him to make you able to stand in front of the Son of Man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">Jesus taught in the temple every day. But at night he went out and stayed on the hill called the Mount of Olives.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">Early in the morning all the people came to hear him in the temple.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="22">
      <VERS vnumber="1">It was near the time for the feast with bread that has no yeast in it. This is called the Passover Feast.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">The chief priests and the scribes planned how to kill Jesus. But they feared the people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Satan came into the heart of Judas. Judas was one of the twelve disciples. His other name was Iscariot.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Judas went away and talked things over with the chief priests and captains. He told them how he could help them catch Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">They were glad, and they said they would give him money for it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">He agreed. He watched for a good way to help them catch Jesus when there were not too many people around.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">It was the day of the feast with bread that has no yeast in it. The sheep had to be killed for the Passover Feast,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">So Jesus sent Peter and John, saying to them, Go and get the Passover Feast ready for us to eat.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">They asked, Where do you want us to get it ready?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">He said, When you go into the city, a man carrying a pot of water will meet you. Follow him into the house where he goes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Tell the master of the house, "The Teacher says, Where is the room where I can eat the Passover Feast with my disciples?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">He will show you a large room upstairs. It will be all fixed up. Make it ready there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">So they went and found everything just the way Jesus had said. Then they made the Passover food ready.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">When it was time to eat, he sat down at the table and the apostles sat down with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">He said to them, I have wanted very much to eat this Passover Feast with you before my troubles come.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">I tell you this. I will not eat it again until the great feast in the kingdom of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">He took the cup and thanked God. He said, Take this. All of you drink from this.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">I tell you this. I will not drink from the fruit of the vine again until the kingdom of God comes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">He took some bread. He thanked God for it and broke it. He gave it to the disciples and said, This is my body, which is given for you. When you do this, then remember me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">In the same way he took the cup after they had eaten. He said, This cup is the new agreement made by my blood. It is given for you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">There is a man who will give me over to my enemies. His hand is here at the table with me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">The Son of Man will go on as it was planned for him. But the man who gives him over will have trouble!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">The disciples began to ask each other, Which of us will do this?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">They started to quarrel among themselves about which of them was the greatest person.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Jesus said to them, The kings of countries make their people obey them. Those who rule give themselves a good name.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">But it must not be so among you. The one who is greatest among you must be like the most unimportant. And the leader must be like one who helps others.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Which man is greater, the man who sits at the table or the man who helps him? Is it not the man who sits at the table? But I am like the man who helps you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">You have stayed with me through my troubles.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">My Father made me a ruler, and now I make you rulers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">You will eat and drink at my table in my kingdom. You will sit on chief chairs or thrones and judge the twelve tribes of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Simon, Simon, listen! Satan has asked to have all of you. He wants to shake you like grain with the cleaning fan.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">But I have talked to God about you, Simon, so that you will keep on believing in me. And when you come back, then help your brothers to be strong.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">Simon said, Lord, I will go with you, even to prison or to die.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Jesus said, I tell you this, Peter. This very day, before the cock calls, you will say three times that you do not know me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">Jesus said to them, When I sent you out to the towns, I told you not to carry a money bag, or a bag, or shoes. Did you ever need anything at that time? They said, No.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">He said, But this time, anyone who has money should take it and his bag too. Anyone who has no sword should sell his coat and buy one.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">The holy writings say, "He was counted as one of the bad people." And I tell you, that means me. And the things that are written about me must happen to me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">The disciples said, Look, Lord, here are two swords. And he answered, That is enough.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">Then Jesus went out of the room and went to the hill called the Mount of Olives where he often went. His disciples went with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">He said to them, Talk with God so that you will not do wrong.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">He went away from them about as far as a person can throw a stone. Then he kneeled down to talk with God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">He said, Father, if you will, take this cup away from me. But do not do what I want but what you want.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">Then an angel came to him from heaven and helped to make him strong.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">His heart was troubled very much. So he talked with God more than before. His sweat was like big drops of blood falling on the ground.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">He stopped talking with God and got up. He went to his disciples and found them sleeping because they were sad.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">He said to them, Why are you sleeping? Get up. Talk with God so that you will not do wrong.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">As Jesus was saying this, many men came. One of the twelve disciples, named Judas,  was leading the people. He came near Jesus to kiss him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">Jesus said to him, Judas, will you give over the Son of Man to his enemies with a kiss?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">The disciples around Jesus saw what was going to happen. They said, Lord, shall we fight with our swords?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">One of them hit the servant of the high priest and cut off his right ear.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="51">Jesus said, Just let me do this. And he touched the mans ear and healed him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="52">The chief priests, the captains of the temple, and the leaders of the people had come to catch Jesus. He said to them, Have you come to take me with swords and sticks, the way you catch a man who steals?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="53">I was with you every day in the temple. You did not try to catch me then. But this is your time now, the time of the power of darkness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="54">The men caught Jesus and took him away to the high priests house. Peter followed them far behind.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="55">They made a fire in the yard and sat around it. Peter sat down with them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="56">A woman saw Peter sitting by the fire. She looked at him and said, This man was with him also.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="57">But Peter said, Woman, I do not know him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="58">After a while, another person saw him and said, You are one of them also. But Peter said, Man, I am not.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="59">About an hour later another person said, Surely this man was with him. He comes from Galilee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="60">Peter said, Man, I do not know what you are talking about. And right then, while he was talking, the cock called.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="61">The Lord turned and looked at Peter. Then Peter remembered that the Lord had said to him, Before the cock calls in the morning, you will say three times that you do not know me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="62">Peter went out and cried very much.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="63">The men who guarded Jesus made fun of him and beat him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="64">They tied something over his eyes. Then they hit him in the face and said, Tell us if you know who hit you!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="65">And they said many other wrong things to him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="66">In the morning the leaders of the people, the chief priests and scribes met together. They took Jesus to their court.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="67">They said, If you are the Christ, tell us. Jesus said, If I tell you, you will not believe.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="68">And if I ask you anything, you will not answer.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="69">From this time on the Son of Man will sit beside God who has all power.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="70">They all said, Then are you the Son of God?" He said, Yes, I am.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="71">They said, We do not need any more proof against him. We ourselves have heard what he said.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="23">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Then all the people got up and took Jesus to Pilate.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">They began to make a complaint against him. They said, This man is leading our people to do wrong. He says we should not pay taxes to Caesar. He says that he is Christ, a King.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Then Pilate asked Jesus, Are you the King of the Jews?" Jesus answered, Yes, I am.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Pilate said to the chief priests and to the people, I find nothing wrong in this man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">But they said all the more, He troubles the people by his teaching. He has been teaching people in all the country of Judea. He began in Galilee and has come as far as this city.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">When Pilate heard this, he asked, Is this man from Galilee?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">When he knew that he came from Herods country, he sent him to Herod. Herod was in Jerusalem at that time.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">He was glad to see Jesus. He had heard about him. And he had wanted to see him for a long time. He was hoping that he would see Jesus do a big work.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">He asked Jesus many questions. But Jesus did not answer him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">The chief priests and the scribes stood near. They brought strong complaints against him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Then Herod and his soldiers laughed at Jesus and made fun of him. He dressed him up in very fine clothes and sent him back to Pilate.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Herod and Pilate became friends that day. Before that, they had hated each other.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Pilate then called the chief priests, and the rulers, and the people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">He said to them, You brought this man to me. You said he is leading your people to do wrong. I have asked questions here in front of you. I have found nothing wrong in this man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Herod did the same. He sent him back to us. This man has done nothing for which he should die.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">So I will beat him and let him go.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">At the feast Pilate always let one man go free.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">But they all shouted, Kill this man! Let Barabbas go free for us!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">(Barabbas had been put in prison because he led some people who had been fighting in the city. He had killed a man.)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Pilate talked to the people again. He wanted to let Jesus go free.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">But they shouted, Nail him to a cross! Nail him to a cross!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Pilate said to them the third time, Why, what wrong thing has he done? I have not found any wrong thing for which he should die. So I will beat him and let him go.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">But they shouted all the more loudly, saying, Nail him to a cross! And Pilate gave in to their shouting.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">So he said they could have it their way.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">He let the other man go free. (He was the one who had been put in prison because he fought and had killed a man. He was the one the people asked Pilate to let go free.) And Pilate did to Jesus what they wanted him to do.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">They took Jesus away. On the way, they caught a man who was coming in from the farms. His name was Simon. He was born in the country of Cyrene. They made him walk behind Jesus and carry his cross.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Many people followed him. Women cried and were sorry for him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">But Jesus turned to them and said, Daughters of Jerusalem, do not cry for me. But cry for yourselves and for your children.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">The time will come when people will say, "Happy are the women who have no children or who have never had a child."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Then people will begin to say to the big hills, "Fall on us." They will say to the small hills,  "Hide us."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">If this is what people do when the wood is new, what will they do when it is old?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">Two men were also led away to be killed with Jesus. They were bad men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">They came to the place called Calvary (the head bone.) There they nailed the two bad men to the crosses also. They put one man on the right side of Jesus and one man on the left side of him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Jesus said, Father, forgive them! They do not know what they are doing. The soldiers played a game to see how they should divide his clothes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">The people stood around watching. But the rulers made fun of him. They said, He saved other people. He should save himself if he is Gods Christ, Gods chosen one!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">The soldiers made fun of him. They came and brought him wine to drink.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">They said, If you are the King of the Jews, save yourself!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">The sign that was put above Jesus head said, This is the King of the Jews.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">One of the bad men who was hanging there said wrong things against Jesus. He said If you are the Christ, why do you not save yourself and us?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">But the other bad man told him to stop. He said, Do you not even fear God? You are being punished just as he is.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">It is right for us to be punished because we have done wrong things. But this man has done nothing bad.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">He said to Jesus, Lord, remember me when you become a King.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">And Jesus said to him, I tell you the truth. Today you will be with me in Gods garden of paradise.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">About noontime the whole land became dark and stayed dark for three hours.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">The sun did not shine. The big cloth that hung in the temple was torn into two pieces.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">Jesus called out loud, Father, I put my spirit into your hands! When he had said this, he died.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">The captain saw all this. Then he praised God. He said, Surely, this was a good man!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">Many people were around there to look on. When they saw what happened, they all went home beating their chests &lt;FI&gt;because they were sad&lt;Fi&gt; .</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">All Jesus friends and the women who had come with him from Galilee stood far away.  They saw all of this.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">There was a man named Joseph. He was a member of the court. He was a good man who lived the right way.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="51">He had not wanted the people to do what they did. He was looking for the kingdom of God. He was from a town of the Jews, called Arimathea.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="52">He went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="53">He took the body down from the cross. He wrapped it in a linen cloth and laid it in a grave cut in a rock. No one had ever been put in this grave.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="54">It was the day before the Sabbath. And it was almost time for the Sabbath to begin.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="55">Some women had come with Jesus from Galilee. They followed and saw the grave where his body was put.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="56">Then they went back and got things ready to put on his body. These things were spices that smelled very nice, and sweet kinds of oil. On the Sabbath day they rested as the law said they should.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="24">
      <VERS vnumber="1">On the first day of the week, early in the morning, the women went to the grave. They took with them the things they had made ready.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">They saw that the stone was rolled away from the grave.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">So they went in. But they did not see the body of the Lord Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">They were troubled about this. Then they saw two men standing near them. They were dressed in white clothes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">The women were afraid and bowed their faces down to the ground. The men said to them, Why do you look for a living person among dead people?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">He is not here. He has risen. Remember what he told you when he was still in Galilee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">He said that the Son of Man would be given over to bad men. He would be nailed to a cross, and he would rise on the third day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Then they remembered what he had said.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">They left the grave and went back. They told all these things to the eleven disciples and to all the other people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">The women who told these things to the apostles were Mary Magdalene, Joanna, Mary the mother of James, and the other women who were with them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">But Peter got up and ran to the grave. He bowed down and looked in. He saw the linen clothes lying there, but nothing more. Then he left, wondering about what had happened.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">That same day, two of the disciples were going to the town called Emmaus. It was about two hours walk from Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">They were talking together about all the things that had happened.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">While they were talking and asking each other questions, Jesus himself came and walked with them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">But even though they saw him, they did not know who he was.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Jesus asked them, What is this that you are talking about as you walk along looking so sad?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">One of them named Cleophas answered him. He said, Are you a stranger in Jerusalem and do not know what has happened there these last days?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Jesus said, What things?" They said, All that has happened to Jesus of Nazareth. He was a prophet of God. He had power to do big works and to teach the people. He was respected by God and all the people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Our chief priests and rulers gave him over to be punished by death, and they nailed him to a cross.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">But we were hoping that he was the one who would free the people of Israel. But that is not all. This is the third day since they did it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Some of our women told us things that surprised us. Early this morning they were at the grave.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">They did not find his body there. They came back and said that they saw angels. The angels told them that Jesus was living.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Some of us went to the grave. And they found everything just as the women said. But they did not see Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Then he said to them, You foolish men! Your hearts are slow to believe all that the prophets of God have said long ago.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Christ had to have this trouble and go to the place where he will be great, did he not?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Then he told them the meaning of all that Moses and all the prophets of God long ago had written about him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">They came near the village to which they were going. It looked as if he was going on further.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">But they begged him not to go further. They said, Stay with us. It will soon be night. The day is almost finished. So he went in to stay with them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">He sat down at the table with them. Then he took the bread and thanked God for it. He broke it and gave it to them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Then they saw who he was. They knew him. And then suddenly they could not see him any more.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">They said to each other, It was like a fire burning in our hearts when he talked to us on the road and told us the meaning of the holy writings!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">They got up right then and went back to Jerusalem. There they found the eleven disciples together. Some other people were with them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">These people said, The Lord has really risen! He came to Simon!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Then the men from Emmaus told them what had happened on the road. They told how they knew Jesus when he broke bread and gave it to them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">While they were telling them this, Jesus himself stood there with them. He said to them,  Peace to you!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">They were troubled and afraid. They thought they were seeing a spirit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">He said to them, Why are you troubled? Why do you wonder about these things in your hearts?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">Look at my hands and my feet. You can see that it is I myself. Touch me with your hands and see. A spirit does not have a body and bones as you see I have.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">They gave him a piece of cooked fish.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">He took the fish and ate it in front of them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">Then he said, I told you this while I was with you. I told you that things were written about me in the books of Moses, the Prophets, and the Psalms. And I told you that all of these things must come true.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">Then he taught them so that they understood the things in the holy writings.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">He said, It is written that the Christ must have trouble. On the third day he will rise from death.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">Men will talk in his name to people in all countries. They will tell them to stop their wrong ways and ask to be forgiven. They will begin in Jerusalem.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="46">I will send you what the Father has promised to give you. So wait in the city of Jerusalem until you have been given power from God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">Jesus led the disciples out as far as the town of Bethany. He put up his hands and blessed them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">While he was blessing them, he left them. He was taken up into heaven.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="1">
      <VERS vnumber="1">The Word already was, way back before anything began to be. The Word and God were together. The Word was God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Before anything began to be, the Word was there with God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">God made everything by the Word. Nothing has been made without him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Life was in the Word. That life was Light for people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">The Light shone where it was dark and the darkness did not stop the Light from shining.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">God sent a man named John.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">He came to talk about the Light, so that all people might believe in the Light by what he said.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">He himself was not that Light, but he was sent to talk about the Light.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">The true Light which gives light to every person who comes into the world.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">He, the Word, was in the world. Yes, he even made the world. And yet the world did not know him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">He came into the world that was his own, but his own people did not receive him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">But there were people who did believe in his name. They did receive him. He gave all those who received him and believed him the right to become children of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">They were born into Gods family by God. That is, they were not born into his family in the way a person is born into this world. It was not by any persons will.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">The Word became man and he lived among us. We saw with our own eyes that he is great. He is great the way God the Father made his only Son great. We saw that he is full of loving kindness and truth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">John talked about him. He called out saying, Here is the man I told you about. I said that the one who is coming after me is greater than I am, because he lived before I lived.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">He was full of loving kindness, and we have all received so much kindness from him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Moses gave the law, but Jesus Christ gave this loving kindness and truth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">No one has ever seen God. But his only Son is very near to his Fathers heart. He has told us plainly about God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">The leaders of the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem. They asked John, Who are you? John told them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">He did not hide the truth, but he told people plainly. He said, I am not the Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">So they asked him, Well then, are you Elijah? He answered, No, I am not. They asked,  Are you the Prophet? He answered, No.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Then those priests said, Who are you? We want to give an answer to the people who sent us. What do you say about yourself?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">John said, I am a voice calling in the desert, "Make the road straight for the Lord." This is what was said by Isaiah, the prophet of God long ago.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">It was the Pharisees who had sent these people to John.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">So they asked him, If you are not the Christ, nor Elijah, nor the Prophet, why then are you baptizing?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">John answered, I baptize people in water. But there is a man standing among you whom you do not know.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">He is the one coming after me who is greater than I am. I am not even good enough to untie his shoe strings.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">The place where John was baptizing was Bethany on the other side of the Jordan River.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">The next day John saw Jesus coming to him. Look, said John. See Gods special Lamb!  He takes away the wrong ways of the world.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Here is the man I told you about. I said that the one who is coming after me is greater than I am, because he lived before I lived.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">I myself did not know who he was. But I came and baptized people in water so that the people of Israel would know who he was.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">John also said, I saw the Spirit coming from the sky. He came down on him like a dove.  It stayed on him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">I myself did not know who he was. But he who sent me to baptize people in water told me. He said, "You will see the Spirit coming from the sky on a man. That man will baptize people in the Holy Spirit."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">I saw the Spirit coming on him, and I have told you. This man is the Son of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">The next day, John was standing with two of his followers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">Jesus walked by. When John saw him, he said, Look, see Gods Lamb!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">The two followers heard what John said, so they went after Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">Jesus turned. He saw them coming after him. He said to them, What are you looking for? They said, Teacher, where do you live?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">Jesus said, Come and see. They went and saw the place where Jesus was staying. The time was about four oclock in the afternoon. They stayed with Jesus the rest of the day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">Andrew was one of those two followers of John who heard John speak and went after Jesus. He was Simon Peters brother.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">The first thing Andrew did then was to find his brother Simon. He said, We have found the Messiah! (Messiah means the Christ, the messenger of God.)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">Andrew brought Simon to Jesus. Jesus looked at him and said, You are Simon, the son of John. Your name will be Cephas. (Cephas means Peter, a rock or stone.)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">The next day Jesus said, I will go to Galilee. He found Philip and said to him, Come with me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">Philip was from the town of Bethsaida. Andrew and Peter were also from that town.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">Philip went to find Nathanael. He said We have found the man about whom Moses wrote in the books of the law. The prophets also wrote about him. He is Jesus, from Nazareth. He is the son of Joseph.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">Nathanael said, From Nazareth? Can any good thing come from there? Philip said,  Come and see for yourself.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him. He said, Here is a man who is truly of Israel. He does not fool people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">Nathanael asked, How do you know me? Jesus answered, I saw you when you were under the fig tree. That was before Philip called you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">Nathanael said, Teacher, you are the Son of God. You are the King of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">Jesus answered, I told you that I saw you under the fig tree. Is that why you believe in me now? You will see more wonderful things than that!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="51">I tell you the truth, said Jesus. You will see heaven open. You will see Gods angels going up and down to the Son of Man.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="2">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Two days later there was a wedding in the town of Cana in the country of Galilee. Jesus  mother was there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Jesus and his disciples were also asked to the wedding.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">The people needed more wine. Then Jesus mother said to him, They have no wine.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Jesus said, Woman, why are you telling me about it? It is not yet the time for me to do something.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">His mother said to the servants, Do all that he tells you to do.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Six very large water pots made of stone were standing there. The pots were there because the Jews had a certain law about washing themselves.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Jesus said, Fill the pots with water. So they filled them to the very top.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Jesus said, Now take some out. Carry it to the one in charge of the feast. They did what he said.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">The man in charge of the feast tasted the water that was now turned into wine. He did not know where it came from, but the servants who drew the water knew. When the man had tasted it, he called the man who was being married.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">He said, Other people give the good wine at the beginning of the feast. When people have had all they want, then they give the wine which is not so good. But you have kept the good wine until now.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">This was the first big work that Jesus did. It was in Cana in Galilee. He showed that he was great. And his disciples believed in him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">After this he went to the town called Capernaum. His mother, his brothers, and his disciples also went with him. They stayed there for a few days.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">The time for the Passover Feast of the Jews was near. So Jesus went to Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">In the temple he found people buying and selling things. They were selling cows, sheep,  and doves. Others were sitting at tables changing money for the people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Jesus tied some pieces of cord together to make a whip. Then he drove out all the people who were buying and selling in the temple. And he drove out the sheep and the cows. He threw down the tables of the money changers and their money.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">He said to the people who sold doves, Take these things out of here. Do not make my Fathers house into a market place.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">His disciples remembered that Gods word says, My love for your house is like a fire burning in me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">The leaders of the Jews said to Jesus, Who gave you the right to do this? What big work will prove it to us?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Jesus answered them, Break down this temple and in three days I will raise it up.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">The Jewish leaders said, It took forty-six years to build this temple. Do you say you will raise it in three days?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">But Jesus was talking about the temple which was his body.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">After Jesus died and had been raised from death, the disciples remembered that he had said this to them. Then they believed what the holy writings say. They also believed what Jesus had said to them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Many people believed in Jesus name when he was in Jerusalem at the Passover Feast.  They believed in him because they saw the big works he did.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">But Jesus would not trust himself to them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">He knew what all people are like. He did not need anyone to tell him about any person,  because he knew what was in a persons heart.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="3">
      <VERS vnumber="1">There was a man named Nicodemus. He was a Pharisee, a ruler and leader of the Jews.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">One night Nicodemus came to Jesus. He said, Master, we know you are a teacher sent by God. We know this because no person could do the big works you are doing if God did not help him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Jesus said, I tell you the truth. No person can see Gods kingdom if he is not born again.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Nicodemus said, How can a man be born when he is old? Can he go inside of his mother again and be born?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Jesus said, I tell you the truth. This new birth is by water and by the Spirit. No person can enter Gods kingdom if he has not been born that way.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">That which is born of a person is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">You must not be surprised when I say, "You must be born again."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">The wind blows where it wants to blow. You can hear the sound of it. But you do not know where it comes from, and you do not know where it goes. It is the same way with everyone who is born of the Spirit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Nicodemus asked Jesus, How can such things be?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Jesus answered, Are you a teacher of the people of Israel and you do not know this?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">I tell you the truth. We know what we are talking about. We talk about the things we have seen. But you will not believe what we tell you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">You do not believe what I have told you about things on earth. So how will you believe if I tell you about things in heaven?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">No one has ever gone up to heaven-only the One who came down from heaven. That One is the Son of Man who is in heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Moses lifted up a snake on a piece of wood in the desert. So the Son of Man must be lifted up.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Then everyone who believes in him will not die, but will live for ever.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">God loved the world so very, very much that he gave his only Son. Because he did that,  everyone who believes in him will not lose his life, but will live for ever.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">God did not send his Son into the world to judge the world. He sent him to save the world.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Everyone who believes in the Son will not be judged. But everyone who does not believe in him is judged already, because he does not believe in the name of Gods only Son.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Light came into the world. But people wanted to be in the dark because they did wrong things. They did not want the light. That is why they are judged.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Everyone who does wrong things hates light. He does not come to the light because he is afraid people will see what he does and will say it is bad.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">But everyone who does what is right comes to the light. He wants people to see that God helps him to do what is right.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">After this, Jesus and his disciples came into the country of Judea. Jesus stayed there with them and baptized people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">John was also baptizing people in the river at Aenon, near the town of Salim. There was much water. People came to him and were baptized.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">This was before John was put in prison.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Johns disciples and the leaders of the Jews were talking about how to be clean, the way God wants us to be clean.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">They came to John and said, Teacher, there was a man with you on the other side of the Jordan River. You were telling people about him. Now he himself is baptizing and all the people are going to him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">John answered, A man cannot get anything unless God in heaven gives it to him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">You yourselves heard what I said. I am not the Christ but I have been sent ahead of the Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">The wife belongs to the man who has married her. The mans best friend may stand and listen. And when he hears what that man says, he is very glad for him. So what I hear makes me very glad in the same way.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">He must become more and more great, but I must become less and less great.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">The one who comes from heaven is greater than all other people. The one who is of the earth talks about things on earth. So the one who comes from heaven is greater than all.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">He tells what he has seen and heard, but no one wants to believe what he says.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">If a person believes what the one from heaven says, then he also says God is true.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">The one God sent speaks the words of God. God does not give him the Spirit little by little, but he gives the Spirit in full.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">The Father loves his Son and has put everything in his hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">He who believes in the Son will live for ever. He who does not believe in the Son will not live. God will be very angry with him for ever.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="4">
      <VERS vnumber="1">The Pharisees heard that Jesus was getting people to follow him and was baptizing them.  (Jesus disciples baptized them, not he himself.) He now had more followers than John.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">The Lord knew that they had heard about it. So he left Judea and went back to Galilee again.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">He had to pass through the country of Samaria.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">He came to a town in Samaria called Sychar. It was near the field that Jacob gave to his son Joseph.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Jacobs well was there. Jesus was very tired from walking on the road. So he sat down by the well. It was about midday.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">A woman from Samaria came to the well to draw water. Jesus said, Please give me a drink of water.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">His disciples had gone into the town to buy some food.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">The woman said to Jesus, Why do you ask me for a drink of water? You are a Jew and I am from Samaria. (The Jews are not friends with the people of Samaria.)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Jesus answered her, You do not know what God gives people. And you do not know who is asking you for a drink. If you knew him, then it is you who would have asked for a drink of water. He would give you living water.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">The woman said, Sir, you have nothing to draw with. The well is deep. Where do you get that living water?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Are you greater than our father Jacob who gave us this well? He drank water from this well, also his children and cattle.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Jesus answered her, Anyone who drinks this water will be thirsty again.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">But anyone who drinks the water that I will give him will never be thirsty. The water I give him will become a well inside of him that will never be dry. It will give him life for ever.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">The woman said, Sir, give me this water. Then I will never be thirsty again. I will not need to come here to draw water.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Jesus said, Go, call your husband, then come here.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">She said, I have no husband. Jesus said, You say, "I have no husband." That is true.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">You have had five husbands, but the man you are living with now is not your husband.  You have told the truth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">The woman said, Sir, this shows me you are a prophet of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Our fathers came to this mountain to worship God. But you people say Jerusalem is the place people must go to worship him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Jesus said, Woman, believe what I say. The time is coming when you will not come to this mountain or to Jerusalem to worship my Father.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">You worship one whom you do not know. But we know whom we worship. The Saviour will come of the Jews.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">But the time is coming, yes, the time is here already, when those who worship God will worship him in spirit and in a true way. My Father is looking for that kind of people to worship him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">God is Spirit. Those who worship him must do so in spirit and in a true way.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">The woman said to Jesus, I know that Messiah is coming. His name is Christ. When he comes he will tell us everything.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Jesus said to her, I who am talking to you am he.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">When Jesus had said this, his disciples came back. They were surprised to hear him talking to a woman. But not one of them asked, What do you want? or, Why are you talking to her?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">The woman left her water-pot and went back to the town.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">She said to the people, Come, I will show you a man who has told me everything I have done. Can this be the Christ?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">The people left the town and went to him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">While they were on the way coming to Jesus, the disciples asked him, Teacher, will you please eat.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Jesus said to them, I have food that you do not know about.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">So the disciples asked one another, Has anyone brought him food to eat?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">Jesus said to them, My food is to obey the one who sent me and to finish his work.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Do you not say, "In four months it will be harvest time"? Listen, I say. Look up and see the fields. The harvest is ready to cut now.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">The one who gathers the harvest receives a reward for it. He gathers a harvest that will live for ever. Then the one who sows and the one who gathers will both be happy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">This saying is true here: "One sows and another gathers."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">I sent you to gather what you did not help to plant. Other people have worked hard and you have been helped through their work.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">Many of the people of the town believed in Jesus because of what the woman told them.  She said, He told me everything I have done.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">When the people from Samaria came, they begged him to stay with them. So he stayed with them for two days.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">Many more people believed in Jesus because of his own word.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">They said to the woman, Now we believe, not because of what you told us, but because of what he himself has told us. We know it is true. This is the Saviour of the world.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">Two days after this, Jesus left Samaria and went to Galilee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">Jesus himself said, No prophet is honoured by the people in his own country.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">When he came to Galilee, the people of that country were glad to see him. They had seen all the things he did when he was at the feast in Jerusalem. They had been at the feast also.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">So Jesus came back to the town of Cana in Galilee. That was the place where he had changed water into wine. One of the kings officers was there. His son was sick in the town of Capernaum.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">He heard that Jesus had come from Judea to Galilee, and he went to Jesus and said, I beg you, come and heal my son. He is dying.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">Jesus said to him, If you do not see some signs and big works, then you will not believe.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">The officer said, Sir, I beg you. Come right away before my son dies.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">Jesus said, Go home. Your son will not die. The man believed what Jesus said and went home.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">On the way, his servants met him. They said, Your son is living.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="51">He asked, What time did he begin to get well? They said, Yesterday at one hour after midday the fever left him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="52">The father knew that was the time when Jesus said to him Your son will not die. So he and all his family believed in Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="53">This was the second big work that Jesus did after he came back from Judea to Galilee.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="5">
      <VERS vnumber="1">After that, the Jews had a feast and Jesus went to Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">In Jerusalem, near the Sheep Gate, there is a wide water hole. The Jews called this water hole Bethesda. It had five places with roofs for people to stand under.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Many sick people were lying on these places. Some of them were blind. Some were lame. Some were very thin and stiff so that they could not move by themselves. All of them were waiting for the water to move.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">An angel came down into the water at a certain time and made it move. The first person who stepped into the water when it moved was healed of any sickness that he had.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">A man was there who had been sick for thirty eight years.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Jesus saw the man lying there. He knew that he had been sick for a long time. He said to him, Do you want to be healed?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">The sick man said to him, Sir, I have no man to put me into the water when it moves.  While I am trying to get in, some other person comes and gets in before me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Jesus said, Get up. Take up your bed and walk!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">The man was healed right away. He took up his bed and walked. This happened on the Sabbath day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">So the leaders of the Jews talked to the man who was healed. They said, It is the Sabbath day. It is not right for you to carry your bed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">But he answered them, The man who healed me said to me, "Take up your bed and walk."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">They asked him, Who is the man who told you to take up your bed and walk?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">The man who was healed said, I do not know who he is. Many people were at the place and Jesus had gone away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">After that, Jesus saw the man in the temple. He said to him, See, you are healed. Do no more wrong things. If you do, something worse may happen to you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">The man went away and told the leaders of the Jews that it was Jesus who had healed him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">The Jewish leaders made trouble for Jesus because he did this on the Sabbath day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">But Jesus answered them, My Father is still working and I am working also.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">This was why the leaders of the Jews tried much more to kill Jesus. He had broken the law of the Sabbath day. And also he called God his Father. In that way, he was making himself equal with God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Jesus said to them, l tell you the truth. The Son cannot do anything alone. He sees what his Father is doing and he does the same.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">My Father loves his Son. He shows him all that he himself is doing. He will show his Son bigger works than these so that you may be surprised.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">My Father raises people who were dead, and gives them life. So his Son gives life to anyone he wants to.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">My Father judges no one, but he has made his Son to be the judge of everything.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">He did this so that all people would respect the Son, just as they respect his Father. My Father has sent his Son. Anyone who does not respect his Son does not respect the Father.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">I tell you the truth. The person who hears what I say and believes in him that sent me will live for ever. He will not be judged. He has already passed from death to life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">I tell you the truth. The time is coming. Yes, the time is here when the dead people will hear the voice of the Son of God. Those who hear his voice will live.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">My Father has life in himself. And so he has made his Son to have life in himself.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">He has given his Son power also to judge because he is the Son of Man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Do not be surprised at what I say. The time is coming when all who are in the graves will hear his voice.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">They will come out of the graves. Those who have done what is good will come out to live. But those who have done what is wrong will come out to be punished.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">I have no right to do anything myself. I judge the way I am told to judge. The way I judge people is right. I do not do what I myself want to do, but I do what my Father wants me to do. He sent me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">If I talk about myself, then what I say is not true.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">But someone else also speaks about me. I know what he says about me is true.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">You sent someone to John and he has told you the truth about me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">I do not need to listen to what a person says about me. But I tell you this so that you may be saved.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">John was a light burning and shining. For a while you were happy to be in his light.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">But I have something greater than John to talk for me. It is the works that I do. My Father has given me works to finish. The works that I do tell that he sent me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">And my Father who sent me has himself talked about me. You have never heard him speak and you do not know what he is like.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">The word he talks is not in your hearts, because you do not believe the one he sent to you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">You read holy writings carefully. You think that there you will find out how to live for ever. In the same writings you will read about me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">And yet you will not come to me for that life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">I do not want people to call me great.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">But I know that you do not love God in your hearts.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">I have come in my Fathers name, but you will not receive me. If another person comes in his own name, then you will receive him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">How can you believe? You are always calling each other great, but you do not want the only God to make you great.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">Do not think that I will carry a complaint against you to my Father. Moses has already carried the complaint against you. He is the very one you trust.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">If you really believed Moses, you would believe me too, because he wrote about me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">But if you do not believe what he wrote, how will you believe what I say?</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="6">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Then Jesus crossed over the sea of Galilee. (Another name for this sea was Tiberias.)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Many people followed him because they saw the big works he had done in healing the sick people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Jesus went up on a hill and sat down with his disciples.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">The time for the Passover Feast of the Jews was near.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">When Jesus looked up, he saw many people coming to him. He said to Philip, Where shall we buy food for these people to eat?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Jesus knew what he himself would do, but he said this to see what Philip would do.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Philip answered him, It would take nearly a years wages to buy enough food for them,  even if each one gets only a little.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">One of Jesus disciples, Andrew, the brother of Simon Peter, talked to Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">He said, A boy here has five loaves of bread and two small fish. But what can that little bit of food do for so many people?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Jesus said, Tell the people to sit down. Much grass was there. The number of men who sat down was about five thousand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Then Jesus took the bread and thanked God for it. He gave it to the disciples and they divided it among those who were sitting. He did the same thing with the fish. The people had all they wanted.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">When they had eaten enough, he said to his disciples, Gather up all the pieces that are left so that nothing will be lost.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">They gathered all the pieces of the five loaves. Twelve baskets full were left over after all the people had eaten enough.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">When those men saw the big work that Jesus did, they said, Truly, this is the Prophet that is to come into the world.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">The people wanted to take Jesus by force to make him a king. When he saw this, he left again and went on the hill by himself.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">In the evening his disciples went down to the lake &lt;FI&gt;called the sea of Galilee&lt;Fi&gt; .</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">They got in a boat and crossed over the sea toward the town of Capernaum. It was dark,  but Jesus had not come back to them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">A strong wind was blowing. It made the water very rough.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">They rowed the boat into the middle of the lake. Then they saw Jesus walking on the water. He came close to the boat. They were afraid.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">But Jesus said to them, It is I. Do not fear.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Then they were glad to take him into the boat. Then at once the boat reached the land to which they were going.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">The people who stayed back on the land had seen one boat only. They had seen the disciples get in it and go away without Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">But there were some other boats from Tiberias. It was near the place where they had eaten bread, after the Lord had thanked God for it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">The next day the people saw that Jesus and his disciples were not there. Then they went to Capernaum in boats to look for Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">When they found Jesus on the other side of the lake, they said, Teacher, when did you get here?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Jesus said, I tell you the truth. You do not want me because you saw the big works I did,  but you want me because you ate all the bread you wanted.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Do not work for the food that spoils, but work for the food that will never spoil, the food that will give you life for ever. The Son of Man will give you that food. God my Father has chosen him to do that.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">They asked him, What works does God ask us to do?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Jesus answered them, The work that God asks you to do is to believe in the one whom he has sent.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">They said, What big work will you do? We want to see it and believe you. What work are you are going to do?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Our fathers ate bread in the wilderness. The holy writings say, "He gave them bread from heaven to eat." Jesus said to them, I tell you the truth. It was not Moses who gave you that bread from heaven. But my Father gives you true bread from heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">He who comes down from heaven is the bread that God gives. He is the one who gives life to the world.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">They said to him, Lord, give us this bread always!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">Jesus said, I am the bread that gives life. Anyone who comes to me will never be hungry.  Anyone who believes in me will never be thirsty.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">But I said to you that you have seen me, and yet you will not believe in me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">All those whom my Father gives me, they will come to me. I will never turn anyone away who comes to me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">I did not come down from heaven to do what I myself want to do. I came to do what the one who sent me wants me to do.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">My Father sent me. He wants me to lose nothing that he has given me. And he wants me to raise it up on the last day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">My Father wants everyone who sees his Son and believes in him to live for ever. I will raise him up on the last day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">The leaders of the Jews did not like Jesus to say, I am the bread that has come down from heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">They said, Is he not Josephs son, Jesus? We know his father and mother. How can he say, "I have come down from heaven"?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">Jesus answered them, There is no need for you to talk against me to each other.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">No one can come to me if my Father does not draw him. He sent me. I myself will raise up the one who comes to me. I will bring him back to life on the last day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">The prophets wrote, "God will teach all people." So then, every person who listens to his words and learns what he says, he will come to me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">But no person has seen my Father. The only one who has seen him is the one who comes from God. He has seen my Father.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">I tell you the truth. The person who believes in me will live for ever.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">I am the bread that gives life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">Your fathers ate bread in the desert long ago, but they died.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">Here is bread that comes down from heaven. The person who eats this bread will never die.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="51">I am the bread that gives life. I came down from heaven. If anyone eats this bread, he will live for ever. I will give bread so that the world may live. I am that bread.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="52">The leaders of the Jews began to quarrel with each other about what Jesus said. They said, How can he give us himself to eat?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="53">Jesus said, I tell you the truth. If you do not eat the Son of Man and do not drink his blood, you will not have life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="54">Anyone who eats me and drinks my blood will live for ever. I will raise him up at the last day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="55">I am real food, and my blood is real drink.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="56">Anyone who eats me and drinks my blood is in me and I in him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="57">My Father is living. He sent me. I have my life from him. In the same way, the person who eats of me will live because of me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="58">This bread which came down from heaven is not like the bread that your fathers ate.  They ate bread but they died. Anyone who eats this bread from heaven will live for ever.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="59">Jesus was in the meeting house in Capernaum when he was teaching people these things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="60">Many of his disciples heard it. They said, This is a hard teaching. Who can listen to it?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="61">But Jesus knew that his disciples did not like what he said. He asked, Is this hard for you?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="62">What would you do if you saw the Son of Man go up to the place where he came from?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="63">It is the Spirit that gives life. The flesh does not help. The words I say to you are Spirit and life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="64">But even so, some of you do not believe me. Jesus knew right from the beginning which ones of them would not believe. He knew who was going to give him over to people who hated him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="65">Then Jesus said, That is why I said to you, "No one can come to me unless my Father lets him come."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="66">After that, many of the followers of Jesus left him and stopped travelling around with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="67">Jesus said to the twelve disciples, Will you also leave me?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="68">Simon Peter answered, Lord, to whom shall we go? It is you who has told us how we may live for ever.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="69">We believe now, and we know it is true. You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="70">Jesus said to them, Did I not choose you twelve? And one of you is a devil!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="71">Jesus was talking about Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot. Judas was the one who was going to give him over to people who hated him. Judas was one of these twelve disciples.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="7">
      <VERS vnumber="1">After this, Jesus travelled around in Galilee. He would not travel around in Judea because the leaders of the Jews wanted to kill him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Every year the Jews had a feast to remember the time when their fathers lived in tents in the desert. The time was near for that feast.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Jesus brothers said to him, Go away from here to Judea. Let your disciples also see the work you are doing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">When a person wants people to know about him, he does not hide what he is doing. If you are doing these big things, let the world see you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Even his brothers did not believe in Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Jesus said to them, It is not yet the time for me to go. But you may go any time you want to.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">The people of the world cannot hate you. But they hate me because I say what they do is wrong.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Go to the feast yourselves. I am not going to the feast until it is the right time for me to go.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">He said this to them and stayed in Galilee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">After his brothers went to the feast, Jesus went also. He did not go with the other people,  but he went by himself.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">The leaders of the Jews at the feast tried to find him. They said, Where is he?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">People were talking among themselves about Jesus. Some said, He is a good man.  Others said, No. He is leading people to do wrong things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">But they were afraid of the Jewish leaders, so no one talked about him out in the open.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">When the feast was half finished, Jesus went to the temple and taught the people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">The Jews were very much surprised. How can this man know books? He never went to school.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Jesus answered the people, I am not teaching you my teaching. It is the teaching of the one who sent me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">If any man wants to do what God wants him to do, he will know the teaching. He will know if it is Gods teaching or if I am speaking from my own mind.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">The person who speaks from his own mind only wants to be great himself. But the person whom God has sent wants to show that God is great. That person is true. He is not a bad man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Did not Moses give you the law? Not one of you is keeping the law. Why are you trying to kill me?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">The people answered Jesus, A bad spirit is in you! Who is trying to kill you?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Jesus answered them, I have done one thing. You are all surprised about it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Moses gave you the law of circumcision. You obey the law, not because it came from Moses, but because it came from the fathers long ago. You circumcise a baby boy on the Sabbath day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">You do it on the Sabbath day so that you will not break the law of Moses. If you do that,  then why are you angry with me because I healed a man on the Sabbath day?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Do not judge by what you see, but judge in the right way.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Some people from Jerusalem said, Is not this the person they are trying to kill?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">See, he does not fear to speak and yet they say nothing to him! Do the rulers really know that this man is the Christ?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">But we know where this man comes from. When the Christ comes, no one will know where he comes from.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Jesus was teaching in the temple. He spoke loudly saying, You know me and you know where I come from. I have not come in my own power. The one who sent me is true. He is the one you do not know.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">I know him because I came from him. He sent me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Then the people wanted to catch him. But no one put a hand on him. It was not yet the time for that.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Many of the people believed in Jesus. They said, When Christ comes, will he do greater works than this man has done?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">The Pharisees heard what the people said about him. The chief priests and the Pharisees sent soldiers to catch him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">Jesus said, I will stay with you a short time longer. Then I will go back to him who sent me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">You will look for me, but you will not find me. You will not be able to go to the place where I will be.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">The Jews said to one another, Where will he go that we cannot find him? Will he go to our people who are living in other countries? Will he teach them?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">What does he mean by this: "You will look for me and will not find me. You will not be able to go to the place where I will be"?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">The last day of the feast was a big day. On that day Jesus stood up and shouted, If anyone is thirsty, he may come to me and drink.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">If anyone believes in me, the holy writings say, "Rivers of water that give life will flow out of his heart."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">This is what Jesus meant: those who believe in him would receive the Spirit. At that time no one had received the Holy Spirit because Jesus had not yet been lifted up to heaven</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">When some of the people heard this they said, Truly, this is the Prophet.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">Other people said, This is the Christ. But some said, The Christ will not come from Galilee. Shall Christ come out of Galilee?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">Do not the holy writings say that Christ will be of Davids family? Will he not come from Bethlehem where David lived?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">The people did not all say the same thing about him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">Some of them wanted to catch Jesus, but no one put hands on him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">The soldiers came back to the chief priests and the Pharisees. They asked the soldiers,  Why did you not bring him?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">The soldiers replied, No person has ever talked like he does!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">The Pharisees said, Has he fooled you also?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">None of the rulers and none of the Pharisees have believed on him, have they?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">These poor people do not know the law. They will die!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">Nicodemus, the man who came to Jesus by night, was one of them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="51">He said, Is it right to judge any man by our law before we hear him and learn what he has done?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="52">They answered him, Are you from Galilee also? Study what is written. You will see that no prophet is to come from Galilee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="53">Then every one of them went home.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="8">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Then Jesus went to the hill called the Mount of Olives.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Early the next morning he came again to the temple. All the people came to him. He sat down and taught them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">The scribes and the Pharisees brought a woman to Jesus. They had caught her having sex with a man who was not her husband. They made the woman stand in front of them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">They said, Teacher, this woman has committed adultery. She was caught doing it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">The law of Moses tells us that the people who do that should be killed with stones. What do you say?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">They said this to see what Jesus would do, because they wanted to find something wrong with him. Jesus bent down and wrote on the ground with his finger.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">They kept on asking him. He stood up and said to them, The one among you who has never done any wrong thing may throw the first stone at her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And Jesus bent down again and wrote on the ground.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">When the people heard what he said, they went out, one by one. The oldest one went out first. Jesus was left alone with the woman in front of him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Jesus looked up and said to her, Woman, where are the people? Has no one judged you?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">She said, No one, Sir. Jesus said, I also do not judge you. Go, and do no wrong thing again.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Then Jesus talked to the people in the temple. He said, I am the Light of the world. The one who comes with me will never walk in the dark, but he will have light that gives life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">The Pharisees said, You are talking about yourself. What you say is not true.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Jesus said to them, Even if I do talk about myself, what I say is true. I know where I come from and I know where I am going. But you do not know where I came from, or where I am going.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">You judge in the way people judge matters. I do not judge any person.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">But even if I do judge, I judge right. I am not alone. My Father who sent me is with me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Even in your law it says that when two people say the same thing, it is true.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">I talk about myself, and my Father who sent me talks about me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">They asked him, Where is your Father? He said, You do not know me and you do not know my Father. If you knew me, you would know my Father also.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">When Jesus said these words he was teaching in the temple. He was in the place where the money is kept. No one caught him because it was not yet his time.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Jesus talked to them again. He said, I am going away. You will try to find me and will die doing wrong things. You cannot come where I am going.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Then the Jews said, Will he kill himself? He says, "You cannot come where I am going."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Jesus said to them, You are from below. I am from above. You belong to this world. I do not belong to this world.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">That is why I said, "You will die doing wrong things." If you do not believe that I am who I said I am, then you will die doing wrong things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">They said to him, Who are you? Jesus answered, I am what I told you from the beginning.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">I have many things to say to you and to judge you in many things. But he who sent me is true. I tell the world what he has told me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">The people did not understand that Jesus was talking to them about his Father.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">So Jesus said, When you have lifted up the Son of Man, then you will know that I am he.  You will know that I do nothing by my own power, but I talk the way my Father taught me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">He who sent me is with me always. I always do what he wants me to do.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Many people believed in Jesus while he was talking this way.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Jesus said to the Jews who believed in him, If you obey my word, you are truly my disciples.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">And you will understand the truth and the truth will make you free.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">They said to him, We are Abrahams children. We have always been free. Why do you say to us, "You will be free"?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Jesus answered them, I tell you the truth. People who do wrong things are not free.  They become a slave of the wrong things they do.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">A slave does not belong to the family for ever. But a son belongs for ever.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">So if the Son makes you free, you will be truly free.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">I know that you come from Abraham. But you want to kill me because you do not like what I tell you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">I tell you about the things that I have seen where my Father is, and you do what you have seen your father do.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">They answered him, Abraham is our father. Jesus said, If you were Abrahams children, you would do what Abraham did.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">But you want to kill me because I told you the truth which I learned from God. Abraham did not do that.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">You are doing your fathers work. Then they said to him, We were not born of an unmarried woman. God is the Father of us all.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">Jesus said to them, If God were your Father you would love me, because I have come from God. I did not come by my own power. God sent me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">Why do you not understand what I say? I will tell you why. It is because you do not want to understand it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">The bad spirit, the devil, is your real father. You gladly do the wrong things he wants you to do. From the beginning he killed people. He has nothing to do with what is true.  His way is to tell lies. He himself is a liar and all lying comes from him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">You do not believe me because I tell you what is true.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">Which one of you can prove that what I have done is bad? I tell you what is true. Why then do you not believe me?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">The person who comes from God listens to what God says. You do not come from God.  That is why you do not listen to me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">The leaders of the Jews answered him, We say what is true. We say that you come from Samaria. And we say that a bad spirit is in you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">Jesus said, I have no bad spirit in me. I respect my Father but you do not respect me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">I do not want to make myself great. There is one who makes me great. He judges the matter.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="51">I tell you the truth. If anyone obeys my word, he will never die.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="52">The leaders of the Jews said to him, Now we know it is true that a bad spirit is in you.  Abraham died. So did the prophets. And yet you say, "If anyone obeys my word, he will never die."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="53">Are you greater than our father Abraham and the prophets of God who died long ago?  Who do you make yourself out to be?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="54">Jesus answered, If I make myself great, then I am not great. But my Father makes me great. You say he is your God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="55">But you do not know God. I know him. If I say, "I do not know him," I am a liar, just as you people are. But I know him and I obey his word.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="56">Your father Abraham was glad that he would see my coming. He did see it and he was very glad.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="57">The Jewish leaders said to him, You are not fifty years old yet. How could Abraham see you?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="58">Jesus answered, I tell you the truth. I already was before Abraham was born.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="59">Then they picked up stones to throw at him. But Jesus got out of their way. He left the temple and they did not know where he went.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="9">
      <VERS vnumber="1">On his way out of the temple Jesus saw a man who had been born blind.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">His disciples asked Jesus, Master, was this man born blind because of the wrong things he did, or was it the wrong things his parents did?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Jesus answered, It was not that he or his parents did any wrong thing. But it was so that people would see what God will do in him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">There is one who has sent me. I must do his work while it is still daylight. Night is coming. Then it will be too dark to work.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">As long as I am in the world, I am the Light of the world.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">When Jesus had said this, he spat on the ground. Then he put some of the wet dirt on the mans eyes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And he said, Go. wash your eyes in that water hole called Siloam. (Siloam means Sent.)  The man went and washed his eyes. After that, he was able to see.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">His neighbours and other people had seen him when he was blind. They said, Is not this the same man who used to sit here and beg?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Some people said, Yes, this is the same man. Others said, He is like that man. But the man himself said, I am that man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">They asked him, How is it that you can see now?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">He answered them, That man whose name is Jesus made some mud. He rubbed it on my eyes and told me to go and wash them in the water hole Siloam. And when I had washed my eyes, I could see.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Where is the man? they asked. He said, I do not know.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">They brought to the Pharisees the man who had been blind.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">The day Jesus made the mud and healed the man was the Sabbath day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Then the Pharisees also asked the man, How is it that you can see now? He answered them, The man put mud on my eyes. I washed my eyes and now I can see.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Then some of the Pharisees said, This man is not from God. He does not obey the Sabbath day law. The others said, But how can a bad man do such a big work? So the Pharisees did not agree together in what they thought about Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Then they asked the man who had been born blind, What do you say about the man who healed you? He answered, I say he is a prophet from God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">But the leaders of the Jews did not really believe what they heard about the man. They did not believe that first he had been blind and now was able to see. So they called the parents of the man who could now see.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Tell us, they said. Is this your son who you say was born blind? How is it that now he can see?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">The parents answered, We know that this is our son. And we know that he was born blind.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">But we do not know how it is that he can now see. We do not know who healed him.  Ask him. He is old enough to talk for himself.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">The parents said this because they were afraid of the Jewish leaders. They knew that the leaders of the Jews had already agreed that if anyone said Jesus is the Christ, they would be put out of the meeting place.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">That is why the parents said, He is old enough to talk for himself. Ask him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Then again they called the man who had been blind. They said to him, You must praise God for this. We know that the man who healed you is a bad man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">He answered them, I do not know if he is a bad man or not. But one thing I do know. I know that first I was blind, but now I can see.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Then they said to him again, What did he do to you? How did he heal you?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">He answered them, I told you already. You did not listen. Why do you want me to tell you again? Do you also want to be his disciples?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">This made them angry. They said, You are his disciple, but we are disciples of Moses.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">We know that God talked to Moses. But this man, we do not know where he comes from.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">The man who had been blind said, This surprises me! He healed me and yet you do not know where he comes from!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">We know that God does not listen to bad people. But God listens to the person who shows him respect and who obeys him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">Before this, no one has ever healed a man who was born blind. Such a thing has not been heard of since the world was made.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">If this man did not come from God, he could not do anything like this.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">They answered, You have been a bad man ever since you were born! Now are you trying to teach us? And with that they put him out of the meeting place.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">Jesus heard that the people had put him out. When he found him, he said, Do you believe in the Son of God?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">He answered, Sir, who is the Son of God? Tell me, so that I may believe in him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">Jesus said, You have already seen him. The person who is talking to you now, he is the Son of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">The man said, Sir, I do believe. He kneeled down in front of Jesus and worshipped him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">Jesus said, I came into the world so that people may be judged. I came so that those who are blind may see. And I came so that those who see may become blind.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">Some of the Pharisees were with Jesus and heard him say this. They asked him, You mean to say that we are blind also?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">Jesus answered them, If you agreed that you were blind, you would not be bad people.  But you say, "We can see." So then you are still bad people.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="10">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Then Jesus went on to say, I tell you the truth. A person must get to the sheep through the door. Anyone who climbs over the wall to get in is a bad man and steals things. He has come to steal the sheep.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">But the man who comes in through the door, he is the one who takes care of the sheep.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">The guard will open the door for him. The sheep will listen to him. He calls his own sheep by their names and leads them out.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">When all his own sheep are out of the house, he goes ahead of them. The sheep come behind him because they know his voice.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">They will not go after a stranger. They will run away from him because they do not know the voice of strangers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Jesus told this story to the Pharisees, but they did not understand what he was trying to tell them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">So Jesus told them again. He said, I tell you the truth. I am the door of the sheep house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">All those who came before me are bad people and steal things. They came to steal the sheep. But the sheep did not listen to them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">I am the door. Anyone who comes in through me will be saved. He will go in and out as he wants to, and will have food to eat.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">The thief comes only to steal the sheep and to kill them and spoil them. I have come so that people may live and that they may enjoy life to the full.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">I am the good shepherd. I am the one who really cares for the sheep. The good shepherd is willing to die to save his sheep.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Some people work for pay. The one who does that is not the one who really cares. The sheep do not belong to him. When he sees a bad animal coming, he will leave the sheep and run away. He will let the animal take the sheep and make the sheep run away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">He does that because he is only working for pay and does not care what happens to the sheep.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">I am the good shepherd, the one who really cares for the sheep. I know my sheep and my sheep know me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">So my Father knows me and I know him. I am willing to die to save the sheep.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">I have some other sheep which are not with these sheep. I must bring them also. They will listen to my voice. Then all the sheep will be together and there will be one person who cares for all of them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">My Father loves me because I am willing to die. But when I die, I will live again.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">No one kills me. I die only because I choose to die. I have power to die and I have power to live again. This is what my Father has told me to do.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">The Jews did not all say the same thing because of what Jesus said.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Many of them said, A bad spirit is in him. He is crazy. Why do you listen to him?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">But others said, A person who has a bad spirit in him does not say the things this man says. Can a bad spirit make blind people see?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">At that time there was a feast in Jerusalem at the temple. It was the cold time of the year.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Jesus was walking in that part of the temple called Solomons resting place.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">The Jews came around Jesus and said, How long will you keep us wondering about this matter? If you are really the Christ, then tell us plainly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Then Jesus said, I have already told you and you did not believe it. My Father has given me the power to do big works. These works tell you who I am.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And yet you do not believe because you are not my sheep. I told you this before.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">My sheep listen to me. I know them. They come to me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">I give them life that lasts for ever. They will never die. No one will take them out of my hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">My Father gave the sheep to me. He is greater than anyone else. No one is able to take them out of my Fathers hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">My Father and I are one.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Then the leaders of the Jews picked up stones again to kill him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">So Jesus said to them, I have done many good things that come from my Father. For which one of those are you going to kill me?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">Then the Jewish leaders answered him, We do not kill you for doing any good thing. But you do not respect God. You are only a man, and yet you say you are God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Jesus answered them, In your own books it is written that God said, "You are gods."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">, fehlt/missing</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">Nothing can change the words in the holy writings. It is written that God spoke to men and that he called them gods. So he called some men gods. Then why do you say I do not respect God when I say that I am the Son of God? I am the one God chose and sent into the world.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">If I am not doing my Fathers work, then do not believe me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">But if I am doing my Fathers work, believe the work that I do, even though you do not believe me. Then you will know and you will believe that my Father is in me and I am in him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">Because of what he said, they tried to catch Jesus again. But he got away from them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">He went away again to the other side of the Jordan River. He went to the place where John &lt;FI&gt;the Baptizer&lt;Fi&gt; was when he first baptized people. Jesus stayed there for a while.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">Many people came to him there. They said, John himself did not do any big work. But everything that John said about this man is true.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">Many people believed on Jesus there.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="11">
      <VERS vnumber="1">A man named Lazarus was sick. He lived at Bethany, the home of Mary and her sister Martha.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Mary was the same woman that put oil on the Lord and wiped his feet with her hair. It was her brother Lazarus who was sick.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">So the sisters sent someone to tell Jesus. They said, Lord, the one whom you love is sick.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Jesus heard the message. He said, The man is sick, but he will not die from it. But this will show people that God is great, and his Son also.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">When he heard that Lazarus was sick, he stayed where he was for two days more.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">After that, he said to his disciples, Let us go back again to Judea.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">They said, Master, it is not long since the Jews wanted to kill you with stones. Are you going back there again?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Jesus answered them, Are there not twelve hours in the day? If a person walks in the daylight, then he will not fall. He can see by the light that is in the world.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">But if a person walks at night, he will fall because there is no light for him to see.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">After he said this, he said also, Our friend Lazarus is sleeping, but I am going to wake him up.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">His disciples said, Lord, if he is sleeping then he will get well again.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">But Jesus meant that Lazarus had died. The disciples thought that Lazarus was sleeping to have a rest.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Then Jesus told them plainly. He said, Lazarus is dead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">For your sake I am glad that I was not there. You will really believe in me. But come, let us go to him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Then Thomas, who was called the Twin, said to the other disciples, Let us all go and die with Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">When Jesus came, he found that Lazarus had been buried four days.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Bethany was only about two miles from Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Many Jews had come out to see Martha and Mary. They came to comfort them because their brother had died.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">As soon as Martha heard that Jesus was coming, she went to meet him. But Mary just stayed in the house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Martha said to Jesus, Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">But even yet, I know that God will give you anything that you ask for.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Jesus said, Your brother will rise again.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Martha said, I know that he will rise when the dead people are raised up on the last day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Jesus said, I am the one who will raise people up and give them life. The person who believes in me will live, even though he has died.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Anyone who is living and who believes in me will never die. Do you believe this?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">She said, Yes, Lord, I believe that you are the Christ. I believe that you are the Son of God who was to come into the world.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">When she had said this, she went back to call her sister. She said quietly, Mary, the Master has come. He is calling you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">When Mary heard that, she got up quickly and came to him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Jesus was not in the town yet. He was at the same place where Martha had met him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">The Jews who were in the house to comfort Mary saw her get up quickly and go out.  They went after her. They said, She is going to the grave to cry.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">Mary reached the place where Jesus was. When she saw him, she kneeled down before him and said, Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">Jesus saw her crying. He saw the Jews who came with her crying also. Then his heart was troubled very much.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Where have you buried him? he said. Come, Lord, and see, they said.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">Then Jesus cried.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">Look, the Jews said. He truly loved him very much!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">Then some of them said, This man made the blind see. Could he not have saved Lazarus from dying?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">Jesus heart was troubled very much again. Then he came to the grave. It was a hole in the side of a large rock. A stone covered the hole.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">Jesus said, Take the stone away. Martha, the sister of the dead man, said, Lord, he will smell bad by this time. He has been dead four days already.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">Jesus said to her, Did I not tell you that if you believed God you would see that he is great?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">So they pushed the stone away from the grave. Jesus looked up and said, Father, I thank you because you have heard me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">I know that you always hear me. But I have said this so that the people who are standing here might believe that you have sent me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">When he had said this, he shouted, Lazarus, come out!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">Out came the dead man! The cloth that they had buried him in was tied around his hands and feet. Another small cloth was tied around his face. Jesus said to the people, Take off the cloths and free him!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">When they saw the things Jesus did, many of the Jews who had come with Mary believed on Him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">But some of them went to the Pharisees and told them what Jesus had done.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">So the chief priests and the Pharisees met together. They said, What are we going to do?  This man is doing many big works.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">If we do not stop him, everybody will believe on him. Then the Roman rulers will come and break down our holy town and our nation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">One of them, Caiaphas, was high priest that year. He said to them, You know nothing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">You do not understand. It is better for us if one person dies for the people. Then the whole nation will not be broken down.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="51">He himself did not understand what he was saying. But he was the high priest that year.  God spoke through him to say that Jesus should die for those people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="52">Jesus would die, not only for those people, but he would gather together all of Gods people who are out in different places.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="53">So from that day on they planned to kill Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="54">That is why Jesus did not go among the Jews in the open. But he went to another part of the country, to a town called Ephraim. He stayed there with his disciples.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="55">The time for the Passover Feast of the Jews was near. Many people from all around the country went to Jerusalem. They had to make themselves clean according to the law before the Passover Feast.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="56">They were looking around for Jesus. As they were standing in the temple they talked to one another. They said, What do you think? Do you think that he will come to the feast?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="57">Both the chief priest and the Pharisees had told the people, If any man knows where he is, tell us. We want to catch him.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="12">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Six days before the Passover Feast Jesus came to Bethany where Lazarus lived. This was the Lazarus that Jesus had raised from death.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">The people made supper for Jesus. Martha helped give food for the people, and Lazarus was one of those who sat at the table with Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Mary had a jar of oil. It smelled very nice and cost much money. She put some of it on Jesus feet. Then she wiped his feet with her hair. The smell of oil went all through the house.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Before the Passover Feast had started, Jesus saw that the time had come for him to leave this world. The time had come for him to go back to his Father. He loved his own people who were in the world. And he loved them the same way right to the end.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">He and his disciples were eating together. The devil had already put it into Judas heart to give Jesus over to people who hated him. (Judas was the son of Simon Iscariot.)</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">You are the only true God. If they know you, and Jesus Christ whom you sent, they will live for ever.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">I made your name great on earth. I have done the work you gave me to do.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">So now, Father, let my name be great with you. Make my name as great as it was when I was with you before the world was made.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">I have shown these men who you really are. They are men whom you gave me from the world. They belonged to you and you gave them to me. They have obeyed you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Now they really know that everything you gave me comes from you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">I have told them the things that you told me to tell them. And they have believed my words. They know it is true that I was with you before I came. They have believed that you sent me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">It is these men I am asking you for. I am not asking you for the people of the world. But I am asking for those you gave me, because they belong to you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">All those I have are yours. And all you have are mine. And they make my name great.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">I am not in the world any longer. But they are in the world. And I am coming to you.  Holy Father, keep them in your name, which you have given me. Then they will be one,  just as you and I are one.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">While I was with them, I took care of them in your name, which you gave me. I have taken care of them. Only one of them is lost. That is the one who was born to be lost.  What your book says came true.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Now I am coming to you. I say these things while I am in the world so that they may be very glad, as I am.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">I have told them what you said. The world has hated them because they do not belong to the world. So also, I do not belong to the world.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">I do not ask you to take them out of the world. But I ask you to take care of them, so that the evil one of this world will not harm them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">They do not belong to the world, even as I do not belong to the world.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Make them clean by the true word and keep them for yourself. Your word is true.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">I have sent them into the world as you sent me into the world.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">I have made myself clean and kept myself for them, so that they may be clean and be kept for you also by the truth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">I do not ask this for these people only; I ask it also for the people who will believe in me when they hear what these people say.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">I do this so that the people will all be one. That is the same way with us. You, my Father,  belong to me and I belong to you. I ask that they also may be joined to us. Then the world will believe that you have sent me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">I have made them great the way you have made me great. That makes us one, as we are one.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">I belong to them and you belong to me, so that they all may be really one together. Then the world will know that you have sent me and that you have loved them just as you have loved me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Father, I want the people that you have given me to be with me. Then they will see that you made me great, because you loved me before you made the world.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Father, you are the one who is right. The world has not known you. But I have known you. These people know that you have sent me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">I have told them who you are. I will tell them again and again. Then they will love each other as much as you have loved me. And I will live in them.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="18">
      <VERS vnumber="1">When Jesus had finished saying this, he and his disciples went through the valley called Kidron. There was a garden with trees. He and his disciples went into the garden.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Jesus had gone to this place often with his disciples, so Judas knew where the place was.  He was the one who gave Jesus over to the people who hated him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">The chief priests and the Pharisees sent soldiers and guards with Judas. They had lamps,  and torches, and things to fight with.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Jesus knew everything that was going to happen to him. So he went out and said to them,  Who are you looking for?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">They answered, Jesus from Nazareth. Jesus said to them, I am he. Judas, who had given Jesus over to them, was standing with them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">When Jesus said to them, I am he, they all drew back suddenly and fell down.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">So Jesus asked them again, Who are you looking for? And they said, Jesus from Nazareth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Then Jesus answered, I have already told you that I am he. If you are looking for me, let these men go.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">So his words came true. He had said, I did not lose one of those you gave me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Simon Peter had a long knife or sword. He took it out and hit the servant of the high priest and cut off his right ear. The servants name was Malchus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Jesus said to Peter, Put your sword back in its place. Must I not drink the cup that my Father has given me?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Then the soldiers, and the captain, and the guards caught Jesus and tied him up.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">First they took him to Annas. He was the father of Caiaphas wife. Caiaphas was the high priest that year.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">This was the same Caiaphas that had talked to the leaders of the Jews. He had said, It is better for one man to die for the people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Simon Peter and one other disciple went after Jesus. The other disciple knew the high priest, so he went right in with Jesus through the gate of the high priests large house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">But Peter stood by the gate outside. The other disciple who knew the high priest talked to the servant at the door and brought in Peter.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">The servant at the door said to Peter, Are you one of this mans disciples too? Peter said,  No, I am not!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">It was cold there. The servants and the officers had made a small fire. They stood by it and warmed themselves. Peter stood by the fire also and warmed himself.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">The high priest then asked Jesus about his disciples, and about his teaching.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Jesus answered him, I have talked so that anyone who wanted to could hear me. I have always taught in the meeting houses and in the temple. That is where the Jews always go.  I have not said anything in a secret way.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Why do you ask me? The people heard me talk. Ask them what I told them. They know what I said.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">When he had said this, one of the officers who stood there hit Jesus. He said, Is that the way you answer the high priest?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Jesus answered him, If I have said anything bad, tell me plainly what wrong thing I have said. If I have told the truth, why do you hit me?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Jesus was still tied up. Annas sent him over to Caiaphas the high priest.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Simon Peter stayed by the fire and stood warming himself. So the people said to him,  Are you not one of his disciples also? He said, No, I am not!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">A servant was there. He was of the same family as the one whose ear Peter had cut off.  He said, Did I not see you in the garden with him?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Again Peter said, No! And just then a cock called out.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Then the Jewish leaders took Jesus from Caiaphas to the court house. It was early in the day. They themselves did not go into the court house. They did not want to become unclean. They wanted to eat the Passover Feast.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Pilate went out to the Jewish leaders and said, What complaint do you bring against this man?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">They said to him, If he were not a very bad man, then we would not have brought him to you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Pilate said, Take him and judge him by your own law. The leaders of the Jews said,  But we are not allowed to kill anyone.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">So this is the way the words of Jesus came true. He had said how he was going to die.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">Then Pilate went back into the court house again. He called for Jesus and asked him,  Are you the King of the Jews?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Jesus answered, Do you ask me because you yourself think I am, or do you ask me because others said I am?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">Pilate answered, Am I a Jew? Your own people and the chief priests have brought you here to me. Tell me, what have you done?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">Jesus answered him, I am not a king in this world. If I were, my people would fight so that I would not be given to the Jews. But I am not a king in this world.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">So Pilate said, So you really are a king then? Jesus answered, You say that I am a king. The reason that I was born was that I should tell what is true. That is why I came into the world. Everyone who likes what is true listens to what I say.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">Pilate said, What is truth? When he had said this, he went out to the Jews again. He told them, I find nothing wrong in this man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">But at the Passover Feast you always want me to let one prisoner go free for you. Do you want me to let the King of the Jews go free?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">Then they all shouted again, Not this man, but Barabbas! Barabbas was a man who had stolen things.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="19">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Pilate took Jesus and had him beaten.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">The soldiers made a big ring of thorns like a crown and put it on Jesus head. They put a red gown on him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">They said, Greetings, King of the Jews! They beat him with their hands.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Then Pilate went out to the people again and said to them, See, I bring the man before you. This is to show you that I find nothing wrong in him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Then Jesus came out. He had the crown of thorns on his head and had the red gown on him. Pilate said, Here is the man!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">When the chief priests and the officers saw Jesus, they shouted, Nail him to a cross! Nail him to a cross! Pilate said to them, You take him and nail him to a cross. I find nothing wrong in him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">The leaders of the Jews answered him, We have a law. That law says he should die,  because he calls himself the Son of God. When Pilate heard what they said, he was very much afraid.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">He went into the court house again and said to Jesus, Where do you come from? But Jesus did not answer him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Then Pilate said, Do you not answer me? Do you not know that I have power to nail you to a cross, or to let you go free?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Jesus said, You would have no power over me if God did not give you power. So then,  the man who gave me up to you has done something worse than you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">After that Pilate tried to let Jesus go free. But the Jews shouted, If you let this man free,  you are not Caesars friend! Anyone who makes himself a king is fighting against Caesar!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">When Pilate heard this, he brought Jesus out. Then Pilate sat on the bench where the judge sits. The place was called the Street of Stone. The Jews called it Gabbatha.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">It was about the middle of the day before the Passover Feast. Pilate said to the Jews,  See, here is your King!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">But they shouted, Take him away! Take him away! Nail him to a cross! Pilate said to them, Shall I nail your King to a cross? The chief priests answered, Caesar is the only king we have.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Then Pilate gave them Jesus to be nailed to a cross.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">They took Jesus and led him away. Jesus went out carrying his own cross. They went to a place which the Jews called Golgotha. That means the place of the skull bone.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">There they nailed Jesus to the cross. Two other people were also nailed to crosses. One was put on each side of Jesus. Jesus was put in the centre.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Pilate wrote a sign and put it on the cross. He wrote, Jesus from Nazareth, the King of the Jews.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Many of the Jews read this sign. The place where Jesus was nailed to a cross was near the city. The sign was written in the Jewish, Greek, and Latin languages.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Then the chief priests among the Jews said to Pilate, Do not write, "The King of the Jews," but write, "This man said he is King of the Jews."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Pilate answered, What I have written I have written!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">When the soldiers had nailed Jesus to the cross, they took his clothes. They divided them into four parts and gave each soldier one part. Then they took his coat. It was not sewn together but the cloth was all made in one piece from the top to the bottom.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">So the soldiers said to one another, We will not tear this. But let us gamble for it. What the holy writings say came true. They say, They divided my clothes among them. They gambled for my coat. That is what the soldiers did.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Near the cross of Jesus stood his mother, his mothers sister, Mary the wife of Cleophas,  and Mary Magdalene.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Jesus saw his mother and the disciple whom he loved standing near. He said to his mother, Woman, see your son!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And he said to the disciple, See your mother! From that time on, that disciple took her to live in his own home.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Jesus now knew that everything had happened that the holy writings said. He said, I am thirsty.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">A bowl of bad wine was there. They took something called a sponge and made it wet with the wine. Then they put it on a stick and put it to Jesus mouth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Jesus took the wine. Then he said, It is finished. And he bowed his head and died.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">It was the day before the Sabbath day. The Jewish leaders did not want the bodies to stay on the cross on the Sabbath day because it was a big day. So they begged Pilate to break the legs of those who had been nailed to crosses. Then they could be taken away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">The soldiers came and broke the legs of the one nailed to the cross on one side of Jesus.  Then they broke the legs of the one on the other side of him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">When they came to Jesus, they saw that he was dead already. So they did not break his legs.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">One of the soldiers stuck a spear into the side of Jesus body. Right away, blood and water came out.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">The man who saw it told what he saw, so that you may believe. What he said is true and he knows that it is true.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">What the holy writings say came true. They say, Not one of his bones shall be broken.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">They also say, They shall look at the one into whom they stuck the spear.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">A man named Joseph, from the town of Arimathea, was a disciple of Jesus. But he did not say so because he was afraid of the leaders of the Jews. After all this had happened,  he went to Pilate. He asked him to let him take Jesus body away. Pilate let him. So he came and took his body.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">Nicodemus also came. He was the one who had come to Jesus at night. He brought with him a heavy bag of sweet-smelling spices called myrrh and aloes. It was mixed together.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">They wrapped linen cloth around the body of Jesus and put the myrrh and aloes in with the cloth. That is how Jews bury a person.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">There was a garden at the place where Jesus was nailed to the cross. In the garden was a new grave cut in the rock. No one had ever been laid in it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">They laid Jesus body there because it was the day before the Sabbath day, and the grave was near.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="20">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Mary Magdalene came to the grave on the first day of the week. It was early in the morning and not very light. She saw that the stone had been taken away from the grave.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">So she ran and met Simon Peter and the other disciple, whom Jesus loved. She said to them, They have taken the Lord out of the grave! We do not know where they have laid him!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Then Peter and that other disciple also went to the grave.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Both of them ran. The other disciple ran faster than Peter and got to the grave first.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">He bent down and looked in. He saw the linen cloths lying there, but he did not go inside.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Then Simon Peter came up behind him. He went into the grave and saw the linen cloths lying there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">He also saw the small cloth that had been wrapped around Jesus head. It was not with the other cloths, but it was folded together by itself in another place.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Then the other disciple, who got there first, also went in. He saw and believed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Until this time they did not understand the holy writings where it says, He must rise from death.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Then the disciples went away again to their own homes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">But Mary stood outside the grave crying. As she cried, she bent down and looked into the grave.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">She saw two angels with white clothes on. They were sitting where Jesus body had been.  One sat at the head and one at the foot.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">They said to her, Woman, why are you crying? She said to them, They have taken away my Lord and I do not know where they have laid him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">When she had said this, she turned around. She saw Jesus standing there, but she did not know that it was Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Jesus said to her, Woman, why are you crying? Who are you looking for? She thought he was the man who took care of the garden. So she said to him, Sir, if you have carried him away, tell me where you have laid him. I will take him away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Jesus said to her, Mary. She turned around again and said, Master!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Jesus said to her, Do not hold me, because I have not yet gone up to my Father. But go to my brothers and tell them that I am going up to my Father. He is your Father also. I am going up to my God. He is your God also.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Mary Magdalene went to the disciples. She said, I have seen the Lord! And she told them what he had said to her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">It was the first day of the week. In the evening the disciples were in a house together.  The doors were shut because they were afraid of the Jewish leaders. Jesus came and stood there with them. He said to them, Peace to you!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">When he had said this, he showed them his hands and his side. The disciples were glad when they saw the Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Jesus said to them again, Peace to you! My Father sent me: now I am sending you in the same way.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">When he had said this, he breathed on them and said, Receive the Holy Spirit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Whoever you make free from the wrong things they have done will be free. Whoever you do not make free from the wrong things they have done will not be free.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Thomas, one of the twelve disciples, was called the Twin. He was not with them when Jesus came.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">The other disciples told him about it. They said, We have seen the Lord! Thomas said, I will not believe unless I see the mark of the nails in his hands. I will not believe unless I put my finger on the mark and feel his side with my hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Then eight days later his disciples were in the house again. This time Thomas was with them. The doors were shut. Then Jesus came and stood there with them. He said to them, Peace to you!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Then he said to Thomas, Put your finger here. Look at my hands. Feel my side with your hand. Do not doubt anymore, but believe.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Thomas said to him, My Lord and my God!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Jesus said to him, You yourself have seen me. Is that why you now believe? God will bless people who believe though they have not seen me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Jesus did many other big works when he was with the disciples. They are not written in this book.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">But these things are written so that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God. And when you believe in his name, then he will give you power to live.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="21">
      <VERS vnumber="1">The next time the disciples saw Jesus was at the Sea of Tiberias &lt;FI&gt;Galilee&lt;Fi&gt; . This is how Jesus showed himself to them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Some of the disciples were in one place. They were Simon Peter, Thomas called the Twin, Nathanael of Cana in Galilee, the sons of Zebedee, and two other disciples of Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Simon Peter said to the others, I am going fishing. The others said, We are going with you also. They went out in a boat right away. That night they caught nothing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Early in the morning, Jesus was standing there by the sea. The disciples did not know it was Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">He said to them, My children, did you catch any fish? They answered, No.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">He said to them, Throw out your net on the right side of the boat, then you will catch some. They threw out their net and caught many fish, so that they were not able to bring in the net.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">That disciple whom Jesus loved said to Peter, It is the Lord! As soon as Simon Peter heard it was the Lord, he put on his coat and his belt. He had taken off some clothes to work. Then he jumped into the water.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">The other disciples came in a small boat. They were pulling the net. It was full of fish.  They were not far from the land, only about a hundred yards.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">When they came to the land, they saw a small fire. Fish and some bread lay on the fire.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Jesus said to them, Bring some of the fish which you have just caught.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Simon Peter went to the boat. He pulled the net to land. It was full of big fish. There were a hundred and fifty three fish. But even with so many fish the net did not break.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Jesus said to them, Come and eat. The disciples were all afraid to ask him, Who are you? They knew it was the Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Jesus came. He took bread and gave it to them. Then he took fish and gave it to them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">This was the third time that Jesus showed himself to the disciples after he had risen from death.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">After they had eaten, Jesus said to Simon Peter, Simon, son of John, do you love me more than these? He said, Yes, Lord. You know that I like you. I am your friend. Jesus said to him, Feed my lambs.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">He asked him the second time, Simon, son of John, do you love me? Peter said, Yes,  Lord. You know that I like you. I am your friend. Jesus said to him, Take care of my sheep.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Then he asked Peter the third time, Simon son of John, do you like me? Peter was sad because of the way Jesus asked him the third time. So he answered him, Lord, you know everything. You know that I love you as a close friend Jesus said to him, Feed my sheep.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">I tell you the truth. When you were young, you put on your own belt. You went where you wanted to go. But when you are old, you will put out your hands. Others will put your belt on for you. They will take you where you do not want to go.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Jesus said this to show how Peter would die and make Gods name great. When he had finished saying this, he said to him, Come and follow me!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Peter turned around. The disciple whom Jesus loved was coming with Jesus also. He was the one who was at Jesus right side at the supper table. He had said to Jesus, Lord, who will give you over to people who hate you?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">When Peter saw him, he said to Jesus, Lord, what about this man?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Jesus said to him, If I want him to wait till I come, what is that to you? I want you to come and follow me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">So the report went around among the brothers that that disciple would not die. Jesus had not said to him, You will not die. But he had said, If I want him to wait till I come, what is that to you?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">The same disciple said these things and wrote them. We know what he said is true.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Jesus did many other things also. If every one were written down, I think that the world would be too small to hold all the books that would need to be written. Yes, it is so!</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="4">One day when he was eating with them, he told them not to leave Jerusalem. He said,  Wait here for what the Father promised you. I have told you about that promise already.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">John baptised with water. But you will be baptised with the Holy Spirit when a few days have passed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">When they had come together, the apostles asked Jesus, Lord, are you now going to set up the kingdom of Israel?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">He answered them, You will not know the days or the months which the Father has chosen.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">But when the Holy Spirit comes upon you, you will receive power. You will speak of me in Jerusalem and all around in Judea and Samaria and everywhere in the world.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">When Jesus had said this, he went up. They watched him going. Then a cloud hid him,  and they did not see him any more.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">While they were looking at the sky as he went up, two men stood by them in white clothes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">They said, You men from Galilee, why do you stand there looking at the sky? Jesus has gone up into heaven. In the same way that you saw him go up, he will come again.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Then they left the hill called the Mount of Olives. They went back to Jerusalem which was not far away. (It was how far the law said people may walk on the Sabbath day.)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">When they reached Jerusalem, they went to a room up in a house. Here lived Peter and John, James and Andrew, Philip and Thomas, Bartholomew and Matthew, James the son of Alpheus, and Simon the freedom fighter, and Judas the son of James.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">All of these people were talking to God. The women, Jesus mother Mary, and Jesus  brothers were there talking to God also.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">About one hundred and twenty people were gathered together. Peter stood up among them to speak to them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">He said, My friends and brothers, Judas showed the people where Jesus was so they could take him. The Holy Spirit spoke through king David long ago about Judas before he did it. What was written about him has now happened.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Judas was one of us. He had his part of the work to do. (</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Judas received money for the wrong thing he did. He bought a field with the money and fell on his face. His belly burst open and all his insides came out.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">All the people who live in Jerusalem know about this. In their language they named the field Akeldama, which means The Field of Blood.)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">The book of Psalms says, "His house must be empty. No one may live in it." And it also says, "Someone else must do his work."</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="22">They were with us from the time John baptised people until the day Jesus was taken up from us. One of these men must help us tell people that Jesus was raised from death.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">They took two men. One was Joseph, named Barsabbas, who had another name Justus.  The other man was Matthias.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Then the people talked to God. They said, Lord, you know what is in everybodys heart.  Show us which of these two men you have chosen to have a part in this work and to be an apostle. For Judas left this work and went to the place where he belonged.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Then they picked out the name of Matthias. He was chosen to be with the eleven apostles.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="4">All of them were filled with the Holy Spirit. They began to speak the words of God in other languages as the Spirit spoke through them.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="9">We people from the countries of Parthia and Media and Elam all hear the wonderful things God has done.

These men from Galilee are speaking in our own languages.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="22">You men of Israel, listen to this. God showed you that he was pleased with this man,  Jesus of Nazareth. He proved it by the big works and the wonderful signs which he did by Jesus right here among you people. And you yourselves know it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">This same Jesus was given up. You let bad men take him. You let them nail him to a cross and kill him. This is just the way God had planned it. He knew how it would happen.

      <VERS vnumber="31">David knew what would happen. So he said that Christ would be raised from death.  Christ was not left in the grave. His body was not spoiled. David said all this before it ever happened.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">And now we all saw it. We are telling people that God raised this Jesus back to life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">God made him great by making him sit at his right side. God gave him the Holy Spirit as he had promised. So he sent this which you now see and hear.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">One day at three oclock, Peter and John went to the temple to talk with God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">There was a man who had been born lame. He was carried and was laid at the gate of the temple every day. The gate was called Beautiful. He was brought there to beg. He asked for money from the people who went into the temple.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">This man saw Peter and John ready to go into the temple. He begged them to give him something.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Peter and John looked at him. Peter said, Look at us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">The man looked at them. He thought they would give him something.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Then Peter said, I have no money. But I will give you what I have. In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, get up and walk!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">He took the mans right hand and raised him up. Right away his feet and ankles became strong.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">He jumped to his feet and walked into the temple with them. He was so happy he jumped around and praised God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">All the people saw him walking and praising God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And they knew that this was the man who sat begging at the temple gate which was called Beautiful. They were very much surprised at what had happened to him. They could hardly believe it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">While the man still held on to Peter and John, all the people came running to them. It was in the part of the temple which is called Solomons porch. They were still very excited.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">When Peter saw this, he talked to the people. He said, Men of Israel, why are you so surprised at this? Do you think that we have power or are good enough to make this man walk? Why do you look at us that way?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">The God of Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and of our fathers, has made his Son Jesus great.  You gave him up to Pilate. You did not want to believe who he was. You did not want him back when Pilate agreed to let him go free.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="16">This man whom you see and know, believed in the name of Jesus Christ. This mans faith in that name has healed him. Yes, believing in Jesus Christ has made him well here in front of you all.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="18">But in this way God did what he had told us would happen. Through all the prophets he had told us that Christ would suffer.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Peter and John were talking to the people. The priests, and the captain of the temple, and the Sadducees came to them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">They were angry at Peter and John because they taught the people. They were angry because they told them that Jesus was brought back from death.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">They caught them and put them in prison until the next day, because it was already evening.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">But many of the people who heard them speak the word of God, believed what they said.  The number of men who believed was about five thousand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">The next day their rulers, leaders, and scribes met in Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Annas the high priest, Caiaphas, John, Alexander, and all of the high priests family were there also.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Peter and John were brought before them. They asked the apostles, By what power or in what name have you done this?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Then Peter, filled with the Holy Spirit, said to them, Rulers of the people and leaders of Israel, have you brought us to court today because of the good thing that was done to the lame man? Do you want to find out how he was healed?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Well, let it be known by all the people of Israel. This man standing before you is healed by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth. He has done this. You nailed him to a cross, but God raised him from death.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Jesus Christ is the stone which you, the builders, would not use. But he is now the chief corner stone.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">No one else can save us. Of all the people in the world, God chose him to save us. It is by him we must be saved.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">They saw that Peter and John were not afraid to speak out. They knew that they were like any other men. They did not have much training. So the people were very much surprised. They knew that Peter and John had been with Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">They saw the man who had been healed standing beside them. So they could say nothing against them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">They told Peter and John to leave the court. Then they talked the matter over among themselves.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">They said, What shall we do to these men? All the people who live in Jerusalem know about this big work they have done. And we cannot say they did not do it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">But we do not want any more people to hear about it. So let us say to these men, "Take care! Never speak to anyone in this name again."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">They called them in and said, Never speak or teach in this name again.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">But Peter and John answered them, How does God look at it? Is it right for us to obey you or to obey him? You judge that for yourselves.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">As for us, we must tell the things we have seen and heard.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">So the high priest and those with him told them again. Then they let them go. They could not punish them because of the people. They all praised God for what had been done.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">The man who had been healed was more than forty years old.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">When they were free, Peter and John went back to their own friends. They told them all that the chief priests and leaders had said to them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">When they heard it, they talked to God together. They said, Lord, you are God. You made the sky, and the earth, the sea, and all that is in them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Our father David was your servant. Through him you said by the Holy Spirit, "Why are the people who are not Jews so angry? And why do the people plan things for nothing?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">The kings of the earth joined their forces. And the rulers met together against the Lord and his Christ."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">It is true that Herod and Pontius Pilate met together with Jews and those who were not Jews here in this city. They met to make secret plans against your holy Son Jesus, whom you made Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">But they only did what you had already planned should be done.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Lord, hear their words. Listen to the wrong things they say against us. We are your servants. Help us to speak your word without fear. And heal the sick by your own power.  Let signs and wonderful things be done in the name of your holy Son Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">When they had talked to God, the room they were in shook. They were all filled with the Holy Spirit. And they spoke the word of God without fear.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">All the believers were one in heart and mind. Not one of them said, This is mine. But everything they had was for the use of all.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">With much power the apostles told how the Lord Jesus was raised from death. And God blessed them all very much.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">None of them was in need of anything. Those who owned fields and houses sold them.  They brought the money to the apostles. Then the apostles gave each one what he needed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">There was a man named Joseph, a Levite. He was born in the country of Cyprus. The apostles called him Barnabas. That means "one who helps."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">He had a field and sold it. He brought the money to the apostles and gave it to them.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="5">
      <VERS vnumber="1">A man named Ananias and his wife, Sapphira, sold a field. He brought some of the money to the apostles. But he kept the rest of it. His wife knew what he had done.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Peter said, Ananias, why has Satan filled your heart? Why do you lie to the Holy Spirit?  You have kept some of the money which you got for the field.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">As long as you had the field, it belonged to you. When you had the money, you could do what you wanted to do with it. Why then did you plan to do a thing like this? You have not lied to men, but to God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">As Ananias heard Peters words, he fell down and died. All who heard these things were very much afraid.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">The young men came and wrapped him up. They carried him out and buried him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">About three hours later, his wife came in. She did not know what had happened.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Peter asked her, Tell me, did you sell the field for so much money? and she answered,  Yes, that is how much it was.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Then Peter said to her, Why did you two agree together to test the Spirit of the Lord?  Listen, I hear the footsteps of the men who buried your husband. They are at the door.  They will carry you out too.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And she fell down at Peters feet and died. The young men came in and saw that she was dead. They carried her out and buried her beside her husband.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Then all the church people, and all the people who heard about this were very much afraid.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">The apostles did many signs and wonderful things for the people who met together in the place called Solomons porch.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Other people feared to join them, but they spoke well of them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Many more men and women believed and came to the Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">They brought sick people out into the streets and laid them on beds and mats. They hoped that at least Peters shadow would touch them as he passed by.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Many people also came from the cities around Jerusalem. They brought others who were sick and those who were controlled by bad spirits. Every one of them was healed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Some Sadducees were with the high priest. They all became very jealous.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">They caught the apostles and put them in prison.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">But that night the angel of the Lord opened the prison doors and brought them out.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Go, said the angel. Stand in the temple and tell the people all about this new life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">When the apostles heard that, they went into the temple early in the morning and taught the people there. The high priest and his men came. They called a meeting of the court and all the leaders of the Jews. Then they sent men to the prison to bring the apostles out.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">When the men came to the prison, they did not find the apostles there. Then they went back and told the high priest and those with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">They said, The prison was locked very well. And the police were guarding the doors.  But when we opened the doors, no one was inside.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">When the high priest, the captain of the temple, and the chief priests heard this, they did not know what to think. We wonder what will come from all this, they thought.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Just then someone came and told them, The men you put in prison are standing in the temple teaching the people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Then the captain went with the men and brought the apostles quietly. They did not bring them by force because they were afraid the people would kill them with stones.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">So they brought them in and put them before the court. The high priest asked them, Did we not tell you that you must never teach again in this name? But here you are, teaching people all over Jerusalem in this name. You are trying to put on us the blame for this mans death.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Then Peter and the other apostles answered them, We must obey God rather than men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">The God of our fathers raised up Jesus, the one you killed by hanging on a dead tree.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">God has made him great at his right side. He has made him leader and Saviour. He has done this so that the people of Israel may stop doing wrong things and be forgiven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">We know these things are true. So does the Holy Spirit whom God has given to those who obey him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">When the judges heard this, they were very, very angry and wanted to kill them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Then a lawyer named Gamaliel stood up in the court. He was a Pharisee and all the people respected him. He asked that the apostles be taken out for a while.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">Then he said, Men of Israel, you had better take care what you plan to do to these men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">Before this time, there was a man named Theudas. He tried to make people believe that he was a great man. He had about four hundred followers. He was killed, and all of his followers were scattered, and the whole thing ended.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">Then after that, at tax time, another man named Judas from Galilee made trouble. Many people followed him. He also was killed and all of his followers were scattered. 38,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">So now, I say, do nothing to these men. Leave them alone. If this is the teaching or work of men, it will come to an end. But if it is of God, you cannot stop these men. You might even be fighting against God!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">They agreed to do what he said. They called in the apostles and had them beaten. They told them not to speak in the name of Jesus. Then they let them go.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">The apostles left the court. They were very glad to think that God let them be punished for the name of Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">Every day, in the temple and in homes, they kept on teaching and talking about Jesus Christ.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="6">
      <VERS vnumber="1">At that time more and more people joined the disciples. Then there was trouble about a certain matter. The Jews who spoke the Greek language complained against the other Jews. They said that each day when the food was being divided, their women whose husbands were dead did not get their part.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Then the twelve apostles called all of the disciples together. They said, It is not right for us to stop preaching Gods word to divide the food.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">So then, brothers, you choose seven men who you know are good men. Choose men who are full of the Holy Spirit and are wise. We will give them the work to divide the food.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">But we ourselves will keep on talking with God and telling his word.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">This pleased all the people. The men they chose were Stephen, a man who believed God and was full of the Holy Spirit, Philip, Prochorus, Nicanor, Timon, Parmenas, and Nicolaus from Antioch who had joined the Jews.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">These men were brought before the apostles. When the apostles had talked with God,  they put their hands on their heads &lt;FI&gt;to bless them&lt;Fi&gt; .</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">The word of God spread further and further, and many people in Jerusalem believed.  Many of the priests also believed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Stephen received much blessing and power from God. He did many wonderful things and signs among the people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">But some of the Jews argued with Stephen, and said he was wrong. (They belonged to the meeting place of the Free Men. They were Jews who came from Cyrene, Alexandria,  Cilicia and Asia Minor.) They did not agree with Stephen.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">But they could not say anything against his wise words and the Spirit by whom he spoke.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">So they paid some people to say, We have heard him say wrong things about Moses and God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">They talked to the people, the leaders, and the scribes, and made them angry. They went quickly and caught Stephen and took him into the court.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">They brought in the men who told lies about him. They said, This man is always saying wrong things about this holy place and the laws.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">We have heard him say that this Jesus of Nazareth will break down this place and that he will change the law which Moses gave us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Then all the judges who sat in the court looked at him and they saw that his face was like the face of an angel.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="7">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Then the high priest asked, Is this true?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Stephen replied, Men, brothers and fathers, listen to me. When our father Abraham was in the country of Mesopotamia, before he lived in the country of Haran, the God who is great and wonderful came to him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">God said, "Leave your country and your family and come to the country that I will show you."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Then Abraham came out of the country of the Chaldeans and lived for a while in the country of Haran. After his father died, God led him from there to this country where you are living now.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">But God did not give any of the land to Abraham, not even a small part. But he promised that the land would belong to him. After him it would belong to his children, even though he did not have a child then.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">This is what God told Abraham. He told him that his children would travel and live in another land. They would be slaves to the people there. They would have a hard time for four hundred years.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And God said, "I will judge the people who make them slaves. After that, they will come out of that land and serve me here."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">God made the agreement of circumcision with Abraham. Abraham had a son Isaac. He made the mark of circumcision on the childs body and circumcised him on the eighth day. Isaac had a son Jacob, and Jacob had twelve sons who were our fathers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Because they were jealous, they sold Joseph to be a slave in the country of Egypt. But God was with Joseph.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">He took him out of all his troubles. He blessed him and made him wise in the eyes of Pharaoh, the king of Egypt. Pharaoh made him president in Egypt and a ruler over all the people of his house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">For a long, long time there was no rain in Egypt and Canaan. And so there was very little food. This caused much trouble. Our fathers had nothing to eat.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Then Jacob heard that there was food in Egypt. He sent his sons on their first trip to buy some. They were our fathers of long ago.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">The second time they went, Joseph told his brothers who he was. And Pharaoh found out who Josephs family was.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Then Joseph sent for Jacob his father and all the family to come. There were seventy-five people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">So Jacob went to Egypt. There he and our fathers died.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">They were taken back to the place called Shechem and buried. Abraham had bought a grave from the family of Hamor in Shechem. He had paid money for it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Then it was almost time for God to do what he had promised to Abraham. The family of Jacob had become very large in Egypt.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Then a new king who did not know Joseph ruled over Egypt.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">This king was not kind to our fathers but he gave them a hard time. They had to put their babies outside to die.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Moses was born during that time. He was a very fine baby. For three months he was raised in his own fathers home.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">When he was put outside to die, Pharaohs daughter took him. She raised him as her own son.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Moses was taught all the things the Egyptians knew. He knew how to talk and could do great things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">When he was forty years old he decided to visit his own family, the people of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">There he saw one of them being hurt by an Egyptian. So he helped him. He fought for him and knocked down the Egyptian.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">He thought his people would know that God wanted him to make them free. But they did not understand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">The next day he saw two of his own people fighting and he wanted to make peace. "You are brothers," he said. "Why are you fighting?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">But the one who was fighting his neighbour pushed Moses away. He said, "Who made you our ruler and our judge?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Do you want to kill me as you did the Egyptian yesterday?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">When Moses heard these words, he left Egypt at once. He lived as a stranger in the country of Midian. While he was there, two sons were born to him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">When forty years had passed, he was in the wilderness near the hill called Sinai. There he saw fire in a small tree. An angel of the Lord was in the fire.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Moses looked at it. He was very much surprised. He came closer to look at it better.  Then he heard the Lord speak to him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">The Lord said, "I am the God of your fathers. I am the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob." Moses began to shake. He was afraid to look.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">Then the Lord said, "Take off your shoes. You are standing on holy ground.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">I have looked and seen the trouble my people have in Egypt. I have heard them crying and I have come to make them free. Now come, I will send you to Egypt."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">This is the same Moses the people would not accept when they said, "Who made you our ruler and our judge?" This is the one God sent to be their ruler and to make them free when he spoke through the angel in the small tree.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">It was Moses who led the people out of Egypt. He had done wonderful things and signs there, and in the Red Sea, and in the wilderness, for forty years.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">This is the same Moses who said, "God will raise up one of your brothers to be a prophet, as he did me. Listen to him."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">This is the same Moses who was with Gods people in the wilderness at the hill called Mount Sinai. He was with the angel who spoke to him on Mount Sinai, and with our fathers of long ago.It was he who received the words of life to give to us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">Our fathers would not obey Moses. They did not want him to lead them. They wished they were back in Egypt.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">They said to Aaron, "Make gods to lead us. We do not know what has happened to this Moses who brought us out of Egypt."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">They made a young cow at that time and gave sacrifices to this god which was not the true God. They were very happy. What they had made pleased them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">Then God turned away from them. He let them worship the sun, moon, and the many stars in the sky. The prophets of God wrote about it long ago. They said, "You people of Israel, did you sacrifice animals to me forty years in the wilderness?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">You carried the house of the god called Moloch and the star of the god called Rephan.  You made gods of them to worship. I will carry you away to the other side of Babylon."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">Our fathers had the tent for the laws of God in the wilderness. It was built the way God showed Moses to make it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">Our fathers brought that tent with them when they came to this country. Joshua was their leader. God put aside the people who lived here first. Our fathers kept that tent with them until the time of David.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">God blessed David who asked God to let him make a better house for Jacobs God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">But it was Solomon who built a house for him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">But even so, God is above all. He does not live in houses that people make with their hands. The prophet says,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">"The Lord said, The sky is the big chair from which I rule. I put my feet on the earth. So then, what kind of house will you build for me? Or where will I rest myself?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">I have made all these things myself.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="51">You hard-hearted people! You have hearts and ears like the people who are not Jews.  You always fight against the Holy Spirit just as your fathers did long ago.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="52">What did your fathers do to the prophets of God? They made a lot of trouble for every one of them. They killed the ones who told that the Right and True One would come. He is the One you gave up to be killed. You are the killers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="53">You received the law given by angels, but you have not kept it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="54">When the men heard what Stephen said, they were very angry. They made noises with their teeth to show they hated him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="55">But Stephen was full of the Holy Spirit. He looked at the sky and saw the greatness of God. He saw Jesus standing at Gods right side.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="56">Look, he said, I see the sky open. I see the Son of man standing at Gods right hand side.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="57">Then the men shouted. They put their fingers in their ears. All together they ran at Stephen.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="58">They put him out of the city and threw stones at him. (Those who had talked against him laid their clothes down by the feet of a young man named Saul.)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="59">They kept on throwing stones at Stephen. He spoke to God and said, Oh, Lord Jesus,  receive my spirit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="60">Then he kneeled down and said in a loud voice, Lord, do not punish them for this wrong thing they are doing, After he said this, he died.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="8">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Saul agreed to Stephen being killed. At that time the church people at Jerusalem had much trouble. The church people all went into Judea and Samaria. Only the apostles stayed on at Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Good men buried Stephen. They were very sad because he died.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Saul made much trouble for the church people. He went into every house, pulled out men and women, and put them into prison.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">The people who left Jerusalem went all around telling the good news about Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Then Philip went to the city of Samaria and told people about Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And all the people together listened to what Philip said because they heard and saw the big works which he did.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Many people who were held by bad spirits were made free from them. The spirits came out of them crying loudly. Many other sick people were healed too. People who could not stand, and others who were lame, were healed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">The people all over the city were very glad.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">But there was one man named Simon, a witch-doctor, who fooled the people of Samaria.  He tried to make people believe that he could do big things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And all the people, young and old, listened to him. They said, This man is a big power of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">He had fooled them for a long time with his work as a witch. That is why they listened to him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">But Philip came and told them about Gods kingdom and the name of Jesus Christ. The people believed him. Then both men and women were baptised.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Simon believed also. When he was baptised, he went with Philip. He was very much surprised when he saw the signs and the big works which were done.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Then the apostles at Jerusalem heard that the people of Samaria believed Gods word. So they sent Peter and John to them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">When they came to them, they prayed for them to receive the Holy Spirit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Until that time, none of the people there had received the Holy Spirit. They had only been baptised in the name of the Lord Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Then the apostles put their hands on the people and they received the Holy Spirit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Simon saw that the people received the Holy Spirit when the apostles put their hands on them. Then he brought money to the apostles.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">He said, Give me this power, too, so that anyone on whom I put my hands will receive the Holy Spirit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Peter said, May you and your money be destroyed! You thought that you could buy the gift of God with money.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">You have no part in this matter. You cannot have any of this because God sees that your heart is not right.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Stop your wrong ways. Ask the Lord. Perhaps God will forgive you for the wrong things you wanted to do.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">I see that you are very bitter. Your wrong ways control you all together.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Simon said, Ask the Lord for me, so that none of the things you have talked about will happen to me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">The apostles told the people the word of the Lord. Then they went back to Jerusalem. On the way they told the good news in many villages in Samaria.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">The angel of the Lord spoke to Philip. Get up, said the angel. Go south to the road that goes from Jerusalem to Gaza. It is desert there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">So Philip went. He saw a man from the country of Ethiopia. This man was a servant of Candace, the queen of the Ethiopian people. She gave this servant much power. He took care of her money. He had gone to Jerusalem to worship.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Now he was on his way back. He sat in his carriage reading from the book which was written long ago by Isaiah, the prophet of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">The Spirit of the Lord said to Stephen, Go over to that man in the carriage.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">So Philip went running to him. He heard him reading from the book of the prophet Isaiah.  Do you understand what you are reading? Philip asked.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">How can I? I have no man to teach me, he answered. He asked Philip to get into the carriage and ride with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">This is what he was reading: He was led as a sheep to be killed. A lamb says nothing while its wool is being cut, so he also says nothing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">He was put down very low. He was not allowed to have a proper trial. He had no children to follow after him. For his life is taken from the earth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Then the man from Ethiopia asked Philip, Please tell me, who is the prophet talking about, himself or some other man?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">Then Philip told him about Jesus. He began with what the man read in the book.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">While they were going along, they came to some water by the road. The man said, See,  here is water. What is there to stop me from being baptised?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">Philip answered, If you believe with all your heart, you may be baptised. The man said,  I do believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">The man told the driver to stop. Then both he and Philip went down into the water, and Philip baptised him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">When they came up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord took Philip away. The man did not see him again, but he went on his way and was very happy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">Next, Philip came to the town of Azotus. He told the good news in all the cities through which he passed. Then he came to Caesarea.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="9">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Saul was still very angry with the Lords disciples. He said he would kill them. He went to the high priest.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">He asked him for letters to take to the meeting places at Damascus. In this way he was given the power to catch any men or women disciples. He could tie them and bring them back to Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">He went on his way. All at once, near the city of Damascus, a light from the sky shone around him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">He fell to the ground and heard someone say, Saul, Saul, why are you troubling me?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Saul said, Who are you, Lord? The Lord said, I am Jesus. You are troubling me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But get up and go to the city. There you will be told what you must do.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">The men who had come with Saul stood there. They did not say a word. They heard a voice but did not see anyone.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Saul got up off the ground. When he opened his eyes, he was blind. They took his hand and led him to Damascus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">For three days he could not see, and he did not eat or drink.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">A disciple named Ananias lived in Damascus. The Lord came to him in a vision and said.  Ananias. He replied, Here I am, Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">The Lord said, Go into the street which is called Straight. At the house of Judas, ask for a man named Saul, from the city of Tarsus. He is there, talking with God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">In a vision he has seen a man named Ananias coming to him. He has seen him put his hands on him so that he may see again.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Then Ananias replied, Lord, often I have heard of this man. He has brought much trouble to your people at Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">The chief priests have given him power in this city to put into prison all those who call on your name.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">The Lord said, Go, I have chosen him to take my name to the people who are not Jews,  to kings, and to the people of Israel also.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">I will show him how much he must suffer for my names sake.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Then Ananias went. He went into the house and put his hands on Saul. He said, Brother Saul, the Lord Jesus came to you on the road while you were coming here. He has sent me to you so that you may see again, and that you may be filled with the Holy Spirit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">At once some kind of skin which had covered Sauls eyes came off. He was able to see again from then on. He got up and was baptised.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And when he had eaten food, he was strong again. Saul stayed for some days with the disciples at Damascus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Right away he went to the Jewish meeting places and told the people that Jesus is the Son of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">All the people who heard him were surprised. They said, This man killed the people who called on Jesus name in Jerusalem. He came here to catch them and tie them and take them to the chief priests!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">But Saul became stronger and stronger. He proved that Jesus is the Christ and made it so plain that the Jews at Damascus did not know what to say.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Then some time after that, the leaders of the Jews planned to kill Saul.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">But he found out that they were waiting for him. The Jewish leaders watched the gates of the city night and day. They were waiting for a chance to kill him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Then one night the disciples put him in a basket and let him down outside the city wall.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">When Saul came to Jerusalem, he wanted to join the disciples, but they were all afraid of him. They did not believe that he was a disciple.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">But Barnabas took him and brought him to the apostles. He told them, Saul has seen the Lord on the road. The Lord has talked to him. After that he told Gods word in the name of Jesus, without fear at Damascus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">So Saul stayed with the apostles and went around in Jerusalem. He told Gods word in the name of the Lord Jesus without fear.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">He talked to the Jews who spoke the Greek language. But they did not agree with Saul,  and so they made plans to kill him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">When the Christian brothers knew that, they took him to Caesarea. Then they sent him to Tarsus &lt;FI&gt;the city where he was born&lt;Fi&gt; .</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">After that, the churches in Judea, Galilee, and Samaria were not troubled any more and they believed more strongly. The people obeyed the Lord, and the Holy Spirit helped them to believe. And many more people joined them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">While Peter was travelling through all the towns, he came to visit Gods people who lived in the city of Lydda.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">There he saw a man named Aeneas who was sick. He could not stand up. He had been on his bed for eight years.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="35">All the people who lived at Lydda and Sharon saw him, and they turned to the Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">In the city of Joppa there was a disciple. Her name was Tabitha. That means Dorcas or Gazelle. She did much good work and she gave many things to the poor people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">She became sick and died. They bathed her body and put her in a room upstairs.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">Lydda was near Joppa. When the disciples heard that Peter was at Lydda, they sent two men and asked for him to come quickly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">Peter got up and went with them. When he got there, they took him to the room upstairs.  Women whose husbands were dead stood there crying. They showed Peter the clothes and coats that Dorcas had made for them while she was with them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">Peter put them all out. He kneeled down and talked to God. He turned to the body and said, Tabitha, get up. She opened her eyes. When she saw Peter, she sat up.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">He took her hand and helped her get up. Then he called in Gods people and the women,  and he gave her back to them alive.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">All over Joppa people heard about this. Many people believed on the Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">Peter stayed in Joppa for many days. He was with a man named Simon, who made skins into leather.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="10">
      <VERS vnumber="1">In Caesarea lived a man named Cornelius. He was a big captain in the army. His soldiers were called the Italian Group.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">He was a good man. He and all the people of his house obeyed God. He gave many gifts to the poor. He always talked with God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">About three oclock one afternoon, he clearly saw an angel from God coming to him in a vision. Cornelius, said the angel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Cornelius looked at him. He was afraid and asked, What is it, Sir? The angel answered him, God has heard what you said to him. He has remembered your gifts to the poor.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Send men to Joppa to call Simon, whose other name is Peter.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">He is staying with Simon, the man who makes skins into leather. His house is by the sea.  Peter will tell you what you should do.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">When the angel which spoke to him had gone, Cornelius called two of his house servants.  He also called one of the soldiers who believed in God and who always helped him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">He told them carefully all about his vision. Then he sent them to Joppa.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">They went the next day. They were coming near to the city. About midday, Peter went up on the flat roof of the house to talk with God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">He became very hungry and wanted to eat. While food was being made ready, something like a dream came over him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">He saw the sky open. A bundle like a big blanket was tied by the corners. It was let down to earth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">In the bundle were all kinds of animals and snakes and birds.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Then Peter heard a voice saying to him, Get up, Peter. Kill some and eat.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">But Peter said, No, Lord, for I have never eaten anything that is not holy or not clean.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Then the voice spoke to him again, saying, What God has made clean you must not call unholy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">This happened three times. Then the thing was taken up right away into the sky.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">I have seen a strange thing, Peter said to himself. I wonder what it all means. He was thinking about all this. And the men whom Cornelius sent had asked the way to Simons house. Now they stood at the gate.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="19">Peter was still thinking about what he had seen. Then the Spirit of God said to him,  Three men are looking for you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Get up. Go down and go with them. Do not fear to go, because I have sent them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Then Peter went down to the men whom Cornelius had sent to him. He said, Here I am.  You are looking for me. Why have you come?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">They answered, God sent a holy angel to Cornelius. He told him to call you to his house and hear what you have to say. Cornelius is a captain in the army. He is a good man. He does what is right and obeys God. All the Jews speak well of him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Peter said, Come in. He had them stay as his guests. The next day he and some of the Christian brothers from Joppa went with the men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">The day after that, they reached Caesarea. Cornelius was waiting for them. He had called his family and close friends together.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Peter was about to enter the house. Cornelius met him. He kneeled down at his feet and worshipped him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">But Peter raised him up and said, Please stand up. I too am only a man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Peter talked to him and went in with him. He saw many people who had come together.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">He began to talk with them. He said, You yourselves know it is against our law for a Jew to visit and be friends with someone who is not a Jew. But God has shown me that I should not call any man unholy or unclean.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">So when you sent for me, I did not say "No". Now I ask, why did you send for me?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Cornelius answered, Four days ago, it was just at this time, three oclock. I was in my house talking with God. I had not eaten any food. A man stood in front of me wearing shining clothes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">He said to me, "Cornelius, God has heard what you said to him. He has remembered your gifts to the poor.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">Send men to Joppa to call for Simon Peter. He is staying with Simon, the man who makes skins into leather. His house is by the sea."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">So I sent for you right away. You have done well to come. Now we are all here before God to hear all that the Lord has told you to tell me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Then Peter began to speak, I really understand now. God does not love some people more than others.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">But he takes anyone who obeys him. He takes anyone who does what is right. It does not matter to what nation they belong.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">To the people of Israel God has sent the good news. He gives peace through Jesus Christ.  He is Lord of all!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">You yourselves know the story of what happened all through Judea. It started in Galilee after the baptism which John talked about.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">God gave Jesus of Nazareth the Holy Spirit and power. Jesus went about doing good deeds. He healed all those who were held by the devil. God was with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">We saw all the things which he did in the land of the Jews and in Jerusalem. And they hung him on a piece of wood and killed him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">On the third day, God raised him up to let people see him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">Not all the people saw him. But God had chosen us to see and to talk about him. We saw him. We ate and drank with him after he rose from death.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">He told us to tell the people that God chose him to judge both the living people and the dead people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">All the prophets tell about him. They say, "Everyone who believes in him will have his wrong ways forgiven through his name."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">While Peter was saying this, the Holy Spirit came on all those who heard the message.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">The believers who came with Peter were Jews. They were very much surprised that the Holy Spirit was also sent to those who were not Jews. 46,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">They heard them speak in tongues of other languages and praise God. Then Peter said,  These people have received the Holy Spirit just as we have. Can anyone say they may not be baptised in water?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">So he said they were to be baptised in the name of Jesus Christ. They begged him to stay with them for a while.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="11">
      <VERS vnumber="1">The apostles and other Christian brothers were in Judea. They heard that some people who were not Jews had also believed Gods message.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">When Peter went back to Jerusalem, the leaders of the Jews found fault with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">They asked, Why did you visit people who are not Jews? Why did you eat with them?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Peter explained to them all that had happened from the beginning.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">I was in the city of Joppa talking with God, he said. Something like a dream came over me. I saw a vision. I saw a bundle like a big blanket tied by the corners. It was let down from the sky. It came down to me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">When I looked at it, I wondered about it. I saw different kinds of tame animals, wild animals, snakes, and birds.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And I heard a voice say to me, "Get up, Peter. Kill some and eat."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">But I said, "No, Lord, for I have never eaten anything that is not holy or clean."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Then the voice spoke from the sky a second time, saying, "What God has made clean,  you must not call unholy."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">This happened three times. Then everything was taken up into the sky again.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Right then three men came to the house where we were. They had come from Caesarea for me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">The Spirit told me to go with them and not to fear. These six brothers went with me too.  We went into the mans house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">He told us that he had seen Gods angel standing in his house. The angel said to him,  "Send men to Joppa to call Simon whose other name is Peter.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">He will tell you and all your family how to be saved."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And when I began to speak, the Holy Spirit came on them just as he had come on us at the beginning.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Then I remembered that the Lord said, "John baptised with water, but you will be baptised with the Holy Spirit."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">God gave then the same gift as he gave to us who believed on the Lord Jesus Christ. If God gave them this gift, how could I stop him? I am only a man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">When the people heard this, they were satisfied. They praised God saying, God has allowed the people who are not Jews to turn to him and live.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Some of the people had gone to other countries because of the big trouble when Stephen was killed. They went as far as Phoenicia, Cyprus, and Antioch. They told Gods word to the Jews only.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Some of them were men of Cyprus and Cyrene. They went to Antioch. They also spoke to those who were not Jews, and they told them about the Lord Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">The Lord was with them. Many believed and turned to the Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">The people in the Jerusalem church heard this news. They sent Barnabas to go to Antioch.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">When he reached there, he saw what had been done by the power of God. He was very glad. He talked to them. He begged them all to keep on following the Lord with all their heart.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Barnabas was a good man. He believed in God and was filled with the Holy Spirit. Many people came to the Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Then Barnabas went to Tarsus to get Saul.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">When he found him, he took him to Antioch. For a whole year they met with all who believed in Jesus Christ. They taught many people. Antioch was the first place where the disciples were called Christians.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">At that time, prophets came from Jerusalem to Antioch.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">One of them named Agabus stood up. He told them the Spirit had shown him that much trouble would come to all the world. There would not be much food for the people. (This trouble came when Claudius Caesar was ruler.)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Then the disciples decided to help the Christian brothers who lived in Judea. They would each one send what he could.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">They did so. They sent Barnabas and Saul to carry it to the church leaders &lt;FI&gt;in Jerusalem&lt;Fi&gt; .</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="12">
      <VERS vnumber="1">At that time Herod the king caught some of the church people and troubled them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">He killed James the brother of John with a long knife or sword.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">He saw that this pleased the leaders of the Jews, so he caught Peter also. This happened at the Jewish feast which they had each year to remember leaving Egypt. (It was called the Passover Feast.)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">After Herod had caught Peter, he put him in prison. He told four groups of soldiers to guard him. There were four soldiers in each group. He planned to bring him out for trial before the people. But he would do it after the Passover Feast.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">So Peter was kept in prison. And the church people asked God to help him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">The night before Herod was going to bring him out, Peter was sleeping between two soldiers. He was tied to them with two chains. Guards were at the door of the prison.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">An angel from the Lord came to him and a light shone in the prison. He hit Peters side and woke him up. Be quick, he said. Get up! His chains fell off his hands.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Put on your belt and your shoes, said the angel. Peter did so. And now, said the angel,  put on your coat and follow me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Peter followed him out. He did not know that what the angel had done was true. He thought he was dreaming.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">They passed the first and the second guard. Then they came to the iron gate out to the city. It opened for them by itself. So they went all the way down a street. Then the angel left him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">When Peter came to himself, he said, Now I know truly that the Lord has sent his angel.  He has saved me from Herod and from all that the Jewish leaders are hoping will happen to me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And when he thought about this, he went to Marys house. Mary was John Marks mother. Many people were meeting there, talking to God &lt;FI&gt;about Peter&lt;Fi&gt; .</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Peter knocked at the outside door. A young servant woman named Rhoda went to answer.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">When she knew it was Peters voice, she was very glad. She did not open the door. But she ran in and told the people that Peter was at the door.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">They said, You are crazy. But she kept on saying that Peter was really there. Then they said, It must be his angel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Peter kept on knocking. When they opened the door and saw him, they were very much surprised.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">He put out his hand for them to be quiet. Then he told them how the Lord had brought him out of the prison. He said, Tell James and the brothers about this. Then he went away to another place.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">In the morning the soldiers tried hard to find Peter.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Herod had looked for him and had not found him. So he questioned the guards and ordered them to be taken away and killed. And then Peter went from Judea to Caesarea to live for a while.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Now Herod was angry with the people of Tyre and Sidon. But they got Blastus to speak to the king for them. Blastus was one of the men who worked in the kings house. They came to Herod together. They wanted to make peace with him because their country got its food from his country.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">On a certain day Herod put on his kings robes and sat on his chair and made a speech.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">The people shouted, A god is talking to us. He is not a man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">At once an angel from God put a bad sickness on Herod because he did not give God the praise. Worms ate him and he died.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">The word of God spread further and further and more people believed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Barnabas and Saul returned from Jerusalem when they had finished their work. They brought John Mark with them.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="13">
      <VERS vnumber="1">In the church at Antioch there were prophets and teachers. They were Barnabas, Simeon Niger, Lucius from Cyrene, Manaen who grew up with Herod the ruler, and Saul.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">They were worshipping the Lord and fasting &lt;FI&gt;not eating food for a time&lt;Fi&gt; . The Holy Spirit said, Give me Barnabas and Saul to do the work for which I have called them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">The men fasted and talked to God. Then they laid their hands on Barnabas and Paul and sent them on their way.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Barnabas and Saul left Antioch. The Holy Spirit sent them to the town of Seleucia. From there they went in a boat to the island of Cyprus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">When they reached the town of Salamis, they told Gods word in the meeting places of the Jews. John was with them to help.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">They went through all the island to the town of Paphos. There they met a witch doctor.  He was a Jew named Bar-Jesus. He was not a true prophet.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">This witch-doctor was with Sergius Paulus, the ruler of the country. Sergius Paulus was a wise man. He wanted to hear Gods word, so he called for Barnabas and Saul.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">The witch-doctor was also called Elymas. He tried to stop them. He did not want the ruler to believe the truth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Then Saul, who is also called Paul, being filled with the Holy Spirit, looked at him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">You son of the devil! he said. You do nothing but tell lies and make much trouble. You hate everything that is right. The Lords way is right. Will you not stop spoiling his way?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">See now, the Lords hand is upon you. You will be blind and will not be able to see the sun for a while. And right then something like a dark cloud came over Elymas eyes. He went around begging someone to take his hand and lead him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">The ruler saw what had happened. And he was very much surprised at the teaching about the Lord. He believed it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Paul and his friends left Paphos in a boat. They went to the town of Perga in the district of Pamphylia. There John left them and went back to Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">The others went on from Perga. They came to Antioch in the district of Pisidia. On the Sabbath day they went into the meeting house and sat down.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">First, someone read from the books of the law and the prophets. Then the rulers of the meeting house called Paul and Barnabas and said, Men and brothers, have you something to say that will help us? Please say it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Then Paul stood up and put out his hand. He said, Men of Israel and you who worship and fear God, please listen to me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">The God of the people of Israel chose our fathers. He made the people into a large tribe when they were strangers in the land of Egypt. God brought them out of Egypt by his power.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">For forty years in the wilderness God cared for them like a father.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">God took seven tribes out of the land of Canaan. Then he divided the land among our people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">God gave judges to rule over them until Samuel the prophet came. About four hundred and fifty years had passed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Then the people asked for a king. God gave them Saul. He was the son of Kish, a man from Benjamins family. Saul was their king for forty years.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Then God took him away. He made David king over them. This is what God said about him, "David, Jesses son, is the kind of man I love. He will do all that I want him to do."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">God has given Israel a Saviour from Davids family, as he promised to do. His name is Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Before he came, John &lt;FI&gt;the baptiser&lt;Fi&gt; talked to all the people of Israel. He said they should stop doing wrong things and be baptised.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">When John was finishing his work, he said, "Who do you think I am? I am not the one.  But wait, someone else will come after me. I am not good enough to untie his shoe strings."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Men and brothers, sons of Abraham, and all of you who worship God, the news of this way to be saved has been sent to us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">The people who live in Jerusalem and their rulers did not know who this Jesus really was.  They did not understand the words of the prophets of God long ago which were read every Sabbath day. But even so, they did what the prophets had said they would do.  They judged him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">They could not prove that he did anything wrong for which he should die. Yet they begged Pilate to kill him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">They did all the things that the prophets had written about him. Then they took him down from the cross made from a tree. They laid him in a grave cut from the rock.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">But God raised him from death.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">People had come with Jesus from Galilee to Jerusalem. They saw him many days. Now they tell people what they saw.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">And we are bringing you this good news. God made a promise to our fathers long ago.  Now he has made his promise come true.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">We, their children, have now received the promise. He sent Jesus just as it was written in the second psalm, "You are my Son. Today I have become your Father."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">God raised Jesus from death. His body did not go back to the grave to be spoiled. Here is what God said about it. "I will give to you the blessings which I promised David."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">In another psalm it says, "You will not let the body of your Holy One be spoiled."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">As for David, he did the work God wanted him to do for the people in his time. Then,  after that, he died. He was buried with his fathers. His body spoiled.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">But God has raised one from death. His body did not spoil.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">Men and brothers, understand this. It is because of this Jesus that we tell you your wrong ways will be forgiven you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">The law of Moses could not make you free. But this man makes you free. You will not be judged if you believe in him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">Be careful then, so that what the prophets said will not happen to you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">They said, "Look, you people who despise everything. You will look in wonder before you die. I will do something in your time. I will do something that you will not believe even if someone told you what it is."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">As Paul and Barnabas left the meeting house the people said, Tell us these things again next Sabbath day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">The meeting was finished. There were many Jews, also those who were not Jews but worshipped God. They followed Paul and Barnabas. Paul and Barnabus kept talking to the people and told them to keep on living in the way that will bring Gods blessing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">The next Sabbath day almost all of the people in that city gathered to hear Gods word.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">The leaders of the Jews saw that many people came. They were very jealous. They talked back to Paul and said he was not telling the truth. They also said wrong things about him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">But Paul and Barnabas did not fear the Jewish leaders. They said, We had to tell Gods word to you first but you will not listen to it. By that you are saying you Jews are not good enough to live for ever. So we will go to the people who are not Jews.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">That is what the Lord told us to do. He said, "I have made you to be a light to the people who are not Jews. You will tell people everywhere in the world how to be saved."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">Those who were not Jews heard this. They were glad and they thanked God for his message. All those who had been chosen to live for ever believed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">The word of the Lord was told through all that part of the country.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">But the leaders of the Jews talked to the leading women who worshipped God and to the chief men of Antioch. They made plenty of trouble for Paul and Barnabas. They made them leave that part of the country.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="51">So Paul and Barnabas shook the dust off their feet and left them. They went on to Iconium.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="52">And the followers were filled with joy and the Holy Spirit.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="14">
      <VERS vnumber="1">In Iconium Paul and Barnabas did as they had done before in other places. They went into the Jews meeting place and spoke. Many of the Jews and the other people believed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">But the Jews who did not believe said wrong things about them. They spoiled the minds of those who were not Jews so that they hated the Christians.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Paul and Barnabas stayed there a long time anyway. They did not fear to talk about the Lord. The Lord proved that the message about his blessing was true. He worked through Paul and Barnabas. They did signs and wonderful things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">The people of the city were divided. Some of them agreed with the Jewish leaders. Some of them agreed with the apostles.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Then some of those people who were not Jews joined together with the Jews and their leaders. They made a plan to give the apostles much trouble and to kill them with stones.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Paul and Barnabas found out about this. So they left quickly. They went to Lystra and Derbe in the district of Lycaonia and the country around.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">There they told people the good news.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">At Lystra a man was sitting. He was not able to walk because he had no strength in his feet. He had never walked since he was born.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">This man heard Paul speak. Paul looked at the man. He saw that the man believed he would be healed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Paul said, Stand up on your feet! The man jumped up and walked.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">When the people saw what Paul had done, they shouted in their own language, The gods have become like men! They have come down to visit us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">They named Barnabas, Jupiter. And they named Paul, Mercury, because he was the one who talked.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">There was a temple of Jupiter in front of the city. The priest of the temple brought animals and flowers to the gates to make a sacrifice. All the people were with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">But when the apostles, Barnabas and Paul, heard of it, they tore their clothes and ran in among the people shouting.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">They said, Why are you people doing this? We are only men like you. You should leave these gods which cannot help you. You should turn to the living God. He made the sky,  the earth, the sea, and all that is in them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">In the time that is past, God allowed all people to do what they wanted to do.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">But even then he had some ways to make himself known. He did things that were good.  He gave us rain from the sky and good harvests. And he gives you all the food you need and makes you very happy. Surely these things speak for him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">By saying these things they stopped the people from making sacrifices to them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Some of the Jewish leaders from Antioch and Iconium came to Lystra and won the people to their side. They threw stones at Paul. Then they carried him out of the city because they thought he was dead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">But as the disciples gathered around him, he got up and they went back into the city. The next day Paul and Barnabas left and went to Derbe.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">They told the good news to the people in Derbe. Many people believed what they taught.  Then they went back to Lystra, to Iconium. and to Antioch.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">They talked to the disciples to help them. They told them to keep on believing. They said,  We must go through much trouble to get into Gods kingdom.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">They chose leaders for them in every church. They talked with God and fasted. When they were finished, they gave the leaders over to the Lords care, because they believed in him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">They went through the district of Pisidia to Pamphylia.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">They told the good news to the people in Perga. Then they went to the town of Attalia.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">From there they went in a boat to Antioch. It was there that the people had given them over to Gods care. They had asked him to bless them in this work. Now they had finished the work.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">When they reached the city, they called all the church people together. They told them all that God had done for them. They said, Now God has opened the way to believe for those who are not Jews.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Paul and Barnabas stayed a long time with the disciples at Antioch.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="15">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Some men came from Judea and taught the Christian brothers. They said, You must be circumcised with the mark made on your body in the way Moses taught us. If you are not circumcised you cannot be saved.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Paul and Barnabas did not agree with them. There was much talking about it. Then they decided that Paul and Barnabas and some of the other men should go to Jerusalem. They would ask the apostles and church leaders there about it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">So the church people sent them on their way. They passed through the districts of Phoenicia and Samaria. They told them that some who were not Jews were believing in God. This news made all the Christian brothers very happy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">When they reached Jerusalem, they were welcomed by the church people, the apostles,  and the church leaders. They told all that God had done as he worked with them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">But some of the believers who belonged to the Pharisee group stood up and said, They must be circumcised &lt;FI&gt;like the Jews&lt;Fi&gt; . We must tell them to keep all the laws of Moses.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">The apostles and the church leaders met together to talk the matter over.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">After much talking about it, Peter stood up. He said, Men and brothers, you know what happened in the first days. God chose me to tell the good news to those who are not Jews. They believed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">God knows what is in a persons heart. He proved that they believed. He gave them the Holy Spirit just as he did to us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">God made no difference between them and us. He made their hearts clean when they believed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">So now why are you doing what God did not do? You give the disciples a hard thing to do. Our fathers could not do it. And we cannot do it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">We believe that the Lord Jesus saves us because he is kind. And that is why he saves them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Then all the people stopped talking. They listened to what Paul and Barnabas had to say.  They told them about all the signs and wonderful things that God had helped them to do among the people who were not Jews.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">When they had finished talking, James said, Men and brothers, listen to me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Simeon has told us how God came the first time to the people who are not Jews. God chose some of them to belong to him and be his people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">This is what the prophets of God said long ago.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">They said, "After this, I will come back and build up again the house of David which has fallen down. I will take the broken pieces and build a house again.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Then all the other people will find God, even those who are not Jews but who belong to me. So says the Lord, who is doing all these things."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">He told us these things long ago.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">So now, this is what I think. We should not trouble those who are not Jews but who have turned to God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">We should write them a letter and tell them what they must not do. They must not eat food that has been given to idols. They must not have sex with someone who is not their husband or wife. They must not eat the meat of animals that are killed by choking. They must not taste blood.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Since the times of long ago there have been men who told about Moses in every city.  They read his laws in the meeting places every Sabbath day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Then the apostles, and the leaders, and all the church people chose men from among themselves. They sent them to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas. They chose Judas,  whose other name was Barsabbas, and Silas. They were leaders among the Christian brothers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">They sent a letter with them. It said, The apostles, the church leaders, and the Christian brothers send greetings to the Christians who are not Jews in Antioch, Syria, and Cilicia.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">We have heard that some of our people visited you and talked to you. They taught things that troubled you and made you believe wrong things. They said, "You must be circumcised like the Jews and keep the law." We did not tell them to teach you this.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">All of us gathered here have chosen some men. We are sending them with our dear brothers, Barnabas and Paul.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Barnabas and Paul have been willing to die for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">We are sending Judas and Silas. They will tell you the same things that we have written in the letter.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">The Holy Spirit and we thought it was not good to give you a hard thing to do. But here is what you must not do.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">You must not eat food that has been given to idols. You must not eat the meat of animals that are killed by choking. You must not taste blood. You must not commit adultery. If you keep away from these things, you will do well. Goodbye.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">So the men left and went to Antioch. There they called the people together and gave them the letter.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">When the people read the letter, they were very glad. It helped them to become stronger in what they believed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">Judas and Silas were prophets. They said many things to the Christian brothers and helped them to believe more strongly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">They stayed there for a while. Then the brothers sent them back to those who had sent them. They sent a greeting of peace with them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">But Silas thought it was good to stay at Antioch.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">Paul and Barnabas stayed there too. They taught the people and told them the Lords message. Many other men did this also.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">Some days later, Paul said to Barnabas, Let us go back and visit the brothers in every city where we have told the Lords message. Let us see how they are doing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">Barnabas wanted to take John Mark with them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">But Paul did not think that they should take him. John Mark had left them when they were at Pamphylia. He had not gone along with them to do the work.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">The feeling about this matter was very strong between Barnabas and Paul, so they did not go together. Barnabas took Mark and went in a boat to Cyprus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">Paul chose Silas. The Christian brothers asked the Lord to bless Paul. Then he went on his way.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">Paul travelled through Syria and Cilicia. He helped the church people to believe more strongly.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="16">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Then he came to Derbe and Lystra. A disciple named Timothy was there. His mother was a Jew, a believer, and his father was a Greek.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">The Christian brothers at Lystra and Iconium spoke very well of Timothy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Paul wanted him to go with him. He circumcised him because all the Jews in those places knew that his father was a Greek.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">They went from town to town and talked to the people. They told them what the apostles and church leaders at Jerusalem had said should be done. So the church people became stronger in what they believed. Every day more people joined the church.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">missing fehlt/missing</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Paul and Silas went through the district of Phrygia and Galatia. The Holy Spirit said they should not tell Gods word in the country of Asia Minor.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">After they came to the district of Mysia, they wanted to go to the country of Bithynia but the Holy Spirit did not allow them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">So they went by Mysia and came to the city of Troas.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">In the night Paul had a vision: he saw a picture like a dream. He saw a man of Macedonia standing and calling to him, Come over into Macedonia and help us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">After Paul had seen the vision, we tried to leave for Macedonia right away. We believed that the Lord had called us to tell the people there the good news.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">So we left Troas in a boat and went straight across the water to the town of Samothrace.  The next day we went to Neapolis.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">From there we went to Philippi. This was the big city of the district of Macedonia. It was a free city. We stayed there for some time.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">On the Sabbath day we went out of the city to the river. We thought this was a place where people met to talk with God. So we sat down and talked to the women who had come there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">One woman named Lydia listened to us. She was from the city of Thyatira, and she sold red cloth. She worshipped God. He worked in her heart and she believed what Paul said.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">She and all the people in her house were baptised. Then she begged us and said, If you really feel that I believe in the Lord, come and stay at my house. And she would not allow us to say no.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">One day we were going to the meeting place where people talked with God. We met a girl who had a bad spirit. She used to tell people what was going to happen. Her masters received much money when she did this.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">This girl kept on following Paul and us. She was shouting, These men are servants of the High God. They are telling us how to be saved.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">She did this for many days. This troubled Paul. He turned and said to the spirit in her, In the name of Jesus Christ, I say to you, come out of her! And the spirit came out at once.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Her masters saw that they had lost this way of getting money. They caught Paul and Silas and took them by force to the rulers in the court.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">When they had brought them before the judges, they said, These men are Jews. And they are making much trouble in our city.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">They are teaching people laws which we may not obey because we are Roman people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">All the people standing around were against Paul and Silas. The judges tore off the clothes of Paul and Silas. They gave orders that they should be beaten.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">They beat them very hard. Then they put them in prison. Take care, they said to the prison guard. Be sure that these prisoners do not run away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And so the guard put them in the back room in the prison. They locked their feet in holes cut in heavy pieces of wood.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">At midnight, Paul and Silas were talking with God. They were singing and praising God.  The other prisoners were listening to them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Then all of a sudden the earth shook very much. Even the floor of the prison was shaking. All the doors came wide open. The things that held the prisoners all came off.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">The prison guard woke up. He saw all the prison doors open. So he took a long knife and was going to kill himself. He thought that all the prisoners had run away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Paul shouted, Stop! Do not hurt yourself. We are all here!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">The guard called for a light and went in quickly. He kneeled down before Paul and Silas,  trembling with fear.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">He brought them out of the prison and said, Sirs, what must I do to be saved?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">They replied, Believe in the Lord Jesus Christ and you will be saved. All the people in your house must do the same.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">They talked to him and all the people in the house. They told them the word of the Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">Paul and Silas had sores from the beating in prison. So that same hour of the night the guard washed them. Then he and all the people of his house were baptised.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">He took Paul and Silas to his home and gave them food to eat. He and all the people in his house were very happy. They now believed in God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">In the morning the judges sent soldiers to the guard with a message. Let those men go free, they said.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">The guard told Paul. He said, The judges have sent a message that you may go free. So now, come out and go on your way. You will have no more trouble.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">But Paul said, We are Romans. And they have beaten us outside where people can see.  They have put us in prison without proving we have done wrong. Now, are they going to take us out of prison secretly? No, they themselves must come and take us out.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">The soldiers told this to the judges. They were very much afraid when they heard that Paul and Silas were Romans.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">So they came to Paul and Silas. They said they were sorry for what they had done. They brought them out of prison and asked them to leave the city.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">When Paul and Silas came out of prison, they went back to Lydias house. They saw their Christian brothers and talked to them. This helped the Christians to believe more strongly.  Then Paul and Silas went on their way.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="17">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Paul and Silas went through the cities of Amphipolis and Apollonia. Then they reached the town of Thessalonica. Here the Jews had a meeting place.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">As he had done in other places, Paul went into it. On three Sabbath days he explained what was written in the holy writings.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">He proved these things from the writings. He said. It was necessary for the Christ to suffer and to rise again from death. And this Jesus, whom I am talking about, is the Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Some of the people believed him and they followed Paul and Silas. Some of them were Greek people who worshipped God. And some were leading women.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">But some Jews did not believe, and they were jealous. So they called some of the bad men together and made a crowd. They started to fight and to make plenty of trouble and noise in the city. At Jasons house they went in by force to find Paul and Silas. They wanted to bring them outside to the people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But they did not find them. So they took Jason and some of the Christian brothers to the rulers of the city. They shouted, These men have turned the world upside down. Now they have come here also.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Jason has taken them into his house. None of them obeys the laws of Caesar. They say there is another king named Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">All the people and the rulers of the city became angry when they heard this.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">They made Jason and the other Christians pay much money. Then they let them go.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">That night the Christian brothers sent Paul and Silas to the town of Berea. When they reached there, they went into the Jews meeting place.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">The people in Berea were better than the people of Thessalonica. They were glad to listen to Pauls words. Every day they studied the holy writings to see if what Paul said was right.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Through this, many of them believed. Some of the leading women of the Greek people and some of the men also believed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">The leaders of the Jews in Thessalonica heard that Paul told the word of God to the people at Berea. They came to Berea and talked to the people. They said things that made the people very angry against Paul.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">The Christian brothers sent Paul to the seaside right away. But Silas and Timothy stayed on at Berea.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">The men took Paul to the city of Athens. Paul told them to tell Silas and Timothy to come to him as soon as they could.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Paul was waiting for Silas and Timothy at Athens. He saw that the city was full of idols.  His spirit was troubled about this.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">In the meeting place he talked with the Jews and those who believed in the true God. In the market every day, he talked to people he met there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">There were some wise men who believed the teachings of Epicurius. They believed the teaching of other wise men called Stoics. Some of them began to talk with Paul. And some said, What does this talker have to say? Others said, He seems to be talking about new gods. This was because he was telling them about Jesus and how he was raised from death.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">So they took Paul and brought him to a meeting at the hill called Areopagus. They said,  We want to know what this new teaching is that you are talking about.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">You are telling us things we never heard before. We want to understand them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">All the people of Athens and the strangers who lived there passed their time in one way.  They liked to tell and to hear some new thing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Then Paul stood up in the court and said, You men of Athens, I see that you are very religious and worship many gods.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">As I walked about, I looked at the things you worship. I saw one place where you make sacrifices. You have written on it, "To the God we do not know." You are worshipping that God, but you do not know him. I will tell you about him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">He made the world and everything in it. He is the Lord of the sky and the earth. He does not live in houses that people make with their hands.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Men cannot worship him by things they make with their hands because he does not need anything. He is the one who gives life and breath and everything else to all people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">God made one man. From that one man he has made all the nations of men to live on the whole earth. He has given to each nation a certain time and a certain place to live.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">He did this so they would look for him. He wanted them to reach out and find him. But he is not far from each one of us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">In him we live, and move, and are alive. Some of your own writers have said, "We have come from him".</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Therefore we have all come from God. So we should not think that God is something made of gold, or silver, or stone. He is not made by mens hands.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">In times past God did not look at what people did. They did not know any better then.  But now he is calling all people to stop doing those things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">God has set a day when he will judge the whole world in the right way. He has chosen a man to do this. He has proved to all people who the man is. He has raised him from death.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">When the people of Athens heard that someone had been raised from death, some of them laughed. Others said, We want to hear you talk about this matter again some time.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">So then Paul left them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">But some men followed him and believed. Among those who believed was Dionysius. He was a judge in the Areopagus court. And a woman named Damaris believed. There were others also.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="18">
      <VERS vnumber="1">After this Paul left Athens and went to the city of Corinth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">There he met a Jew named Aquila, born in Pontus. A short time before this he and his wife Priscilla had come from the country of Italy. They left Italy because Claudius the ruler had ordered all the Jews to leave Rome. This was the big city in Italy. Paul went to the house of Aquila and Priscilla.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Pauls work had been the making of tents, and that is what they did. So he stayed with them. They worked together.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Every Sabbath day he talked with the people in the meeting place for the Jews. He tried to talk so that the Jews and the Greeks would believe.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">When Silas and Timothy came from Macedonia, Paul felt in his heart that he must prove to the Jews that Jesus is the Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But the people talked back to Paul. And they said wrong things about him. Paul shook his clothes and said to them, If you are lost, it is your own fault, not mine! From now on I will go to those who are not Jews.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">So he left. He went to the house of a man named Justus who worshipped God. His house was next to the meeting place.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Crispus was the head ruler of the meeting house. He and his whole family believed in the Lord. Many of the people in Corinth heard and believed. And they were baptised.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">The Lord said to Paul in a vision in the night, Do not fear. Keep on speaking. Do not stop.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">I am with you. nobody will hurt you. I have many people in this city.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">So Paul stayed there for one year and six months. He taught the people Gods word.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">When Gallio was the ruler of the province of Achaia, the Jews got together to stop Paul.  They took him to court.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">They said, This man is talking to the people. He is trying to make them worship God in a way that is against our law.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Paul wanted to speak. Then Gallio said to the Jews, You Jews, if it were a matter of wrong or of doing something very bad, I would listen to you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">But this is a matter about words and names and about your own law. So you must go and take care of it yourselves! I will not judge such things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And he drove them out of the court.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">They caught a man. His name was Sosthenes. He was the head ruler of the meeting house. They beat him in front of the judge, but Gallio did nothing about it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Paul stayed there for many days. Then he said goodbye to the Christian brothers and went in a boat to the country of Syria. Priscilla and Aquila went with him. In the town of Cenchrea he cut his hair off. This was because he had made a promise to God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">When they reached the city of Ephesus, Paul left the others there. He himself went to the meeting place and talked with the Jews.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">The Jews begged him to stay longer but he would not stay.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Goodbye, he said. I will come back to you again if it is Gods will. Then he got in a boat and left Ephesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">When he reached Caesarea, he went to greet the church people. Then he went on to Antioch.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">He stayed there for a while. Then he left and went through all the countries of Galatia and Phrygia. He helped the disciples to believe more strongly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">A Jew came to Ephesus. His name was Apollos. He was born in Alexandria. He spoke with power and was able to explain the holy writings well.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">This man had been taught the way of the Lord. He was strong in spirit as he talked to people. What he taught them about the Lord was true. But he knew only about the baptism of John.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">He began to speak without fear in the meeting place. When Aquila and Priscilla heard him, they took him to their house. They explained the way of God so that he knew more about it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Apollos decided to go into Achaia. The Christian brothers wrote to the disciples there and asked them to receive him. When he reached Achaia, he helped very much those who believed. They believed because God was kind to them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">He talked strongly with the Jews before the people. He proved to them from the holy writings that Jesus is the Christ.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="19">
      <VERS vnumber="1">While Apollos was at Corinth, Paul went over land and came to the city of Ephesus.  There he met some disciples.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Paul asked them, Did you receive the Holy Spirit when you believed? They said, No.  We have not even heard that there is a Holy Spirit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Paul asked them, How were you baptised? They said, We were baptised in Johns way.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Then Paul said, John baptised people when they stopped their wrong ways. He told people that they should believe on the one who would follow him. That one is Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">When they heard this, they were baptised in the name of the Lord Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Paul put his hands on them. Then the Holy Spirit came on them and they spoke in tongues of other lang-uages and spoke words from God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">In all, there were about twelve men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Paul went into the meeting place. For three months he talked without fear to the people there. He tried to talk so that people would obey God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Some of them were fixed in their minds and would not believe. They said, The Christian way is not good They said this in front of all the people. So Paul left them and took the disciples away. He talked and answered the questions of the people every day in the school of a man named Tyrannus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">This went on for two years, and all the people who lived in the province of Asia, both the Jews and the Greeks, heard the Lords word.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">God did big works through Paul. Even some pieces of cloth he had touched were carried to sick people and they were healed. Also, people who had bad spirits in them were made free.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">missing fehlt/missing</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Some Jews were there who travelled about from place to place. They had power over bad spirits like witch-doctors. They tried to make people free from bad spirits by using the name of the Lord Jesus. They said to the spirits, I tell you, in the name of Jesus, the one Paul talks about, come out!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">There was a Jew named Sceva. He was a chief priest. He had seven sons who did this.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">But the bad spirit answered, I know Jesus and I know Paul. But who are you?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And the man who had the bad spirit in him jumped on them. He beat them all because he was stronger than they were. Their bodies were bleeding and their clothes were torn.  They ran out of the house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">When all the Jews and the Greeks at Ephesus knew about this, they all feared. And they had great respect for the name of the Lord Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Many of the people who believed, told God all the bad things they used to do.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Many had been witch-doctors. They brought their books and burned them in front of all the people. All the books together had cost about 50,000 silver coins.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Gods word spread with power. It reached more and more people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">After this, Paul decided he would go through Macedonia and Achaia and then to Jerusalem. After I have been there, he said, l must go to see the city of Rome also.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">He sent Timothy and Erastus, two of his helpers, into Macedonia. But he himself stayed in Asia Minor for a while.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">About that time there was much trouble because of the Christian way.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">A man named Demetrius made things from silver. He made little silver houses like the big house of the idol-god Diana. He and other men got much money from this work.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Demetrius called them all together. He said, Men, you know that we get our money from this work.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Now you see and hear how this man Paul has talked. He has turned away many people in Ephesus. Not only that, but he has turned away the hearts of many people in almost all of Asia Minor. He says that things made by mens hands are not really gods.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">This will spoil our work. Not only that, but people will not respect the house of the great idol goddess Diana any more. All the people in Asia and in the whole world worship her now. But they will despise her!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">When they heard this, the men were very angry and shouted, Great is Diana of Ephesus!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">All the people in the city were excited. They caught two men from Macedonia. Their names were Gaius and Aristarchus. They had travelled with Paul. Then they all rushed to the big meeting place with them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Paul wanted to go in and talk to the people, but the disciples would not let him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Some of the leaders in Asia Minor liked Paul. They sent word to him and begged him not to go into the meeting place.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">Some of the people were shouting one thing and some another. They were all stirred up.  Most of the people did not know why they had come together.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">The Jews pushed Alexander forward. Some of the people put him in front. He put up his hand and wanted to talk to the people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">But when they saw that he was a Jew, they all shouted together for two hours, Great is Diana of Ephesus!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">At last the city chief stopped the shouting. He said, Men of Ephesus, everyone knows that all the people of Ephesus take care of the house of the great Diana. And they take care of the stone which fell from the sky.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">No person can say it is not true. So you should be quiet and not do anything foolish.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">The men whom you have brought here have not taken anything from the house. They have not even said anything wrong about our goddess.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">Now then, if Demetrius and the men who work with him have any complaint, let them take it to law. We have a court and we have judges.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">If you want anything more than that, it must be done in a meeting which has been called by law.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">We may have trouble because of what has happened today. There is not one good reason for it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">When he had said this, he closed the meeting.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="20">
      <VERS vnumber="1">When everything was quiet, Paul called the disciples. He talked to them so they would not be afraid. Then he said goodbye and left. He went to Macedonia.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">He went through that country and talked to the people. He helped them to believe more strongly. Then he went to Greece.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">He stayed there for three months. When he was ready to go to Syria by boat, he heard that the Jewish leaders were planning to catch him. So he said, I will go back through Macedonia.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Some men went with him as far as Asia Minor. They were Sopater from Berea,  Aristarchus and Secundus from Thessalonica, Gaius from Derbe, and Timothy, and also Tychicus and Trophimus from Asia Minor.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">These went on ahead and waited for us at Troas.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">After the days of the Passover Feast, we left Philippi by boat. Five days later we met them in Troas. We stayed there for seven days.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">On the first day of the week the disciples met together to break bread. Paul was ready to leave the next day. He talked a long time to the people at the meeting until long into the night. They were gathered in an upstairs room with many lights.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">A young man named Eutychus sat in the window. He became very sleepy. When Paul kept talking so long, Eutychus was very deep in sleep and fell down from the third floor.  When the people picked him up he was dead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Paul went down stairs. He lay on him and put his arms around him. Do not fear, he said. He is alive.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Then Paul went upstairs again. He broke bread and ate some food. He talked for a long time, until daybreak. After that, he left.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">The people took the young man. They were very glad because he was alive.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">We went by boat to the town of Assos. We were going to meet Paul there and take him on the boat. He told us to do that because he wanted to walk.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">We met him at Assos, took him on the boat, and went to Mitylene.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Then we went by boat the next day and came to Chios. The next day we passed the town of Samos. We reached Miletus on the third day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Paul decided not to stop at Ephesus. He did not want to spend time in Asia Minor. He kept going as fast as he could, because he hoped to be at the feast in Jerusalem on the day of Pentecost.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">He sent a message from Miletus to Ephesus to call the leaders of the church to come to him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">When they came, he said, You know how I have lived all the time that I have been with you. I lived that way from the first day I came into Asia.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">You know how I have served the Lord without being proud. And I have even cried for you. I served the Lord when I had troubles and when the leaders of the Jews tried to catch me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">I have not feared to tell you everything that would help you. I have taught you in meetings and in your homes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">I have told both the Jews and the Greeks to stop doing wrong things. I have told them to believe in our Lord Jesus Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And now I feel in my spirit that I must go to Jerusalem. I do not know what will happen to me there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">But in every city the Holy Spirit tells me I will be put in prison. I will have much trouble.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">But none of these things trouble me. I do not try to save my life. All I want is to finish what I must do with joy. The work which the Lord Jesus gave me is to tell the good news that God is kind.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">I know that you all will never see me again. I have told you about Gods kingdom.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">So I tell you today that if any one is lost, it is not my fault.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">I have not feared to tell you all that God wants you to know.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">The Holy Spirit has made you leaders over his people. Watch yourselves. Like one who takes care of his sheep, so you must take care of the church people. They are the Lords people. He gave his blood for them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">I know this, that there are people as bad as wild animals. After I leave you, they will come to you. They will trouble Gods people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Also, some men will come from among you. They will teach things that are not true.  They want people to follow them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">So then, watch and remember this. For three years, through the night and in the day, I told every one of you to be careful. I even cried as I told you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">And now, my brothers, I give you to God. I leave with you his word which brings blessing. That word is able to make you strong. It will give you your share in the good things of God promised by him. He gives these good things to people who are pure and holy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">I did not want anyone to give me money or clothes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">You yourselves know that I worked with my own hands to pay for the things that I and my friends needed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">I have always shown you that you must work hard, as I have. You must help those who cannot work. By so doing you are remembering the words of the Lord Jesus. He said, "It makes you more happy to give something than to get something."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">When Paul had said this, he kneeled down and talked to God with them all.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">They all cried much. They put their arms around his neck and kissed him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">They were sad most of all because he had said they would not see him again. And they went with him to the boat.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="21">
      <VERS vnumber="1">When we had said goodbye to them, we left them. We went straight across the water to the island of Cos. The next day we came to the island of Rhodes. Then we went to the city of Patara.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">There we found a boat going to the country of Phoenicia, so we went there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">When we saw the island of Cyprus, we went on the right side of it to Syria. We landed at Tyre because they unloaded the boat there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">We found some Christians and stayed for seven days. The Holy Spirit spoke through them to Paul, Do not go on to Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">When the seven days had passed, we left and went on our way. All of the men, women,  and children went with us out of the city. There by the sea we kneeled down and talked to God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">We said goodbye to each other. Then we got on the boat and they went back to their homes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">From Tyre we went to Ptolemais. There we greeted the Christian brothers and stayed with them one day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">The next day we left and came to Caesarea. We went into the house of Philip. He was a man who went out telling the good news. He was one of the seven helpers in the church.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">He had four daughters who spoke words from God. They were not married.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">While we were staying there for some days, a prophet named Agabus came from Judea.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">When he came to us, he took Pauls belt. He tied his own hands and feet with it. Then he said, The Holy Spirit has told me that in the same way the leaders of the Jews in Jerusalem will tie the man who owns this belt. They will give him over to the people who are not Jews.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">When we heard this, both we and the people there talked to Paul and begged him not to go to Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Then Paul answered, Why are you crying and making me sad like this? I am ready to be tied and also to die at Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">So when we saw that he would not change his mind, we stopped begging him. We said,  May the Lord do what he wants to be done.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">After that, we took our things and went to Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Some of the Christians from Caesarea went with us. One of them was Mnason, a man born in Cyprus. He was one of the first Christian believers. We stayed in his house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">When we reached Jerusalem, the Christian brothers were glad to see us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">The next day Paul went with us to see James. All the church leaders were there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">First, Paul greeted them. Then he told them one by one the things God had done as he worked among the people who were not Jews.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">When they heard it, they praised the Lord. They said to Paul, Brother, there are many thousands of Jews who believe. They all say we must obey the law of Moses.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">They have heard that you teach all the Jews who live in other lands. They heard that you tell them not to obey Moses law: that they need not circumcise their children like the Jews do; and they can leave the Jewish ways of living.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">What should we do about it? Many people will gather together because they will surely hear that you have come.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Now then, do the thing we tell you. We have four men who have made a promise.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Take them with you. Make yourself clean with them, the way the law says to do. Pay the cost for having their hair cut. Then all the people will know that all the things they heard about you are not true. They will know that you live the way the law says you should live.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">We sent a letter to those who are not Jews and have believed. Here is what we told them they must not do. They must not touch things that have been given to idols. They must not taste blood. They must not eat the meat of animals that were killed by choking. And they must not take part in any kind of wrong sexual behaviour between men and women.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Then Paul took the men with him. The next day he made himself clean with them the way the law says to do. Then he went into the temple. He told the priests which day they would finish making themselves clean. On that day a sacrifice would be made for each one of them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">The seven days were almost over. The Jewish leaders from Asia Minor saw Paul in the temple. They got all the people there excited. They caught hold of him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">They shouted, All you men of Israel, come and help us! This is the man who teaches everyone everywhere not to respect our people. He says we need not obey the law or respect this temple. And what is more, he has brought Greek people into the temple. He has made this holy place unclean.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">They said this because they had seen a man from Ephesus named Trophimus. He was in the city with Paul. And they thought that Paul had brought him into the temple.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">So all the people in the city were excited. They came running. They caught Paul and took him out of the temple by force. Then the doors were shut behind them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">They were trying to kill him. The officer in charge of the soldiers heard that all the people of Jerusalem were making trouble.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">Right away he took some soldiers and officers with him and ran down to the people.  When the people saw them they stopped beating Paul.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">Then the officer came up and took Paul. He had him tied with two chains. Then he asked who he was and what he had done.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Some of the crowd shouted one thing and some of them shouted something else. The captain could not find out what was true. The people were shouting too much. So he told his soldiers to take Paul into their army house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">When Paul came to the steps, the soldiers carried him because the people were fighting to get him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">They were all following, shouting, Kill him!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">Just as the soldiers were going to take Paul into their army house, he said to the officer,  May I tell you something? So, you speak the Greek language! said the officer. I thought you were the man from the country of Egypt who made trouble a while ago. I thought you were the one who led four thousand bad men into the desert.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">Paul said, I am a Jew. I was born in the city of Tarsus in Cilicia. I belong to a great city.  Please let me talk to these people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">So the officer let him talk. Paul stood on the steps and put up his hand. Then all the people were very quiet. He talked to them in the Jews language.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="22">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Paul said, Men, brothers, and fathers, listen while I tell you my side of this matter.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">When the people heard him speak in the Jews language, they were even more quiet.  Then Paul said, I am a Jew. I was born in the city of Tarsus in Cilicia. But I was raised here in this city. Gamaliel was my teacher. He taught me very well in the law of our fathers. I was trying hard to obey God, just as you all are today.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">I troubled very much the people who believed this Way. I even killed them. I had men and women tied and put into prison.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">The high priest and all the leaders know that this is true about me. They wrote letters for me to carry to the leaders of the Jews in the city of Damascus. I went to have the Christians there tied and brought to Jerusalem to be punished.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">I was on my way and was near Damascus. It was about midday. All at once a very bright light from the sky shone all around me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">I fell to the ground and heard someone say to me, "Saul, Saul, why are you troubling me?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">I said, "Who are you, Lord?" He answered, "I am Jesus of Nazareth. You are troubling me."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">The men who were with me saw the light. They were afraid. But they did not hear the one who spoke to me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Then I said, "Lord, what shall I do?" And the Lord said to me, "Get up and go to Damascus. There someone will tell you all you must do."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">I could not see because the light was so bright. My friends led me by the hand to Damascus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">A man named Ananias was there. He obeyed the law of Moses, and all the Jews who lived there spoke well of him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">He came to see me. He stood by my side and said to me, "Brother Saul, you can see again!" And right then I was able to see him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">He said, "The God of our fathers has chosen you to know his will. He chose you to see the One who is right and to hear him speak.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">You will speak for him. You will tell all the people what you have seen and heard.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Now, why do you wait? Get up and be baptised. Wash away your wrong ways by calling on the name of the Lord!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">After I went back to Jerusalem, I was talking to God in the temple one day. Something like a dream came over me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">I heard the Lord say to me, "Leave Jerusalem quickly, right away. The people will not listen to the things you say about me."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And I said, "Lord, they know that I put in prison those who believed in you. I beat them in all the meeting houses.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And I stood by and let people kill Stephen. He was one who talked for you. I looked after the clothes of the men who killed him."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">But the Lord said to me, "Go! I will send you far away to the people who are not Jews."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">The people listened to Paul until he said that. Then they shouted, Kill him and get him off the earth. A man like that should not live!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">The people shouted. They waved their clothes about and threw dust in the air.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">The man in charge of the soldiers ordered Paul to be brought into the army house. He said that he should be beaten hard to make him tell why the people shouted so much at him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">When they had tied him with ropes, Paul said to the captain who was standing by, Is it right for you to beat a man who belongs to Rome without judging his case?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">When the captain heard this, he told the commanding officer. He said, What are you going to do? This man is a Roman!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Then the commanding officer came to Paul and said, Tell me, are you a Roman? Yes, I am, replied Paul.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Then the officer said, I paid much money to become a Roman. Paul said, I was born a Roman.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Then the men who were going to beat him left him. The officer was afraid when he knew Paul was a Roman, because he had tied him up.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">The officer wanted to know the real reason why the Jewish leaders were angry with Paul. So the next day he had Paul untied. He called the chief priests and the leaders to hold a court meeting. Then he took Paul down and brought him in before them.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="23">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Paul looked at the members of the court and said, My brothers, I have done what I thought God wanted me to do, right up to this day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Ananias, the high priest, said to those who were standing near Paul, Hit his mouth!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Paul said, God will hit you down, you dirty wall painted white! You sit there to judge me by the law and you break the law by telling them to hit me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">The people who stood near Paul said, Do you say a wrong thing like that to Gods high priest?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Paul said, I did not know that he is a high priest. The holy writings say, "You shall not say anything wrong about a ruler of your people."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Paul knew that some of the men were from the Sadducee group and some of them were from the Pharisee group. So he called out in the court, My brothers, I am a Pharisee. My fathers were Pharisees. I am being judged because I believe that the dead will be raised to life again.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">When he had said that, the Pharisees and the Sadducees began to talk back and forth.  The men in the court were divided.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">The Sadducees say the dead will not be raised again. They say there is no angel or spirit.  But the Pharisees believe in all these three things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">There was much shouting. Some of the clever men who were Pharisees got up. They said, We do not think this man has done wrong. Perhaps some angel or spirit really did speak to him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">The people started fighting. The commanding officer was afraid they would tear Paul into pieces. So he told the soldiers to take Paul and bring him into the army house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">The next night the Lord stood beside Paul. He said, Be glad, Paul. You have told people about me in Jerusalem. You must also talk about me in Rome.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">In the morning, some of the Jewish leaders planned together. They made a promise that they would not eat or drink until they had killed Paul.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">There were more than forty Jews who made this secret plan together.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">They came to the chief priests and leaders and said, We have made a promise for ourselves. We will not eat anything until we have killed Paul.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">So now, you and the members of the court send word to the commanding officer. Tell him to bring Paul down to you. Make him think you want to find out more about Paul.  We will be ready to kill him before he gets there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">The son of Pauls sister heard about their secret plan. So he went into the army house and told Paul.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Paul called one of the officers and said to him, Take this young man to the commanding officer. He has something to tell him!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">So the officer took him to the commanding officer. He said, Paul, the prisoner, called me. He asked me to bring this young man to you because he has something to tell you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">The officer took the young man by the arm. He went to one side so they could be alone.  He asked, What do you want to tell me?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">The young man said, The leaders of the Jews have made a plan. They will ask you to bring Paul down to court tomorrow. They will say that they wish to find out more about him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">But you must not do this. More than forty Jews are waiting for him. They have made a promise to themselves. They will not eat or drink until they have killed him. They are ready now and waiting for your agreement.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">So the commanding officer sent the young man away. He said, You must not tell anyone that you have told me about these things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">The commanding officer called two officers to him. He said, Get two hundred soldiers ready by nine oclock tonight to go to Caesarea. Send seventy men with them who will ride on horses and two hundred men who will carry spears.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Also have horses ready for Paul to ride. Take him safely to Felix, the ruler.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">The officer wrote a letter to Felix like this:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Claudius Lysias sends greetings to you, great ruler Felix.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">This man was caught by the Jews. They were ready to kill him. But I came with my soldiers and took him away, because I found out that he is a Roman.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">I wanted to find out what complaint they had against him, so I brought him into their court.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">I found out that their complaints were to do with their law. But he had not done anything wrong enough to die or to be put into prison.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">When I heard that the Jewish leaders were planning to catch him, I sent him to you at once. I told those who are making complaints against him that they must bring the matter to you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">So the soldiers took Paul as they had been told to do. They went with him that night as far as the town of Antipatris.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">The next day the soldiers went back to the barracks. Only the men who were riding horses went with Paul.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">When they reached Caesarea, they gave the letter to the ruler and brought Paul to him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">He read the letter. Then he asked Paul what country he came from. He heard that Paul was from Cilicia. Then he said, I will hear all you have to say when the men who have made the complaint come here. He ordered Paul to be kept in the house which is called Herods palace.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="24">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Five days later, Ananias the high priest came from Jerusalem. He brought with him some of the leaders and a lawyer named Tertullus. They told the ruler their complaint against Paul.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Paul was called in. Tertullus began to bring the complaints. Great ruler Felix, he said,  we have peace because of what you have done. These people have a better life because of you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">We are always very glad for this everywhere we go.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">I do not want to take much of your time. But please be kind and listen to a few words from us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">We have found this man to be a real trouble-maker. He talks to the Jews all over the world and causes them to disobey the laws. He is the leading trouble-maker of the Nazarene group.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">He even tried to make the temple unclean. But we caught him and were going to judge him by our law.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">But Lysias the commanding officer came. He took Paul away from us by force.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">He told those who have complaints against him to come to you. Ask him yourself and you will find out from him about all these complaints we have brought against him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">The Jews agreed with what Tertullus the lawyer said. They said, Yes, yes, he is telling the truth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">The ruler made a sign for Paul to speak. So Paul said, I know that for many years you have judged matters for this people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">So I am happy to speak for myself. Not more than twelve days ago I went to Jerusalem to worship. If you ask the people, you will find this out.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">They did not find me quarrelling with anyone in the temple. I was not making trouble among the people in the meeting houses or in the city.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">They cannot prove the things they have said against me here.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">But I myself tell you this. I worship the God of my fathers in the Christian way. They say this is not the right way. I believe everything that the law teaches. I believe everything that the prophets have written.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">I believe that God will raise from death both the good people and the bad people. These people here believe the same thing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">I always try to do what is right to God and to men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">I was away for a few years and I had come to Jerusalem to bring gifts to my people, and to give offerings.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">While I was doing this, they found me in the temple. I had made myself clean the way the law says to do. I did not have many people around me. I was not making trouble.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Some Jews were there from Asia Minor. They should be here before you and talk against me if they have anything to say.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Or let these men here tell if they found anything wrong with me when I stood in their court.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">I did this one thing. I shouted while I was standing among them, "I am being judged today because I believe that the dead will be raised again."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Felix sent them away because he knew many things about the Christian way. He said,  When Lysias, the commanding officer, comes down, I will know everything about this matter.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">He said to the officer, Keep Paul in prison but let him have some freedom. Let his friends come to visit him and to do things for him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Some days after that, Felix came with his wife Drusilla. She was a Jewess. He sent for Paul and listened to what Paul said about believing in Christ Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Paul talked about what is right, about living the right way, and about the time when all people will be judged. Felix was very much afraid when he heard these things. He said to Paul, You may go now. When I have time, I will call you again.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">He hoped that Paul would give him money to free him. And so he often sent for Paul and talked with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">After two years, a man named Porcius Festus came to rule in Felixs place. Felix had wanted to please the Jewish leaders, so he left Paul in prison.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="25">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Three days after Festus came to the country, he went to Jerusalem from Caesarea.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Then the chief priests and the leaders of the Jews told him what they had against Paul.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Please do something for us, they begged. Send for Paul to come to Jerusalem. They had made a secret plan to kill him on the road.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Festus said, Paul is being kept in prison in Caesarea. I myself am going there soon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Let the men among you who are able come with me. If Paul has done anything wrong,  then they can talk against him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Festus stayed only eight or ten days more among them. Then he went to Caesarea. The next day he sat on his chair in the court and had Paul brought in.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">When Paul came in, the Jewish leaders who had come from Jerusalem stood around Paul. They talked much against him. But they could not prove that the things they said were true.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Paul spoke for himself. He said, I have done no wrong to the law, or to the temple, or against Caesar the ruler of the Romans.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Festus wanted to please the Jewish leaders, so he said to Paul, Will you go to Jerusalem and let me judge you there about these things?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Paul said, I am standing in Caesars court. That is where I should be judged. I have done nothing wrong to the Jews. You yourself know that well.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">If I have done wrong things, or any wrong thing for which I should die, then I do not ask to live. But if the things these people say are not true, then no one has power to give me up to the leaders of the Jews. I ask to go to Caesar.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">So Festus talked the matter over with the court. Then he said to Paul, You have asked to go to Caesar. All right, you will go to Caesar!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Some time after that, king Agrippa and Bernice came to Caesarea to greet Festus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">They stayed for many days. Festus brought Pauls matter to the king. He said, Felix left a man in prison here.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">When I was in Jerusalem, the chief priest and leaders of the Jews came to me. They talked against him, and they asked me to punish him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">I told them that the Romans do not do it that way. They do not punish a man until he has met those who talk against him. Then he has a chance to speak for himself.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">So they came here with me. I did not wait. The very next day I sat on my chair in the court and had the man brought in.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">When they stood up, they did not say the wrong things against him that I thought they would.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">But instead, they had a quarrel with him about the things they believe in. The quarrel is about a man named Jesus who died. Paul said he is alive.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">I did not know how to judge such things. So I asked if he would go to Jerusalem and be judged there about these matters.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">But Paul asked to wait and let Caesar judge his case. So I had him put in prison to be kept there until I can send him to Caesar.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Agrippa said to Festus, I should like to hear the man myself. Festus said, Tomorrow you shall hear him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">So the next day Agrippa and Bernice came, making a big show of themselves. They went into the room to hear Paul talk. Officers and the leading men of the city also went in.  When Festus called for Paul, he was brought in.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Then Festus said, King Agrippa and all you men here with us, you see this man. All the Jewish leaders, both in Jerusalem and here, came together and talked about him. They shouted, "He must die!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">But I found out that he had not done anything wrong for which he should die. He himself asked to go to Caesar, so I decided to send him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">But I have no real complaint about him to write to my ruler. So I have brought this man before you all, and most of all before you, king Agrippa. When you have heard him, I hope I will have something to write about him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">I think that it does not make sense to send a prisoner and not say what wrong he has done.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="26">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Then Agrippa said to Paul, You may speak for yourself. So Paul put out his hand and began to speak.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">King Agrippa, I am happy to speak for myself before you today. I will talk about all the things the leaders of the Jews have said against me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">You know all the ways of the Jews. You know what they believe. So please take time to listen to me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">All the Jews know the way I lived from the time I was young. From the beginning I lived with my own people at Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">They have known me for a long time. They know, if they would tell it, that I lived like the Pharisee group. They obey the law better than any others who worship God the way we do.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">I believe that God will keep the promise that he made to our fathers long ago. That is why I am standing here being judged today.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">All the people of our twelve tribes serve God faithfully day and night. They do this because they believe they will receive what he has promised. Because I believe this, king Agrippa, the Jewish leaders are talking against me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Why is it so hard for any of you to believe that God should raise the dead?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">I used to think that I must do many things against the name of Jesus of Nazareth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">I did this in Jerusalem. The chief priests gave me power. I put many of Gods people in prison. And when they were killed, I agreed to it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Often I punished them in all the meeting places. I tried to make them say wrong things about Christ. I was very, very angry. I even went to other cities to trouble them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And so I was on my way to the city of Damascus. The chief priests had given me power and a letter.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">I was on the road at midday, king Agrippa, and I saw a bright light. It came from the sky and was brighter than the light of the sun. It shone all around me and the men who were travelling with me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">We all fell to the ground. I heard someone say to me in the Jews language, "Saul, Saul,  why are you troubling me? You hurt yourself when you kick against the sticks which guide you."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">I said, "Who are you, Lord?" And the Lord said, "I am Jesus, the one you are troubling.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">But get up. Stand on your feet. Here is why I have shown myself to you. I have chosen you to work for me. I have chosen you to tell people what you saw when you saw me today. You are to tell them also about the other times when I will show myself to you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">I will keep you safe from your own people, the Jews. And I will keep you safe from those who are not Jews. I am sending you to them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">I send you to them to open their eyes. Then they will turn from darkness to light. You are to take them out of Satans power and turn them to God, to be forgiven of their wrong ways. Then they will be among those who are made clean and pure by believing in me."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">So, king Agrippa, I obeyed what the one from heaven told me to do.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">I told the good news to the people of Damascus and Jerusalem. Then I told it all over Judea. I went to those who are not Jews. I told everyone that they must stop doing wrong things and turn to God. I told them they must show by the way they live that they have stopped doing wrong things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">That is why the leaders of the Jews caught me in the temple and tried to kill me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">God has always helped me up to today. I have stood and talked to both small people and great people. I have said nothing more than what the prophets and Moses said would happen.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">They said Christ must suffer. They said he would be the first person to rise from death.  He would be the first person to bring news of light to the Jews and those who are not Jews.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">While Paul was saying these things Festus shouted, Paul, you are crazy! All your book learning is making you crazy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Paul said, No, great ruler Festus, I am not crazy. But what I say is true. It makes good sense.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">The king knows about these things. I am not afraid to talk to him about them. I am sure that not one of these things happened without his knowing about it. This did not happen in secret.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">King Agrippa do you believe the prophets? I know you believe them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Then Agrippa said to Paul, You are trying to make me a Christian right away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Right away or later, said Paul. I wish that all who hear me today might be what I am.  That is, what I am without these chains.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Then king Agrippa stood up. Festus and Bernice and those who were sitting there with them stood up also.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">They left the room and talked the matter over. They said, This man is not doing anything wrong for which he ought to be in prison or die.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">Agrippa said to Festus, We could let this man go free if he had not asked to go to Caesar.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="27">
      <VERS vnumber="1">It was planned that we would go by boat to Italy. An officer named Julius was put in charge of Paul and some other prisoners. Julius was an army captain in the Augustan group.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">We got on a boat which was from the city of Adramyttium. This boat was going along the coast of Asia Minor. And so we went out to sea. A man named Aristarchus from the city of Thessalonica in Macedonia came with us also.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">The next day we stopped at the city of Sidon. Julius was kind to Paul. He allowed him to go to see his friends so they could care for him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Then we started out to sea again. We went near the island of Cyprus, because the wind was blowing against us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">We crossed the sea by the countries of Cilicia and Pamphylia. Then we reached the city of Myra in Lycia.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">There the officer found a boat from the city of Alexandria going to the country of Italy.  So he put us on that boat.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">We went slowly for many days. And after much trouble, we reached the city of Cnidus.  The wind was blowing hard against us. We could not go on. So we went around the south side of the island of Crete, past Cape Salmone.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">We had trouble going along near the coast, but at last we came to a place called Fair Havens. This was near the town of Lasea.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">It was now so late in the year that it was a bad time to go by boat. So Paul spoke to them about it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">He said, Sirs, I see that if we go on by boat, we will have much trouble. Something bad will happen to the things on the boat and to the boat itself, and also to us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">The officer did not listen to what Paul said. But he listened to the captain and the owner of the boat.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">This place was not a good place for the boat to stay through the winter months of the year. So most of the men wanted to go on. They thought they might be able to reach Phoenicia and stay there for the winter. Phoenicia is a good place on the island of Crete.  Boats can stay there. The winds do not blow against them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">When the south wind began to blow a little, they thought they had what they wanted. So they started off. They went along very close to the land of Crete.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">But soon a very strong north-east wind blew from Crete.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">The wind blew against the boat and it could not go into the wind. So they let the boat go where the wind took it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">We came close to a small island called Clauda. There we had a hard time to pull up the small boat.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">However, at last they got it up. Then they put ropes around the boat to make it strong.  They were also afraid they would get stuck in a bad place in the sand. So they took down the big sail cloth that was up to catch the wind. Then they let the boat go where the wind took it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">The next day the storm was very bad. They threw out the things that were in the boat.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And the third day they threw off the things they used on the boat, with their own hands.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">For many days we could not see the sun or the stars. The bad storm kept on. We did not think that we would be saved.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">The men of the boat had not eaten anything for a long time. Then Paul stood up and said,  Sirs, you should have listened to me and not left Crete. But you did leave. So you have had much trouble and have lost all these things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Now I tell you to be glad. Not one of you will die. Only the boat will break and be lost.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">I belong to God and worship him. Last night his angel stood before me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">He said, "Paul, do not be afraid. You must stand before Caesar. And see, God has given you the lives of all these men who are travelling with you."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">So be glad, sirs. I believe God. It will be just the way he told me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">However, we will have to go on an island.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">On the fourteenth night we were being blown across the Adrian Sea. About midnight the boatmen thought that we must be near some land.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">So they tested how deep the water was there. They found that the line went down twenty arm lengths. A little later they tested and found that it was only fifteen arm lengths deep.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Then they were afraid that we would hit the rocks. There were four heavy iron hooks called anchors. They let them down into the water at the back end of the boat. Then they wished that morning would come.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">The boatmen wanted to get off and leave the boat. They even put down the small boat into the water. They said they were going to put more anchors out from the front of the big boat.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">But Paul said to the officer and soldiers, If these men do not stay on the boat, you cannot be saved.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">Then the soldiers cut the ropes holding the small boat and let the water carry it away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">When it was almost morning, Paul begged them all to eat. He said, Today is the fourteenth day that you have been watching and have not eaten anything.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">So now, I beg you, eat something. You need it to make you strong so you can save yourselves. Not one of you will lose even one hair from your head.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">When he had said this, he stood in front of them all. He took some bread and thanked God for it. Then he broke it and began to eat it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">Then they all were glad and ate some food themselves.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">In all, we were 276 people on the boat.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">They ate all they wanted. Then they threw the grain into the water, so that the boat would not be so heavy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">In the morning they saw land. But they did not know what country it was. They saw a sandy place. So they talked it over and thought they would try to get the boat on it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">They cut off the anchors and left them in the water. At the same time, they untied the wood that guided the boat. They put up the big sail to catch the wind and tried to get the boat onto that sandy place.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">But they came to a place where there was sand under the water. The boat stuck in it.  The front end stuck so badly that they could not make it go. The back end began to break up because the water beat it so hard.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">The soldiers wanted to kill the prisoners so that none of them would swim to land and run away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">But the officer wanted to save Paul, so he stopped the soldiers. He told the people,  Those of you who can swim, jump into the water first and get to the land.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">Then the rest of you jump in and go on planks and other pieces of the boat. So in this way they all got to the land safely.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="28">
      <VERS vnumber="1">When we were safe on land, we found that the island we were on was called Malta.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">The people there were very kind to us. They made a fire for us and took care of us. It was cold and raining.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Paul gathered some sticks of wood. He put them on the fire. A bad snake came out of the heat and hung onto his hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">The people of Malta saw the snake hanging on his hand. Oh, they said to each other.  This man has no doubt killed someone. He did not die in the water, but it is not right for him to live.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Paul shook the snake off into the fire. It did not hurt him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">The people thought surely he would swell up or would drop down dead at once. They waited a long time and saw that nothing bad happened to him. Then they said, We were wrong. He must be a god.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">The ruler of the island was a man named Publius. He owned some of the land there. He took us to his house for three days and was very kind to us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">The father of Publius was sick with fever, and blood was coming from his body. Paul went to see him. He talked to God and put his hands on the man. He healed him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">After this, other sick people on the island came to Paul. And they too were healed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">They gave us many things. When we went away, they put on the boat for us the things that we would need.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">A boat from the town of Alexandria was at the island all through the winter time. It was marked with a sign of the Twin Brothers. After we had been on the island for three months, we went on that boat.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Then we went to the city of Syracuse and stayed for three days.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">After that we turned the boat along the coast. We reached the town of Rhegium. When we had been there for a day, a south wind began to blow. On the second day we came to the city of Puteoli.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">There we found some Christian brothers. They asked us to stay with them for seven days. Then we went to Rome. Some of the Christians at Rome had heard about us. They came to places called the Market Place of Appius and the Three Hotels. There they met us. When Paul saw them, he thanked God. It made him strong and glad to see these brothers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">When we came to Rome, Paul was allowed to stay in a house by himself with the soldier who guarded him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">After three days, Paul called for the leaders of the Jews at Rome. When they had come,  he said to them, My brothers, I have done nothing against our people. I have obeyed the laws of our fathers. And yet I was made a prisoner at Jerusalem and was given over to the Romans.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">When the Romans judged my case in court, they wanted to let me go free. They said there was no reason to kill me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">But the Jewish leaders did not agree to let me go free, so I had to ask to be brought before Caesar. I did not have anything to say against my people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Now, here is why I have asked to see you and to talk to you. I am a prisoner tied with chains because I believe the same promise the Jews believe.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">They said to him, The people of Judea have not written us any letter about you. When our brother Jews have come here, not one of them has told or said anything wrong about you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">But we want to hear from you what you think. We know that people everywhere are talking against this Christian group.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">So they chose a certain day. On that day many of them came to the house where Paul was staying. He told them about Gods kingdom. He tried to make them understand about Jesus by the things that were written in the law of Moses and in the books of the prophets. He talked from morning until evening.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Some of the people were ready to believe what he said, but others did not believe.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">They did not agree among themselves. So they started to go away. But before they left,  Paul said one more thing. What the Holy Spirit said was right. He spoke to your fathers long ago through Isaiah, the prophet of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">He said, "Go to these people and say, You will hear but never understand. You will look but never see.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">The hearts of these people have become hard. They do not hear with their ears. They have shut their eyes. They do not want to see with their eyes. They do not want to hear with their ears. They do not want to understand with their hearts. If they did, they would turn back to me and I would forgive them."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Paul said, Therefore know this. The message that God will save them has been sent to those who were not Jews. They will listen to it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">When Paul had said these words, the Jewish leaders went away. They were talking amongst themselves about these things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Paul stayed in Rome for two whole years in a house he paid money to live in. He was glad to see all who came to him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">He told them about Gods kingdom and taught them about the Lord Jesus Christ. He did this freely without fear. No one stopped him.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">I am Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ. He called me to be an apostle and to tell Gods good news.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Through his prophets long ago God promised this good news to people, in the holy writings.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">The good news was about his Son. He is Jesus Christ our Lord. He was a man born in Davids family.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">He came alive from death. That showed he was Gods Son. He had Gods power. Gods Holy Spirit did all this.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">This same Jesus Christ was kind to me. And he made me an apostle. I am sent in his name so that people in all nations will obey him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">You are some of them. You were called to belong to Jesus Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">I send greetings to all the Christians who live in the city of Rome. God loves you and has called you to be his people. May God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ bless you. In their kindness may they give you peace.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">People in all the world have heard that you believe. I thank my God through Jesus Christ for all of you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">God knows that I always talk to him about you. I worship him in my heart while I tell the good news about his Son.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">I ask God that in some way now I may be able to visit you, if he wishes me to do it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">I want very much to see you. I want to give you some gift from the Holy Spirit to make you stronger.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">I mean to say that we will both be helped. I will be helped because you believe, and you will be helped because I believe.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">My brothers, I want you to know that I have often planned to come to you. But something has stopped me until now. I planned to come so that I might see good things happen among you. I have done this in the other nations which are not Jewish.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">This is something I must do for the Greek people and for all other people. I must do it for people who are wise and for people who are not wise.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">That is why I want so much to tell the good news to you people in the city of Rome also.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">I am not ashamed of the good news of Jesus Christ. The good news is the power God uses to save every one who believes. The good news was for the Jews first, but also for those who are not Jews.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">The good news shows how God puts a person right. God puts a person right when that person believes in his Son and keeps on believing. The holy writings say, A person who is put right because he believes, will live for ever.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">God is angry. He has shown it from heaven. He is angry because of all the bad and wrong things people do. These people hold back Gods truth by the wrong things they do.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">They know about God. God himself has shown them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">People cannot see that God has power which lasts for ever. They cannot see that he is really God. But ever since he made the world, he has clearly shown this by the things he made. So they cannot say, I did not know about God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Even though they knew he was God, they did not worship him as God. They did not thank him. Their thoughts were no good. Their foolish minds became dark.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">They said they were wise people, but they were foolish people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">They did not worship God who cannot die. But they worshipped things made to look like a man who does die. They worshipped things made to look like birds and animals and snakes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">So God left them to do the things their hearts wanted to do. They did the things that are not right to do with their bodies. They did not respect their own bodies.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">They would not believe what was true about God. They believed a lie. They worshipped and worked for something that was made by God. They did not worship God-God who made all things. He is the one to worship for ever. Amen. May it be so!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">That is why God left them to do the wrong things they wanted to do. Their women left the right way for women and did things that are wrong for women to do.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Their men also left the right way with women. They wanted to have sex with one another. They did wrong things with other men. Their own bodies were punished because of the wrong things they did.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">They did not want to know God. So he left them to their wrong thoughts and to do things that are not right.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">They were very bad. They did every kind of wrong thing. They were greedy. They hated people. They were very jealous. They killed many people. They fought. They fooled people. They told lies about people. They carried stories from one person to another.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">They said wrong things about people. They hated God. They did not respect people.  They were proud. They talked big. They even thought of new wrong things to do. They did not obey their parents.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">.They were foolish. They did not do what they said they would do. They did not love people. They were not kind.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Do you judge another people? You your-selves have done wrong things. So when you judge others, you judge yourselves, because you do the same things. You judge them and yet you do the same things.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">Man, you judge people who do such things and yet you do them yourself. Do you think that God will not judge you?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Or do you not respect him for being kind, very patient, and for waiting a long time? Do you not know that God is kind, and he wants to lead you away from doing wrong things?</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="12">All those who do not know the law &lt;FI&gt;of God given to Moses&lt;Fi&gt; and did what was wrong,  will die. But they will not be judged by the law. All those who know the law and did what was wrong will be judged by the law.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Then what does a Jew have that others do not have? Or what good is it if a person has been circumcised?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">It is much better in every way. First, Gods law was given to the Jews.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">But some Jews did not keep his law. Does that mean that God cannot be trusted?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">No, it does not mean that. God must be true, even if every man is not true. The holy writings say this about God: People will see that you are right in what you say. You will be without fault when you are judged.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">When we do wrong things, we show that God is right. What shall we say about that?  Does God do wrong when he punishes us? (I speak the way people would think about it.)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">No, he does not. If he did wrong, how could he judge the world?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Maybe I say what is not true. And that makes people praise God more because he is true.  Then why does God still judge me and say I have done wrong?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Some people say wrong things about us. They say that we say, Let us do wrong things so that good things will happen. People who say such things should be punished.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="19">We know that everything the law says, it says to the people who have the law. Then no one can say a word for themselves. All the people in the world will be brought to God to be judged.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">No one will be put right with God because he has tried to obey the law. The law only makes people know what they have done wrong.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">So now God has shown how people can be put right with him without the law. The law and the prophets said he would do it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">God puts people right with himself when they believe in Jesus Christ. He does this for all who believe. They are all alike.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">All have done wrong and all are far from being as good as God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">But God is kind and makes them right with himself. It is a gift. He does it because Christ Jesus paid the price to set them free.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">God gave him as a sacrifice. When people believe in him, his blood pays for the wrong things they have done. This shows that God is good and right. He was right when he forgave the wrong things that people did long ago.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">God also shows that he is right now. He does this when he makes right any person who believes in Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Then what have we to be proud of? Nothing at all. Why not? Does God put us right with himself because of anything we have done? No. He does it because we believe.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">We know that if a person believes in Christ, God makes him right again. It is not because that person has obeyed the law.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Is God the God of the Jews only? Is he not the God of other people also? Yes, he is.  There is only one God of all peoples.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">He will put right people who have been circumcised &lt;FI&gt;the Jews&lt;Fi&gt; because they believe. And he will also put right people who are not circumcised when they believe.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">So what shall we say about Abraham? He is the father of our family on earth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">If Abraham was put right with God, because of what he did, he has something to be proud of. But he has nothing to be proud of when he stands before God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">What do the holy writings say? It says, Abraham believed God. And God said that he was a good man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">When a person works, his pay is not a gift to him. His pay belongs to him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">But no person can work to put himself right with God. It is God alone who makes a bad person right. The one who believes in him-even a bad person is put right.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">David also says that God blesses a man. God calls him a good man but not because he has kept the law.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">David said, God blesses people who have been forgiven the wrong things they have done. God covers over the wrong things they have done.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">The Lord blesses people when he forgets the wrong things they have done.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Does God bless only people who have been circumcised? Or does he also bless those who are not? We say, because Abraham believed God, God called him a good man. His faith made him right with God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">When did God say that? Was it when Abraham was circumcised? Or was it before? It was not when he was circumcised: it was before.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Abraham was circumcised as a sign. It was a sign that he was a good man, because he believed when he was not yet circumcised. That makes him the father of all people who believe, even those who are not circumcised. God says they are good people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">That makes him also the father of those who are circumcised. I mean people who are circumcised and do as our father Abraham did. Even when he was not circumcised, he believed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">God promised Abraham and his family that the world would belong to them. God did not make the promise because Abraham obeyed the law. But he made the promise because Abraham believed him and was put right with God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">If the world will belong to people who obey the law, it is of no use to believe God. And the promise is no good.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Because of the law, God is angry. Where there is no law, no one breaks the law.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">That is why people must believe. Because God is kind, he makes the promise sure for all of Abrahams children. The promise is for those who have the law and also for those who believe as Abraham did. He is the father of us all.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">the holy writings say, I have made you the father of many nations. Abraham was made the father of many nations by God. He believed God. He believed that God could make dead people live. He believed God when he said that things were true even though they had not happened yet.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Abraham believed and hoped, though there was nothing to give him hope. He believed that he would become the father of many nations. God had told him this would happen.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">He did not stop believing when he thought about his own body. It was almost dead. He was about one hundred years old. He did not stop believing when he thought about Sarah, even though she had never given birth to any children.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">He did not stop believing Gods promise. He believed God very much. He did not praise God for his own faith, but for Gods promise.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">He was sure that God was able to do what he had promised to do.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">He was put right with God because he believed the promise.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">The holy writings do not say that for Abraham only.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">They say it for us too. God will say we are put right if we believe in him who raised Jesus our Lord from death.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">We are made good people and put right with God when we believe in Jesus Christ. So now we have peace with God because of what our Lord Jesus Christ did.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Because we believe, Christ has brought us to the place where God can do us good. We are in that place now. We are very happy because we have the hope that we shall see Gods greatness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And not only is that true, but we are very happy in our troubles, because we know that trouble makes us stronger.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">When we are strong to take trouble, we prove that we believe. When we prove that we believe, we have hope.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">We will not be disappointed by this hope. God has given us the Holy Spirit. And the Holy Spirit has put Gods love in our hearts.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">We could not help ourselves. So at the right time, Christ died to save us bad people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Almost no one would die to save even a good man. But perhaps someone would die to save a very good man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">God shows his love for us in this way: Christ died to save us while we were bad people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">The blood of Christ has now put us right with God. So even more, he will save us from Gods strong anger.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">When we were enemies, the death of his Son brought us back to God. Now that we are made right with God, it is the life of Jesus that will save us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Not only is that true, but it is through our Lord Jesus Christ that we can enjoy God. This is for all who have been brought back to God by him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">One man &lt;FI&gt;Adam&lt;Fi&gt; did a wrong thing. And the wrong thing he did made him die. So all men die because all have done wrong things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">People in the world were not right with God before he gave the law. But wrong things are not punished when there is no law.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Yet death ruled over people from Adams time to Moses time. It even ruled over the people who were not as wrong as Adam. Adam was like a person who would come later.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">But the free gift is not like the wrong thing. Many people died because one man did a wrong thing. This is sure. God was very kind and he gave a free gift. This gift was given to many people because one man, Jesus Christ, did a very kind thing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">The free gift is not like the wrong thing one man did. Because of that one man people were judged. And they were punished. Because many people did wrong things, God gave his free gift and many people were made right with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">One man did a wrong thing. And so death ruled over people because of that one man.  God has been kind to people and given them his free gift. That gift is to make people right with God. People who take that gift will live and rule because of one man, Jesus Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">One man did a wrong thing. And so all people were punished through him. But Christ did the right thing. And so all people can have the free gift of life through being put right with God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">One man did not obey. And so many people were bad people. One man obeyed. And so many people will be made right with God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">When the law came, it showed how wrong people really were. But when people were really bad, God was even more kind.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">The wrong things people did ruled over them, and they died. Now God has been very kind. He has made people right with him. So now Gods blessing will rule over them, and they will live for ever. Jesus Christ our Lord has done this for them.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">What shall we say then? Shall we keep on doing wrong things so that God will be more kind to us?</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="4">We were buried when he was buried because we were baptised into his death. Christ was raised from death by the wonderful power of the Father. So we also must live a new life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Have we shared with Christ and died as he died? Then we shall share with him by rising from death as he arose.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="7">
      <VERS vnumber="1">My brothers, I am saying this to you people who know the law. Do you not know that the law is master over a person only while he lives?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">A married woman belongs to her husband by law as long as he lives. But if her husband dies, she is free from the law that made her belong to her husband.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">So if she belongs to another man while her husband is living, she commits adultery. But if her husband dies, she is free from that law. Then if she belongs to another man, she does not commit adultery.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">In the same way my brothers, you died when Christ died. And you are free from the law.  Now you belong to another person. You belong to the one who has been raised from death. Because of that, we are able to do what God wants us to do.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">One time we lived in the way our bodies wanted to live. The law made us think about doing wrong things. And we did things that made us die.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But now we have been made free from the law. We died, and so we are no longer slaves to the one who was our master. Now we are slaves to God in our new life. This new life is ruled by the Spirit. We do not work for the old written law.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">So what shall we say? Shall we say that the law is bad? No! I would not have known what is wrong if there had been no law. The law says, Do not want to take other peoples things. That is how I know it is wrong to want another persons things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">My wrong ways used the law to make me want all kinds of things. When there is no law,  the thing within me that wants to do wrong is dead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Once I had no law, and I lived. But when the law came, that which wanted to do wrong things came to life, and I died.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">The same law which was meant to make a person live, made me die.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">My wrong ways used the law to fool me and kill me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">So the law is holy. And what the law says is holy and right and good.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">So did that good thing make me die? No. The wrong things I did made me die, because that good thing showed they were wrong. And the law shows that the wrong things are very, very bad.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">We know that the law came from the Holy Spirit. But I am a weak man. I have been sold like a slave to do wrong things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">I do not know why I do the things I do. I do not do what I want to do. But I do the things I hate.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And if I do what I do not want to do, I agree that the law is good.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">So now it is no longer I who do it, but my wrong ways in me.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="20">If I do the thing I do not want to do, it is no longer I who do it, but the wrong thing in me that does it.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="25">Thank God for Jesus Christ our Lord who will do it! So this is the way it is. In my mind I am a slave to do the law of God, but in my body I am a slave to do the law of wrong things.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="2">The Spirit gives life in Christ Jesus. And the law of the Spirit has set me free from the law of wrong things, and the law of death.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">God has done what the law could not do. The things people did made the law weak. God sent his own Son in a body of man. His body was like the bodies which others use to do wrong things. He sent him because people have done wrong things. And he judged the wrong things people have done in their bodies.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">He did this so that we might be good people as the law said we should be. We are good people if we live the way the Spirit wants us to live, not the way our bodies want to live.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Some people live the way their bodies want to live. They think only about the things their bodies want to do. Other people live the way the Spirit wants them to live. They think about the things the Spirit wants them to do.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">If you keep your mind on the things your bodies want to do, you will die. But if you keep your mind on the things the Spirit wants, you will live and have peace.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">People who think about the things of this life are Gods enemies. They do not obey Gods law. They cannot obey it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">People who do what their bodies want cannot please God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Does Gods Spirit live in you? If he does, then you are not living the way the body wants,  but you are living the way the Spirit wants. If anyone does not have Christs Spirit, he does not belong to Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">But if Christ is in you, your bodies are dead because of the wrong things you have done.  But your spirits live because you have been made right with God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">God raised Christ Jesus from death. Does Gods Spirit live in you? Then God will also give life to your bodies which die. He does this through his Spirit who lives in you.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="15">The Holy Spirit you have received does not make you a slave again so that you are afraid.  But the Spirit you have received makes you sons of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">So we say, Father! Father! The Spirit himself also, along with our own spirits, tells us that we are Gods children.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">If we are his children, God will give us the good things that children receive. He will give us these blessings along with Christ. He will give it to us if we suffer with Christ. If we suffer with Christ, we will also be made great with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">I think that the troubles we have in this life are nothing when we think of the great things that we shall have.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="22">We know that the whole world has been crying. It has had much pain until now.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And not the world only, but we ourselves also cry out. We have the first blessing God gives of his Spirit. But we cry out in our hearts. We are waiting for God to finish making us his sons. Then our bodies will be set free.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">That is what we hoped for when we were saved. When the thing hoped for is seen, there is no more hoping. When a person sees a thing, how can he hope for it?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">But if we hope for something we do not see, we keep on waiting for it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Also the Spirit helps us because we are weak. We do not know how we should talk to God. But the Spirit himself talks to God for us, while we cry and cannot say any words.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">God looks to see what is in peoples hearts. And he knows what the Spirit is going to do.  The Spirit talks to God for Gods people. And he asks for them what God wants them to have.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">We know that God works out everything for the good of those who love him. They are the people who are part of his plan.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">He knew all along that he would choose them. He chose them to be made like his Son.  Then his Son would be the first one of many brothers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">He chose them and he also called them. He called them to himself as if they had never been bad people. He made them right with himself and he also made them great in heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">So what shall we say about this? If God is on our side, who can be against us?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">He did not keep his own Son, but gave him up for us all. Because he has given him to us,  will he not also give us all other things?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">Who will say anything against Gods chosen people? For it is God himself who says they have been put right with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Who will say they are not right? Jesus Christ died. Yes, he was raised from death. He is at the right side of God. And he talks to God for us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">Who can take us away from Christs love? We may have trouble. We may have hard times. People may make us suffer because we believe. We may have no food to eat and no clothes to wear. We may be in danger. We may be killed with big knives. Can any of these things take us away from Christs love?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">The holy writings say, For your sake we are killed all day. We are like sheep ready to be killed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">But Christ loved us. He has helped us to win great victory in all these things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">I know this. Death, life, angels, rulers, things happening now, things that will happen,  high things, low things; nothing else in all the world can come between us and Gods love in Christ Jesus our Lord.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">They did not know the way God makes people right with him. They tried to make themselves good people. So they did not obey Gods way to become right with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Christ has made an end to the law as a way of getting right with God. Everyone who believes in him is put right with God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Moses wrote this: A man who obeys the law will live by it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But the holy writings also speak about those who are put right by believing: Do not say in your heart, "Who will go up into heaven?" (That means, Who will go up to heaven to bring Christ down?)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Do not say, "Who will go down into the hole that has no bottom?" (That means, Who will go down to bring Christ up from the dead people?)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">But what do the holy writings say? They say, The word is near you, in your mouth and in your heart. That means, the word to believe which we tell people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">If you say with your mouth that Jesus is Lord, and if you believe in your heart that God has raised Christ from death, you will be saved.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">A person believes with his heart, and he is made right with God. He speaks with his mouth and so is saved from his wrong ways.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="16">But they have not all obeyed the good news. It is as Isaiah said it would be, Lord, who has believed what we have told them?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">So people believe because they hear. They hear because people tell them about Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">But I ask, have they not heard? Yes, they have. The holy writings say, Their voice has gone out all over the earth. And their words have gone out all over the world.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">But I ask, did not the Jews know? First the book of Moses says, I will make you jealous through people who are not a nation like the Jews. I will make you angry through people who do not even know or understand these things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">But the book of Isaiah says even stronger words. The people who did not look for me have found me. I have shown myself to those who did not ask for me.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="4">But what did God answer him? He said, I have seven thousand men who have not kneeled down to the idol god Baal.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">So now some are left because God was kind to them, and chose them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But if it was a gift because he was kind to them, then it was no longer because of the things they did. Or else a gift would no longer be a gift.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">So what does that mean? The Jews did not get what they tried to get. Only the people God chose got it. The hearts of the rest of the people became hard.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">The holy writings say, God made them dull with sleep. He gave them eyes that could not see, and ears that could not hear. They have been like that until today.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="11">So I ask, Have their feet been caught so that they have really fallen down? No. But because they began to fall, the people who are not Jews were told how to be saved. That would make the Jews jealous.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">The people who are not Jews have been richly blessed because the Jews failed. So it will be even better for them when the Jews no longer fail God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Now I say this to you who are not Jews. I am an apostle to those who are not Jews, so I think highly of the work I have been sent to do.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="19">Then you will say, The branches were broken off so that I might be joined to the tree.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">That is true. They were broken off because they did not believe. And you have your place only because you believe. So do not be proud, but fear.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">If God punished the trees own branches, he will punish you also.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">See how kind God is. And see how hard he is. He is hard on those who have fallen. But God is kind to you if you go on following in his ways. If you do not, you also will be broken off.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">God will also put back the other branches if they believe. God is able to put the Jews back where they belong.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">You were cut off from a wild olive tree. And you were put on a good olive tree. That is not the way trees grow. But it can be done. And so, even more, the Jewish branches will be put back on their own olive tree.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">My brothers, I want you to know something that has been a secret. Then you will not be proud of yourselves. The secret is this. Some Jews will have hard hearts until the right number of other people have come in.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="12">The night is almost past. Morning is near. Let us stop doing the wrong things people do in the dark. Let us do the good things that people do in the light.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Let us live in the right way like people who are in the light. We must not take part in noisy feasting with dancing, or get drunk. We must not do any kind of wrong thing with sex. We must not quarrel or be jealous.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Be ready to take a person into the church even if he does not know and believe all you believe. Do not judge what he thinks about things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">One person believes he may eat anything. Another person, who does not believe that,  eats only things that grow in the garden.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">The one who eats anything must not despise the one who does not eat everything. And the one who does not eat must not judge the person who does. God has accepted him as he is.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Why do you judge another persons servant? He stands or he falls before his own master.  But he will stand because the Lord can give him power to stand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">One man thinks, This day is better than that day. But another man thinks, All days are alike. Every man should be sure in his own mind what he believes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">One man honours the day to honour the Lord; another man does not honour the day to honour the Lord. The person who eats everything, eats it because he honours the Lord.  And he thanks God. And the person who will not eat every kind of food also does so to honour the Lord. And he still gives thanks to God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Not one of us lives for himself. And not one of us dies for himself.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">If we live, we live for the Lord. And if we die, we die for the Lord. So then, if we live or if we die we belong to the Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Christ wanted to be Lord, both of dead people and of living people. That is why he died and lived again.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Why do you judge your brother? Or why do you despise your brother? We shall all stand before God to be judged.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">The holy writings say, The Lord says, "As sure as I live, every knee will bow to me.  Every tongue will praise God."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">So each of us will tell God about what he has done.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">So we must not judge each other any longer. But it is better for us to judge this. Never put anything in a brothers way that will hurt him or that will make him fall down.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">As a Christian, I know and believe that nothing in itself is not right to eat. But it is not right for anyone to eat who thinks it is not right to eat.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Does what you eat trouble your brother? If it does, you are no longer living in love. Do not destroy the faith of someone because of what you eat. Christ died for him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">What is good for you must not be something that other people say is wrong.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">The kingdom of God is not about what a person eats and drinks. But it is about living in a way which is right with God. It is peace. It is joy because a person has the Holy Spirit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">A person who does the work of Christ in this way pleases God. And people like him.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="22">Keep to yourself and God what you believe about these things. God blesses a man who does not feel he has done wrong when he did what he thought was right.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">But a man who is not sure that he should eat something, does wrong if he eats it. That is because he does not believe the thing he is doing is right to do. And it is wrong to do what you do not believe is right.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="7">So, accept one another, as Christ has accepted you. Then people will know that God is great.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">What I say is this. Christ came to serve the Jews. He did this to prove that what God said was true. He proved that God kept his promises to the fathers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">He did this so that people who are not Jews would praise God because he is kind. The holy writings say, So I will praise you among the people who are not Jews. I will sing songs to your name.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">The holy writings also say, People who are not Jews, be glad with those who are Gods people.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="17">So, because of Christ Jesus, I am proud of my work for God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">I will speak only of what Christ has done through me. People who are not Jews have obeyed the good news. They have obeyed because of what I told them and because of what I did.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">I had the power to do signs and wonderful things through the power of the Holy Spirit. So I have told the good news of Christ all the way from the city of Jerusalem to the country of Illyricum.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">I have wanted to tell the good news where people have not heard the name of Christ. I did not want to work where another man had started to work.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">The holy writings say, They were not told about him, but they will see him. And the people who have not heard of him will understand.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="26">The people of Macedonia and Achaia wanted to send a gift to help Gods people in Jerusalem who are poor.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">They wanted to do it, and they should do it for them. The Jews gave the people who were not Jews the good things their spirits need. So the people who were not Jews should give the Jews the good things their bodies need.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">I will finish doing this, and I will give them what the people send them. Then I will go by you on my way to Spain.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="10">My Christian brothers, I beg you all in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, agree in what you say. Do not divide into groups. You should all think in the same way and decide to do the same things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">My brothers, I say this because I have been told by some of Chloes family that you are quarrelling.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">This is what I mean. Some of you say, I belong to Paul. Others say, I belong to Apollos. And others say, I belong to Cephas.And yet others say, I belong to Christ.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="14">I thank God that I did not baptize any of you but Crispus and Gaius.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="17">Christ did not send me to baptize people, but he sent me to tell the good news. I must not tell it with the clever words of this world. That would not show what the death of Christ on a cross truly means.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">When people who are turning away from God hear about the cross, they say, That is foolish! But for us who are being saved, the cross is the power God uses to save us.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="26">My brothers, remember what you were when God chose you. Not many of you were wise by the way people look at it. Not many of you had power. Not many of you came from a family with a big name.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">But God chose things that look foolish to the people of the world. He has used those foolish things to put the wise people to shame. God chose the weak things to put to shame the strong people.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="4">My words and my message were not in wise words to win you. But the power of the Spirit of God proved my words to be true.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="14">The person who does not have the Spirit does not receive the blessings of the Spirit of God. He thinks they are foolish. He cannot understand them because only people who have the Spirit of God can test them.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">You wrote me a letter. Here is my answer to the things in the letter. It is good if a man has nothing to do with a woman.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">But wrong sex is always a danger to us. So it is better for each man to have his own wife and each woman to have her own husband.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">The husband should give his wife what is right. So also, the wife should give her husband what is right.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">The wife does not have full right over her own body. But her husband has a right to it. In the same way, the husband does not have full right over his own body. But his wife has a right to it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Do not keep from the other what is right for them to have. It is all right to stay from each other for a while, if you both agree to it. Then you will have time for prayer. Afterwards,  come together again. If you do not, Satan might tempt you to do wrong.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">I say you may do this. I do not say that you must do it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">I wish that all men were like I am. But God has made everyone different. One man can live one way and another man can live another way.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Here is what I say to those who are not married and to those whose husbands are dead.  It is good for them to stay the way I am.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">But if they cannot keep themselves under control, then they should marry. It is better to marry than to burn with desire for sex.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And here is what I say to those who are married. (And yet it is not what I say. It is what the Lord has said.) The wife may not leave her husband.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">But if she does leave him, she must not marry again, or she must come back to her husband again. And the husband may not send away his wife.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Here is what I say to other people. (This is my word, not the Lords.) Perhaps a Christian brother has a wife who is not a Christian. If she wants to stay with him, then he should not send her away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Perhaps a woman has a husband who is not a Christian. If he wants to stay with her, then the woman should not leave him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">The husband who is not a Christian is made holy by the wife. And the wife who is not a Christian is made holy by the husband. If this were not so, then your children would not be holy. But they are holy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">If the one who is not a Christian really wants to leave, let him go. The Christian husband or wife is free then. God has called us to live in peace.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Wife, you do not know. Perhaps you will win your husband to the Lord. Husband, you do not know. Perhaps you will win your wife to the Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Only let me say this. Every man should go on living in the way which the Lord chooses for him. He should go on as he was when God called him to be a Christian. I say this to people in all the churches.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">If a man was already circumcised when God called him, he should not try to change the marks of it. If a man was not circumcised when God called him, he should not be circumcised.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">It does not matter whether one is circumcised or not. The thing that matters is doing what God says we must do.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Everyone should stay the way he was when God called him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">If you were a slave when God called you, do not let that trouble you. But if there is some way for you to get free, then do so.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">If a man was a slave when the Lord called him, he is the Lords free man. So also if a man was free when he was called, he is Christs slave.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">You were bought and paid for. Do not become slaves of men!</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="25">Here is what I say about those who are not married. (I have no law from the Lord about this. But here is what I think. You can trust me because the Lord has helped me.)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">I think that, since there is now trouble in the world, it is good for each one to stay as he is.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">If you have married a wife, do not try to be free from her. If you have no wife, do not look for one.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">But, if you marry, it is not wrong. And if a woman marries, it is not wrong. People who marry will have trouble in this life. And I want to keep you out of it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Here, my brothers, is what I mean. The time is short. In the time that is left, men who have wives should live as though they did not.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">People who cry should live as though they were not sad. People who laugh should live as though they were not glad. People who buy things should live as though they did not own them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">And people who are busy with things in this world should not be too busy. The world as we see it is passing away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">I want your minds to be free. The man who is not married thinks about the things of the Lord. He tries to please the Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">But the man who is married thinks about the things of this world. He tries to please his wife.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">In the same way, there is a difference between the woman who is married and the one who is not. The woman who is not married thinks about the things of the Lord. She wants her body and her spirit to be holy. But the married woman thinks about the things of this life. She tries to please her husband.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">I say this to help you, not to make it hard for you. I want to show you what is good. I do not want anything to stop you from serving the Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">And if a man feels that he is doing the right thing for the woman he is to marry, then let him marry her. That is, if she is no longer young, and if he wants her very much. Then he must do as he thinks best. It is not wrong for him to do it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">But the man who has made up his mind not to marry his woman will do well. That is, if he does not have to marry her, and is able to control himself, and if he is sure about it in his own mind.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">So the man who marries his woman will do what is good. But the man who does not marry her will do better.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">A wife may not leave her husband as long as he is living. But if he dies, she is free to marry any man she wants. Only this, he must be a Christian.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">But I think that she is happier if she stays as she is and does not marry again. (I think too that I am saying what the Spirit of God wants me to say in this matter.)</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">But if anyone loves God, then God knows him.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="6">Yet for us there is only one God. He is the Father. All things come from him. He is the one for whom we live. And there is only one Lord. He is Jesus Christ. He made all things.  He is the one who gives us life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">But not every Christian knows these things. Some of them have always believed in idols.  And when they eat food which has been given to an idol, they think the food belongs to the idol. And because they are weak Christians they feel they do wrong when they eat it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">One thing is sure, food will not bring us closer to God. If we eat it, it will not make us right with God. And if we do not eat, it will not make us wrong.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Perhaps you feel it is all right for you to do it. But be careful! It might make the weak Christian do wrong.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">You know it is not wrong for you to eat these things. But if a weak Christian sees you eating in the idols house, he will also want to eat food that has been given to an idol. He will do what is against his own belief.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">You know the truth, and yet your knowledge will make your weak brother do wrong.  You have hurt the faith of a brother, for whom Christ died.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">In this way you do wrong to your brother. You hurt him because he is weak. And in so doing you do wrong to Christ.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="11">We have planted seed by teaching you the good things of the Spirit. So we should receive something from you to help us to pay for our living.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">If it is right for other teachers to receive something from you, then we have more of a right to receive it. But we did not use our right. Instead, we do anything we can so that we will not stop the good news of Christ from going out.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="11">But the Lord did not make woman without man, and he did not make man without woman.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">As woman comes from man, so man is born by woman. And everything comes from God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">What do you think? Does it look right for a woman to talk to God in public with her head not covered?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">It would be a shame for a man to have long hair. Everyone knows this.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">But long hair is something for the woman to be proud of. Her hair has been given to her for a covering.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Does anyone still want to quarrel about this matter? This is what we do. And this is what the churches of God do also.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">In the next thing I have to talk about, I cannot say that you are doing well. Your meeting together is more bad than good.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">First, I hear that in the church meeting you divide yourselves into groups. I think this may be true.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">You also have groups of people who do not think the same way. Because of them you will soon learn which people please God the most.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">When you meet together, it is not the Lords supper that you eat.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">People take their own food and eat it without waiting. One gets nothing to eat. Another person drinks too much.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Do you not have your own homes where you can eat and drink? Do you have no respect for the church of God? Do you want to make poor people ashamed? What shall I say to you? Shall I say you are doing well? No, you are not doing well in this matter!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">The Lord gave me what I taught you. This is what it was. On the night when the Lord Jesus was sold to his enemies, he took bread.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">He thanked God for it. Then he broke it and said, Take this bread and eat it. This is my body which is broken for you. Do this so that you will remember me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">In the same way, after they had eaten, he took the cup. He said, This cup is the new agreement made by my blood. Every time you drink from this cup, do it to remember me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Every time you eat this bread and drink from this cup you tell about the Lords death,  until he comes again.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">So then, when anyone eats the bread and drinks from the cup in a way that is not right,  he has done wrong to the body and blood of the Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Each one must look into his own heart carefully. When he has done that, he may eat the bread and drink from the cup.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">The person who eats and drinks in a wrong way will be punished. He does not take it as the Lords body.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">That is why many of you are weak and sick. Many have died.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">But if we took time to look into our hearts first, then we would not be punished.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">When we are punished, the Lord is teaching us to do right, so that we will not be punished with the rest of the people of the world.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">So, my Christian brothers, when you come together to eat the Lords supper, wait on your turn.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">If a man is hungry, he should eat at home. Then when you meet, you will not be found in the wrong. There are other matters. I will talk about them when I come to see you.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Now, my Christian brothers, I want you to know something about the gifts given by the Holy Spirit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">You know that before you believed in God, you were led by other men to believe in idols that could not talk.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Therefore, I want you to understand this. No person who has the Spirit of God ever curses Jesus. And no one can say, Jesus is Lord, if he is not controlled by the Holy Spirit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">There are different gifts, but there is only one Spirit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">There are different kinds of work, but there is only one Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">There are different ways of working, but there is only one God. He works in all people and does it all.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And the Holy Spirit gives each one a gift so that all people may be helped.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">The Spirit gives one person wise words to say. The same Spirit gives another person words of good understanding.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">To another person the same Spirit gives faith, and to another person he gives the power to heal people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">To another person the Spirit gives the power to do big works. Another can speak words from God. To another person he gives the power to know the difference between spirits.  To another person he gives the gift to speak the words of God in other tongues or languages, and to another the meaning of these different tongues.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And the same Spirit gives the power for all these things. He gives each person what he wants to give to them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">A person has only one body, and the body has many parts. It is the same with Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">The one Spirit baptized us all to make one body. It made no difference whether we were Jews or Greeks, whether we were slaves or free men. We were all given to drink of one Spirit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">I say again, the body is not all one part, but has many parts.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Perhaps the foot says, I am not the hand, so I do not belong to the body. But it is still a part of the body.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Perhaps the ear says, I am not the eye, so I do not belong to the body. But it is still a part of the body.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">If all of the body were an eye, how could we hear? If all the body were an ear, how could we smell?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">The way it is now, God has put each part in the body in the place he wanted it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">If they were all one part, how could it be a body?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">The way it is now, there are many parts, but it is one body.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">The eye cannot say to the hand, I do not need you. And the head cannot say to the feet,  I do not need you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">No, that is not so. Some parts of the body are not as strong as others. Yet we could not live without them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And we look after some parts of our body more than others because they need it. The parts of our body that are not so fine in one way are made more fine in other ways. But the parts which are fine already do not need to be made fine. God made the body and has given more care to the parts that need it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">He did this so that the body would not be divided into groups, but all the parts would help each other. 26)If one part has trouble, then all the other parts are troubled too. If one part is praised, then all the other parts are glad with it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Now, all of you together are the body of Christ, and each one of you is a part of it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">God has given each person their right place in the church. First, there are the apostles.  Second, there are prophets who speak words from God. Third, there are those who teach. Then there are those who do big works. Then there are those who have the gifts to heal people, those who help in the work of the church people, those who lead and guide others, and those who speak Gods words in different kinds of tongues or languages.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Are all the people apostles? Can they all speak words from God? Can they all teach? Can they all do big works?</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="2">The person who talks in tongues of a different language does not talk to people, but to God. People do not understand what he says. But he is saying secret things by the Spirit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">But the person who is a prophet speaks words from God to people plainly. He helps them to believe and to be strong, and he comforts them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">The person who talks in a different tongue helps himself. But the one who tells forth Gods word helps all the people in the church.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">I wish that you could all talk in different tongues. But I want even more that you should speak words from God for all to hear and understand. The person who speaks words from God is greater than the person who talks in tongues-unless he is able to tell the meaning of his words, so that he helps all the people in the church.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">My brothers, if I come to you and talk in tongues of a different language, how can I help you? I cannot help you if I do not tell you something God has shown to me, or something I know, or Gods word, or some teaching.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Such things as horns or harps have no life, but they make sounds. Now if they dont make the right noise, no one will know what the sound means.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">If the war drum gives a sound that has no meaning, then no one will get ready to fight.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">If you say words that people cannot understand, they will not know what you say. You talk for nothing!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">There are no doubt many different languages in the world. And every one of them has a meaning.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="13">So then, the person who talks in a tongue of a different language, should ask God to help tell the meaning of the tongue.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">If I pray to God in a tongue of a different language, then I am talking with my spirit, but I do not use my mind.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">What then shall I do? I will talk to God with my spirit and I will talk to God with my mind.  I will sing with my spirit and I will sing with my mind.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="18">I thank God that I can talk in tongues more than any of you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">But in the church meeting it is better for me to say five words with my mind, so that I will teach other people also. This is better than to say ten thousand words in a tongue of a different language.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="22">So then, tongues are a sign to people who do not believe God. They are not a sign to those who believe him. But speaking words from God like a prophet is a sign to those who believe. It is not a sign to those who do not believe.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="27">If any people talk in a tongue, only two or not more than three should talk. They must talk one at a time and someone must tell the meaning.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">I told you first what was told to me. I told you that Christ died for the wrong things we did, as the holy writings said.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">He was buried. He was raised on the third day, as the holy writings said.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Peter saw him, and then all the twelve disciples saw him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">After that, more than five hundred Christian brothers saw him at one time. Most of them are still living, but some have died.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">After that, James saw him. Then all the apostles saw him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Last of all, I saw him too. I was like one who was born at the wrong time.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">The other apostles are all greater than I am. I should not be called an apostle because I troubled the people of Gods church.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">But God has been kind to me. He has made me what I am today. And he did not bless me for nothing. I did more work than any of them. Yet it was not I, but the loving kindness of God was working with me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">So it does not matter who gave the message, they or I. This is the message we gave, and this is the message you believed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">You have been told that Christ was raised from death. How can some of you say that dead people do not rise again?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">If dead people do not rise, Christ did not rise.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And if Christ did not rise, then what we told you was not true, and what you believe is not true.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">If this were so, we would have been telling lies about God, because we said that God raised up Christ. He did not raise up Christ if dead people are not raised up.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">If dead people are not raised, then Christ was not raised either.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">If Christ was not raised, then what you believe is no good. Your wrong ways have not been forgiven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">If that were true, then the people who believed in Christ who have now died, are lost.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And if we have hope in Christ for our life in this world only, then we are the most unhappy of all people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">But Christ really has been raised from death. He was the first one to rise of all who have died.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">It was a man who first brought death. So it was also a man who was first raised from death.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">All people who are of Adam die. And so also, all people who belong to Christ will live.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">But each one has his turn. Christ rose first. Then those who belong to Christ will rise when he comes again.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">After that the end will come. Christ will hand over the ruling power to God the Father.  Christ will stop all other rulers, and everyone who has any rights and power.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Christ must rule until God has all power over all his enemies.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Death is the last enemy to be destroyed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">The holy writings say, God has put all things under Christ. But it does not mean that God is under Christ. God is the one who put all things under him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">One day the Son will be over all things. And God will be over the Son. So in the end God will be over all things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Another thing, what good is it for people to be baptized for dead people? If dead people are not raised, why are some people baptized for them?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And why are we in trouble all the time?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">I face death every day! That is true. Just the way it is true that I am proud of you, my brothers. I am proud that you belong to Christ Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">I fought against wild animals at Ephesus. If I was thinking only of life on earth, why did I do this? If dead people do not rise, then we might just as well say, Let us eat and drink because we will die tomorrow.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">Do not be fooled. If good people keep company with bad people, the good people will become bad too.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Wake up! Do what is right. Stop doing wrong things. Some of you do not know God at all. I say these things to you to make you ashamed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">But someone will ask, How can dead people be raised? What kind of body will they have when they come back from death?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">What foolish questions! The seed you put in the ground must die before it can come to life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">You do not put a grown-up plant in the ground. You put in a seed, such as corn, wheat,  rice, or something like that.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">God gives the seed the body he wants it to have. He gives a different kind of body to every kind of seed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">Not all living bodies are alike. People have one kind of body. Animals have another kind of body. Fish another kind of body. Birds have another kind.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">So too, there are bodies for the sky and bodies for the earth. The bodies for the sky are fine in one way, and the bodies for the earth are fine in another way. They are not alike.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">The sun is fine in one way. The moon is fine in another way. The stars are fine in still another way. And one star is fine in a different way from another star.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">So it is with the body that is raised from death. When it is put in the ground it is a body that dies. When it rises from death, it will never die again.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">When it is put in the ground, it is not fine. When it rises, it is very fine. When it is put in the ground it has no strength. When it rises it is strong.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">When it is put in the ground it is only a body for this world. When it rises it is a body for the spirit. If there is a body for this world, then there is also a body for the spirit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">The holy writings say, The first man, Adam, was of this world! The last Adam &lt;FI&gt;Christ&lt;Fi&gt; is a Spirit who gives life.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="50">Now I tell you, my brothers, our bodies of flesh and blood can have no place in the kingdom where God rules. A body which will die can have no room in the kingdom of God where people will never die. 51,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="51">Listen! I tell you a secret. We will not all die, but we will all be changed. It will happen very quickly, as fast as one can shut his eyes. It will be when the trumpet or horn is blown the last time. Someone will blow the trumpet, dead people will rise, and they will never die again. We ourselves will be changed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="52">This body which dies must become a body which will never die.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="53">When this body which dies becomes one which will never die, what the holy writings say comes true. It says, Death is overcome by victory.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="7">Everyone should give what he wants in his heart to give. He should be glad to give it, and should not give it because he was forced to give. God loves a person who gives gladly.</VERS>

I have had hard times among those who should have been my brothers and were not.</VERS>

This is why: I do not want anyone to think I am better than what he sees I am, or hears me teach. I want him to judge me only by what he can see in me and by what I say.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Because the things God showed me were so wonderful, I might have become too proud of myself. But something happened and stopped that. It was like a thorn in me. It came from Satan &lt;FI&gt;the devil&lt;Fi&gt; to trouble me. It came to stop me from being too proud.</VERS>

When I am weak, that is the time I am really strong, have been acting like one with no sense, but you have made me do it. You should have been talking about the good things I have done.

      <VERS vnumber="3">Titus was with me. He was not a Jew, but they did not force him to be circumcised &lt;FI&gt;have the mark of a Jew made on his body&lt;Fi&gt; .</VERS>

They did not want us to be free the way Christ Jesus has made us free. But they wanted to make us obey the old laws again &lt;FI&gt;which were given to Moses by God&lt;Fi&gt; .</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="7">No, the leaders saw that God called me to take the good news to those who are not circumcised &lt;FI&gt;not Jews&lt;Fi&gt; , just as he called Peter to take the good news to those who are circumcised &lt;FI&gt;Jews&lt;Fi&gt; .</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">The same God who made Peter an apostle to the Jews made me an apostle to those who are not Jews.</VERS>

So they accepted Barnabas and me as fellow workers. They agreed that we should go to the people who were not Jews and they themselves would go to the Jews.</VERS>

But you live the way people do who are not Jews. How then can you force those who are not Jews to live the way the Jews do?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">We ourselves were born Jews. We are not of those who still follow wrong ways, those who are not Jews.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Yet we know that God does not call a man good because he tries to obey the law of the Jews. But we know that God puts a man right because he believes in Jesus Christ. So we also believed in Jesus Christ. And we are put right with God because we believe in Christ and not because we obey the law. No person will ever be called good by God just because he tries to obey the law of the Jews.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">We came to Christ to be put right with God. That showed us how much we had been bad men. Was it Christ who made us bad men? No, surely not!</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="19">Through the law I died. Now the law has no power over me so that I may live for God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">I died when Christ died on a cross. I do not live now, but Christ lives in me. Now while I still live in my body, I live by believing in the Son of God. He loved me and gave himself for me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">So I do not make the love of God useless. But if a person can be made good by the law,  then Christ died for nothing.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="3">
      <VERS vnumber="1">O you Galatians, have you no sense at all? Who has fooled you? You knew, just as if you had seen him with your own eyes, that Jesus Christ was killed on a cross.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Here is one thing I want to ask you. You received the Holy Spirit. Was that because you obeyed the law &lt;FI&gt;given to the Jews by Moses&lt;Fi&gt; ? No, it was because you heard Gods word and believed it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Have you no sense at all? You began living your new life by the power of the Spirit. And are you now trying to finish living it by your own power &lt;FI&gt;to keep the law&lt;Fi&gt; ?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">So many things happened to you. Was it all for nothing? Surely it was not for nothing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">God gives you the Spirit. He does wonderful works among you. Does he do this because you obey the law? No, he does it because you heard the word of God and believed it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">So it was with Abraham. The holy writings say He believed God, and that was why God called him a good man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">You see then, the people who believe God are children of Abraham.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">The holy writings say that he will put people right with himself if they believe him, even those who are not Jews. It was written down before God did it. The holy writings told the good news to Abraham ahead of time. It said, God will make you a blessing to all nations and people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Abraham believed God and was blessed. And so those who believe God are blessed too,  along with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">A curse is on all people who are trying to become good by obeying the law. The holy writings say, Everyone is cursed who does not always obey everything that is written in the book of the law and do it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Now, you can see this. No man is called a good man by God because he obeys the law.  The holy writings say, Those who are right with God shall live by faith.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">The law does not ask people to believe. It says, He who obeys the laws will live because of them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Christ has saved us from the curse which the law put on us. He took the curse on himself.  It should have been on us. The holy writings say, A curse be on everyone who hangs on a tree!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Christ Jesus did this so that those who are not Jews will have the blessing which Abraham had. He did this so that when we believe, we will receive the Spirit who was promised to us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">My brothers, it is the same as when a man makes a promise. He makes it good and strong. Then no one can break it or add anything to it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">God made his promises to Abraham and to his Son. The promise does not have the words, and to his sons, for that means many sons. But it says, and to his Son, and that Son is Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Here is what I mean. The law was given &lt;FI&gt;to Moses&lt;Fi&gt; four hundred and thirty years after God gave that promise to Abraham. But it cannot break the strong promise which God made. And the law cannot change Gods promise.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Do we get what God has promised us by obeying the law? If we do, then we are not getting it by his promise. But God gave it to Abraham by his promise.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Why then was the law made? God gave it after he made the promise, because so many people were doing what was wrong. The law was to be in power only until the Son came,  the one to whom the promise was made. The law was handed down by Gods angels with the help of a middle man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">To need the help of a middle man there must be more than one person making the agreement. But God is the only one who made the promise.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Is the law against the promises of God? No, it is not! If a law had been given that could give people life, then surely people would have become good people by the law.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">But the holy writings say it is like this. The whole world is in prison, kept there by the wrong things they have done. This was done so that people who believe in Jesus Christ would have the blessing. This blessing was promised to those who believe.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Before one came for us to believe in, the law held us in prison like slaves. We were kept there until the one to believe in should come.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">The law watched over us, as if we were children, until Christ came. Then God would put us right with himself through faith in Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">But now that one has come for us to believe in, the law does not watch over us any longer.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">You are all Gods children because you have believed in Christ Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">All of you who have been baptised into Christ have taken Christ as your own.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">There is no longer any difference between a Jew and one who is not a Jew; between a slave and a free man; between a man and a woman. When you are in the body of Christ Jesus, you are all alike.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">If you belong to Christ, you are Abrahams children. And if you are Abrahams children,  you will receive the blessing that God has promised.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="4">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Here is what I mean. When a man dies, his son is to receive his property. As long as the son is not grown up, he cannot have it. He has no more right than a servant, even though he really owns all the property.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">He still has people who take care of him and he must obey them until the time set by his father.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">So it is with us. Before we were grown up, we were like servants. We were just beginning to learn about the things of this world.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">But when the right time came, God sent his Son to make us free. He was born by a woman during the time when men had to obey the law.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">God sent him to set the people free who were under the law. God sent him so that we would receive our rights as sons of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Because you are sons, God has sent the Spirit of his Son into your hearts. The Spirit calls out, Father!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">So then, because of what God has done, you are no longer a slave but you are a son. And because you are a son, you will receive what he promised.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">At first, you did not know God. At that time you obeyed things which are not real gods.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">But now you know God. That is, God knows you. Then why do you turn to things that are weak and can do no good? Do you want to obey them again?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">You have holy days, holy months, holy seasons, and holy years.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">I fear that all my work for you has been for nothing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">My brothers, I beg you, be like me because I am like you. You did me no wrong.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">You know that I was sick when I first told you the good news.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">My sickness troubled you. But you did not think wrongly of me or turn away from me.  You received me as if I were an angel from God, as if I were Christ Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Why are you not happy any more? I saw myself that you would have taken out your own eyes and given them to me if you could do such a thing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Do you hate me because I tell you the truth?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Other people are trying hard to get you on their side. But they do not mean to help you.  They want to get you away from Christ so that you will listen to them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Of course, it is good if someone tries to help you, but only if it is for a good reason. It is always good, not only when I am with you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">My dear children, I feel pain for you again, like a mother when her child is being born. I will feel pain until Christ lives in your heart.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">I wish I could be with you now, and not have to talk this way. But I am troubled about you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Tell me, you people that want the law to control you, why do you not listen to the law?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">The holy writings say that Abraham had two sons. One was the son of the slave woman.  The other one was the son of the free woman.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">The child of the slave woman was born as any child is born. But the child of the free woman was born because God promised he would be born.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">These things have another meaning. These two women are like two agreements. One agreement came from Mount Sinai. The children are born slaves. That agreement is like Hagar.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">So Hagar means Mount Sinai in the country of Arabia. She is like the city of Jerusalem today, because Jerusalem is a slave and her children are too.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">But the city of Jerusalem in heaven is free, and that is our mother.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">The holy writings say, The woman who has not had a child, be happy! You who do not feel the pain of bearing a child, open your mouth and shout. The woman who is left alone has more children than the woman who has a husband!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">My brothers, we are like Isaac. We are born because God made a promise.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Abrahams child who was born as any child is born, troubled the other child who was born by the Spirit. It is that way today.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">But what does the holy writings say? They says, Put away the slave woman and her son.  The son of the slave woman will have nothing when the father dies. The son of the free woman will have everything.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">So, my brothers, we are not the children of the slave woman, but we are children of the free woman.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="5">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Christ has made us really free. So, stay free! Do not let yourselves be made slaves again.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">I, Paul, say to you again that if you let yourselves be circumcised, Christ is no help to you at all.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Again I say to every man who is circumcised, he must obey all the law.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Some of you are trying to obey the law, so that God will call you good. If you do this,  you have been cut off from Christ. You have lost the blessing of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">But we hope to be made right by believing in Christ. The Spirit helps us to do this.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">So if a man belongs to Christ Jesus, it does not matter if he is circumcised or not. He must show by his love that he believes.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="11">My brothers, am I still telling people to be circumcised? If I am, why are people still troubling me? If it were true, the cross of Christ, which they do not like, has lost its power.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">These teachers are troubling your minds. How I wish they would cut themselves off!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">You, my brothers, were called to be free. But do not take that to mean that you can do as you please. But work for each other because you love each other.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="15">But if you bite and chew each other, be careful, or you will be killed by each other.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">So I say, let the Spirit tell you what you should do. Then you will not do the wrong things you yourselves want to do.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">People want to do wrong things that the Spirit does not want them to do. And the Spirit wants people to do things they do not want to do. The Spirit and the wrong things you want to do are against each other, so that you do not do what you yourself want to do.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">If you do what the Spirit wants you to do, then you will be free from the law.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">It is easy to see the wrong things people want to do. Both married people and those who are not married commit adultery. People make themselves unclean because of their wrong use of sex. They do things they should be ashamed of doing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">They worship idols. They use witch-power. They hate. They quarrel. They are jealous.  They get angry. They want their own way. They do not agree together and they join different groups against each other.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">They want what other people have. They even kill. They drink too much strong drink.  They like to take part in loud drinking and dancing. They do other things like these. I have told you before and I tell you again. Those who do these things will not be in the kingdom of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">But these are the things which the Spirit wants you to show: love, joy, peace, patience,  being kind, being good, being true, being gentle, and keeping the body under control.  There is no law that says, These things are wrong.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Those who belong to Christ Jesus have stopped doing the wrong things they want to do.  They have stopped them just as if they were killed on a cross. And they have even stopped wanting to do them.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">I am a prisoner who belongs to the Lord. I beg you, live the way people should live who have been called by God.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">The Spirit has made you all one. Try to stay like that. May you be at peace with one another.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">There is one body of Christ and one Spirit. When God called you, there was one hope before you in your calling.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">There is one Lord, one way to believe, and one baptism.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">There is one God and Father of us all. He is over all. He works through all. And he is living in us all.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">But each one of us has received a blessing, whatever amount Christ has given to each one.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">So then, the holy writings say, When Christ went up to heaven he took those he had won with him. And he gave gifts to men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Now, what does he went up mean? Does it not mean that he also came down to the earth below?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">The one who came down is the same one who went up higher than all the heavens. He did this so that he would be everywhere.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">The gifts he gave are these: some are to be apostles; some prophets; some evangelists;  some pastors and teachers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">These gifts are to make Gods people better able to do their work for him and to make the body of Christ become stronger.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">The gifts are given so that we will all believe the one way and all know the Son of God.  They are given so that we will be really grown-up Christians, like Christ himself.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">The body of Christ must grow so that we will no longer be like children. We are like children when we are pushed this way and that way. We change our minds every time people bring a different teaching. Some teachers teach the lies of men and fool people so that they believe wrong things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">We must say what is true and say it with love. In that way we will grow up in all things to be like Christ, who is the head of this body.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">The whole body is joined and held together by every joint that it has. It is from Christ that the whole body grows as each different part does its work. It grows so that it becomes stronger in love.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Here then is what the Lord has told me to say. You must not live like the people who do not believe in God. They do not think clearly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Their minds are dark. They are far away from Gods life because they do not know the truth. They have no love in their hearts.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Nothing makes them ashamed anymore. They live a very bad life. They do every kind of wrong thing. And they always want to do it more.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">That is not what you have learned from Christ!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">You were taught by him, and Jesus has the truth!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Stop being the person you used to be in your old life. That person was bad because he wanted to do wrong things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Have a new mind and heart.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Be a new person. That new person has been made like God. He does what is right and holy because he knows the truth.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="30">Do nothing that makes the Holy Spirit feel sad. He is the mark God has put on you until the day you will belong to God altogether.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">You must stop all hate, big and small anger, loud talk, saying wrong things about people,  and all wanting to do wrong things to people.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">As Gods people, you should not even talk about wrong living, any kind of wrong sex or wanting things you cannot have.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">There should be no dirty talk, no foolish talk, no funny stories with a wrong meaning.  This is not a good way to talk. But what you should do is thank God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">You know this. There are people who use sex wrongly, and who are always wanting what others have. No such a person has any place in the kingdom of Christ and of God.  He is worshipping an idol.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Do not let anyone fool you by their empty talk. It is because people do these wrong things that God is very angry. He is angry with the people who do not obey him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">So then, have nothing to do with them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">You were in the dark before, but now the Lord has given you light. Live like people who have the light.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="12">It is a shame even to talk about the things they do in secret.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">But when the light shines on something, it can be seen. Anything that shows up wrong ways is light.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">So it is said, Wake up, you who are asleep! Rise from death. And Christ will give you light.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Take care how you live. Do not live like people who are not wise, but live like people who are wise.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Make good use of time because people live in very wrong ways these days.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">So then, be wise and understand what the Lord wants.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Do not get drunk with wine. That is living in a wrong way. But be filled with the Spirit.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="20">Always thank God the Father for all things in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Give way to each other because you respect Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Wives, obey your husbands as you obey the Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">The husband is the head of the wife, just as Christ is the head of the church people. The church is his body and he saved it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Wives should obey their husbands in everything, just as the church people obey Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ loved the church people. He gave his life for the church.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">He did that so that he might make the church people holy, when they were washed with water by Gods word.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">He gave his life for the church so that one day he can look at the church and see that the people are great and wonderful. The people of the church must have no dirty spot or wrinkle or any thing like that. But they are to be holy and good.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">So husbands should love their wives as they love their own bodies. The man who loves his wife loves himself.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">No one ever hated his own body. But he feeds it and takes care of it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">In the same way Christ takes care of the church because we are parts of his body.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">The holy writings say For this reason a man shall leave his father and mother. He shall be joined to his wife, and the two of them shall be like one person.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">This is a wonderful plan of God. I am speaking here of the plan about Christ and the church people.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">I beg you, my real helper, to help these women. They worked hard with me in telling the good news. Clement and my other helpers worked hard with me too. Their names are in Gods Book of Life. Always be glad for what the Lord has done. I will say it again, be glad.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="5">Do not worry about anything. Talk to God about everything. Thank him for what you have. Ask him for what you need.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="7">Here, my brothers, are some things I want you to think about. Think about things that are true, honest, right, clean and pure, things that are lovely, and things that are good to talk about. If they are good, and if they bring praise to God, think about these things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">I taught you, and you learned things from me. You heard the things I said, and you saw the things I did. Do these same things yourselves. Then God who gives peace will be with you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">The Lord made me very happy to know that you were thinking about me again. Yes, I know you were thinking of me before, but you had no way to help me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">I do not mean that I needed it. I have learned to be satisfied with what I have. I am happy with whatever happens to me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">I know how to live when I am poor, and I know how to live when I am rich. No matter how things are, I have learned how to live: when I have plenty of food, or when I am hungry; when I have more things than I need, and when I do not have enough.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">I can do all things because Christ gives me strength.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">But you were kind to help me when I was in trouble.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">You people of Philippi know this too. When I first told the good news after I left the country of Macedonia, you were the only church people who helped me. You sent me money to pay my expenses.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Even when I was in the city of Thessalonica, you sent money to help me more than once.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">It is not that I want the gift. But I want you to have more and more blessing because you give.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">I have all I need and more. Yes, I have plenty because Epaphroditus gave me what you sent me. Your gift was like a sweet-smelling offering to God. It was a sacrifice which God took and it pleased him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">My God will give you everything you need. He has wonderful riches in heaven because of Christ Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Praise God our Father for ever. Yes, he will do it.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="6">That message has reached you. It is doing good and it is spreading everywhere in the world. It is doing the same among you. It began the day you heard and understood Gods blessing, which came to you in a clear way.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Epaphras taught you the truth. He is Christs servant, as we are also, and we love him. He is a good worker to help you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Also, it is he who told us of your love in the Spirit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">That is why we keep on talking to God about you since the day we heard about you. We ask him that you may know everything he wants you to do. We ask him that you may be very wise and that the Spirit will help you to understand.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="23">But you must keep on believing and stand strong and true. Let nothing shake the hope which the good news brought you. You heard the same good news as is told to everyone in the whole world. I, Paul, was given the work of telling that same good news.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And now, even though I suffer for you, I am happy. There are still some things for Christ to suffer in his body, which is the church. So I am glad to take my share of his suffering in my body.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">God gave me work to do for the church people so that you might know all of Gods message.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="12">You were buried with Christ when you were baptised. You were also raised with him to a new life when you were baptised. You were raised because you believed in the power of God who raised Christ from death.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">You were dead because of the wrong things you had done, and because your lives had not been made clean. But God gave you life with Christ. He forgave you for all the wrong things you did.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">He wiped out all the things that were written against us in the laws. He took the writing away and nailed it to a cross.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">He won the victory over powers and rulers. He showed that they had no power at all. He showed the world his victory through the cross.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">So do not let anyone say you are wrong about what you eat or drink, or about a feast, or a special holy day or a Sabbath day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">They are like a shadow of what is to come. But Christ is the body that makes the shadow.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Do not let anyone tell you that you are wrong and that to be humble you must worship angels. He talks about things he has not seen. He is very proud, but he has nothing to be proud of, because his thoughts come from his own mind.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">He is not joined to the real head which is Christ. It is from him that the whole body receives strength and is held together by its joints and muscles. It is from him that the body grows as God makes it grow.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Did you die with Christ? Then you left the teachings of this world. So why do you obey laws as if you were still living in this world?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">I mean laws like this: "Do not touch that. Do not eat this. Do not put your hand on that."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">All such things are gone as soon as they are used. These are laws made and taught by men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">These laws look as if they are good laws. They make a show of doing things for God.  They make people humble themselves in some way. They make people control their bodies in certain ways. But they have no power to keep people from doing all the wrong things they want to do.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="5">So then, put to death those things of this world which are in you. I mean these things:  wrong sex, things that are not clean, a heart that is burning to do wrong things, wanting what is wrong, and wanting to have what other people have. This last one is like worshipping an idol.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">They are things that make God angry.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">You used to do these things when you lived that way.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">But now you must stop all these: being angry, hating people, wrong feelings toward others, saying wrong things about people, and dirty talking.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Do not tell lies to one another. You have stopped being the person you used to be who did wrong things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And now you have become a new person. That new person is always learning more and more until he becomes like God who made him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">In this new person, there is no difference between a Greek and a Jew. There is no difference between a man who is circumcised with the mark of the Jew and a man who is not circumcised. There is no difference between a person from a friendly country or someone from a country which is not friendly. There is no difference between a slave and a person who is free. Christ is everything and is in all of them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">You are chosen by God. He loves you and has made you holy. So then, care for one another. Be kind. Do not be proud. Be humble. Be patient.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Be patient with one another. If any one has a complaint against another, forgive that one.  Christ forgave you. So you should forgive each other.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Beside all these, you must have love. This joins everything together as it should be.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="4">So we are proud of you. We tell the churches of God about you because you are standing strong and you keep on believing in God. Your troubles and hard times do not stop you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">This proves that God will judge right. And he will say that you are good enough for the kingdom of God because you suffer for it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">God will do what is right. He will give trouble to those who are troubling you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And he will give rest to you who are having troubles, and to us also. He will give this rest when our Lord Jesus comes back from heaven. The Lord Jesus will come with his strong angels in flaming fire.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">He will punish those who do not know God, and those who do not obey the good news of our Lord Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">They will be destroyed for ever. That will be their punishment. They will be for ever separated from the Lord and from his great and wonderful power.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">This will happen on the day he comes. On that day his people will show how great and wonderful he is. And all those who have believed in him will be surprised at how great he is. That means you also, because you believed what we told you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">That is why we always talk to God about you. We want our God to make you fit for the good work to which he called you. We ask him to finish his good work of faith which trusts in his power.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">When I went to the country of Macedonia, I asked you to stay in the city of Ephesus. I wanted you to tell some of the teachers not to teach wrong things.</VERS>

It was made for those who do not respect God, and those who are bad people. It was made for those who do not respect anything that is holy or belongs to God. It was made for those who beat their fathers or mothers, and for those who kill people.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="2">We also send greetings to our sister Apphia; to Archippus who is worker in Gods army as we are; and to the people who meet as a church in your house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">May God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ bless you in their kindness and give you peace.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">I always thank my God when I talk to him about you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">I have heard that you love all of Gods people and that you believe in our Lord Jesus Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">You believe as I do. I ask God that he may help you to know more and more of every good thing that we have in Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">My brother, your love made me very glad and it comforted my heart. I know that Gods people were glad because you loved them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Because I am Christs apostle, I could tell you what you must do.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">But because I love you, I would rather not tell you, but ask you to do this for me. I, Paul,  am an old man and now I am in prison because I belong to Jesus Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">I am asking you to do something for my son. He became a Christian here in prison. This son is Onesimus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">At one time he was no help to you. But now he is a big help to you and to me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">I am sending him back to you and it is like sending you my own heart.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">I would like to keep him with me. He can help me while I am in prison for the sake of the good news. That would be just as if you were here to help me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">But I did not want to do anything unless you agreed. I did not want you to do this because you were forced to do it, but because you wanted to do it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Maybe it was good for him to be away from you for a while. Now you will have him with you for ever.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Now he is not like a slave who must work for you. He is better than a slave. He is a Christian brother and you will love him. I love him very much. But you will love him even more because he belongs to you and he is a Christian.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">So if you think of me as a real friend, take him back just as you would take me back.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">If he has done you any wrong, or if he owes you a debt, then ask me to pay it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">I, Paul, write this with my own hand. I will repay it. I do not need to tell you that you have your life because of what I did for you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Yes, my brother, give me some help in the Lord. Make me happy in Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">I believe that you will do what I ask you to do. And so I am writing to you. I know that you will do even more than I ask you to do.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">At the same time, please make a place ready for me to stay. I know you are asking God to set me free, so I believe he will let me come to see you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Epaphras is in prison with me for the sake of Christ Jesus. He sends greetings to you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, and Luke are working with me. They all send greetings too.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">May the loving kindness of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen! May it be so!</VERS>

  <BIBLEBOOK bnumber="58" bname="Hebräer" bsname="Hebr">
    <CHAPTER cnumber="1">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Long ago, God talked to our fathers through the prophets. He talked many times and in many ways.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">In these last days, he talked to us through his Son. God chose him to be the one to whom he would give all things. God also made the world by this Son.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">He shines as bright as God. He is just like God himself. He holds up the world by the power of his word. He made people clean from their wrong ways. Then he sat down beside God in heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">He is much greater than the angels because God has given him a much better name than theirs.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Did God ever say to any of the angels, You are my Son, and I am your Father today? Did God ever say to an angel, I will be your Father and you will be my Son?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">When God brings his first-born Son into the world, he says, All of Gods angels must worship him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Here is what he says about the angels: God makes his angels to be like the winds. He makes his helpers to be like flames of fire.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">But here is what God says about his Son: O God, you will sit and rule for ever. You will rule in the right way.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">You have loved what is good and you have hated what is wrong. That is why God has poured out happiness on you, more than on those who are with you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">He also said, Lord, you made the world in the beginning. The sky was made by your hands.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">These things will come to an end, but you will live on. They will all wear out like clothes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">You will fold up the world and the sky as if they were a blanket. They will not stay as they are now. But you will always be as you are now. The years of your life will never end.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">But did God ever say to any of the angels, Sit down beside me until I put your enemies under you?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Are not all the angels spirits that help? They are sent out to help the people who will be saved.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="2">
      <VERS vnumber="1">That is why we must listen very carefully to the things we have heard. We must never forget them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">What the angels said proved to be true. Every one who broke the law, and who did not obey it, was punished as he should be punished.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">If that is so, then we will not get away without being punished. We will be punished if we forget or throw away this wonderful way to be saved. It was the Lord who first told people how to be saved. Then those who heard him told us the true way.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">God also proved that it was the true way. He gave signs. He did things that surprised people. He did many things by his power. He gave the gifts of the Holy Spirit to people just as he wanted to.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">God did not put the next world under angels for them to rule over. That is the world we are talking about.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">In one place the holy writings say, What is man and why do you think about him? What is the Son of a Man and why do you care about him?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">You made him lower than angels for a little while. But then you made him very great and high.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">You put everything under him for him to rule over. When God gave him the right to rule over everything, nothing was left out which he did not have the right to rule. But we do not yet see him ruling over everything.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">But we do see Jesus! For a short time he was lower than the angels. Because he died, we see him made great and high. He did this so that he could die for every person. God is so good!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Everything was made for God and by God. It seemed good to him that Jesus life should be made complete, by going through the hard things that happened to him. This was because Jesus leads many people to heaven as Gods children. And he is the one who saves them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Jesus, who makes people holy, and those who are made holy, all have one Father in heaven. That is why Jesus is not ashamed to call them his brothers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">He said, I will tell my brothers about you. I will sing praise about you among those who gather together for worship.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">He also said, I will trust God. And again, Here am I and the children God has given to me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Gods children all have a body. That is why Jesus himself had the same. But because Jesus also had a body, he was able to die and stop the devil. The devil has power to make people die. But Jesus, by his own death, was able to stop the power of death.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">People were afraid to die. All their lives they were like slaves. When Jesus died, he was able to set them free from their fear.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Jesus did not come to help angels. He came to help people who were born in Abrahams family.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">So he had to be made like his brothers in every way. Then he could be a high priest to make a way to God for them, a priest who was kind and true. He could make it possible for God to forgive people for the wrong things they had done.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">He had a very hard time when he was tested. But because he was tested, he is able to help people who are tested.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="3">
      <VERS vnumber="1">My brothers, you are holy. You are also called to go to heaven. Take time to think carefully about Jesus. God sent him. He is the high priest we believe in.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">He did what God sent him to do, just as Moses did in Gods house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">But Jesus is much greater than Moses-as the one who builds a house is greater than the house itself.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Every house is built by someone, but God is the one who builds all things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Moses did what he was told to do as a servant in all of Gods house. He showed things that God would say later.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But Jesus Christ was true as a Son over Gods house. We are Gods house if we keep on believing and telling others what we hope to have.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">So as the Holy Spirit says, Today, when you hear me speak, do not make your hearts hard.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">That is what happened when the people tested me in the desert and I became angry.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">There your fathers tested me and tried me. And they saw what I did for forty years.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">So I was very angry with the people of that time. I said, "Their minds are always dark.  They have not known my ways."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">I said when I was angry, "They will never go into my resting place."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">My brothers, take care that not one of you has a heart that does not believe. Such a heart will take you away from the living God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">But talk to each other every day while Today lasts, so that wrong ways will not fool any one of you and your hearts become hard.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">We have our part with Christ if we go on to the end and believe in him as we did at first.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">God is still saying now, Today, when you hear me speak, do not make your hearts hard.  That is what happened when the people turned against me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Who were the people who heard him and yet made him very angry? It was all the people whom Moses led out of the country of Egypt.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">With whom was God angry for forty years? He was angry with the people who had done wrong. And they died in the desert.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Who were the people God said would never go into his resting place? They were the people who would not listen to him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">So then, we see that they could not go in because they did not believe him.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="4">
      <VERS vnumber="1">We still have Gods promise that people will go into his resting place. So let us take care that not one of you will be kept out.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">The good news has been told to us just as it was told to the people in the desert. But the message which they heard did not do them any good. Even though they heard it, they did not believe it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">But we who believe, will go into that resting place of God. It is as God said, When I was angry, I said, "They will never go into my resting place." He said this even though his work had been finished ever since he had made the world.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Here is what he said, somewhere in the holy writings, about the seventh day: And God rested on the seventh day after doing all his work.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And now here he says again, They will never go into my resting place.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">So that means some people will go in. But the people who first heard the good news about it did not go in. They did not believe it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">So he chose another day called Today. He spoke through David many years later, who said, Today, when you hear his voice, do not make your hearts hard.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">If Joshua had led those people to rest, God would not have talked later about another day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">So there is still a rest for Gods people, like a Sabbath day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">The person who goes into Gods resting place will rest after doing his work, just as God rested after doing his work.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">So let us do our best to go into that resting place. Those people died in the wilderness because they did not believe. So let us take care that the same thing does not happen to one of us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Gods word is living and full of power. It is more sharp than any sword that cuts on both sides. What God says cuts through and divides the mind and spirit. It cuts through and divides the place where the bones are joined, and the part inside the bone. What God says is able to judge the things people think and plan in their hearts.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">God is the one we must meet. Nothing can be hidden from him. Everything is open and he can see it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">We have a great high priest who has gone into heaven. He is Jesus, the Son of God.  Because we have such a great high priest, let us hold on to the things we believe.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">We have a high priest who can feel with us when we are weak. He has been tested in every way, just as we are. But he did not do anything wrong.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">So let us trust him when we come to worship God. He is so good. He will be kind to us and help us when we need it.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="5">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Every high priest is chosen from among men. His work is to stand before God for people.  He brings gifts and makes sacrifices to God for the wrong things people have done.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Such a high priest can be kind to people who do not know what is right and who do wrong. He knows how to share in the suffering of others because he himself is weak.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Because he is weak himself, he must make sacrifices to God for the wrong things he has done, just as he does for the people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">No one chooses himself to be high priest. But God calls him, just as he called Aaron.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">So Christ did not choose himself to be a high priest. But he was chosen by the One who said to him, You are my Son, and I am your Father today.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">In another place in the holy writings God said, You are a priest for ever like Melchizedek.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">When Jesus was a man, he talked to God who was able to save him from death. He called loudly to him with tears. God heard him because he honoured and respected God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Even though Jesus was his Son, he learned to obey God in the troubles he had.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">When he became perfect, he saved for ever all who obeyed him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">God called him a high priest like Melchizedek was a priest.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">We have many things to say about him. But they are hard to explain to you. You are so slow to understand what we tell you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">By this time you should be able to teach others. But you need someone to teach you Gods word again from the very beginning. Like children, you need milk, not meat.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Anyone who takes milk does not understand the message about which things are right.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">But meat is for people who are grown up. It is for people who have trained their minds to know the difference between what is good and what is bad.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="6">
      <VERS vnumber="1">So, let us leave behind the first teachings about Christ. And let us go on to things that are grown up. We must not go back to the beginning again and talk about turning away from doing things that bring death to us. We must not go back again and talk about believing in God. Let us go forward.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">We must not go back to teaching about baptizing people in water, about putting hands on peoples heads, about people being raised from death, and about people being judged for ever.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">If God will let us, we will go on to build on these things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Some people had light in their hearts once. They knew the gift from heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">They had the Holy Spirit. They knew the word of God is good and felt the powers of the next world.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">If people who were like that leave their faith in Christ, they cannot come to God again.  They themselves nail Gods Son up on the cross again. They are holding him up to shame before everyone.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">The ground drinks the water that often rains on it. It makes plants grow for the people who take care of it. And God blesses that ground.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">But if it grows thorns and weeds, it is no good. It will soon be cursed. In the end, it will be burned with fire.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">This is the way we talk. But dear people, we are sure that better things are true about you. Yes, you show all the good ways of people who have been saved from their wrong ways.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">God does what is right. He will not forget your work and the love you have shown for him. You have helped Gods people and you are still helping them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">We want every one of you to try in the same way. Then you will get what you hope for right up to the end.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Do not give up. But be like the people who get what God has promised. They believe God and keep on believing for a long time.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">God made a promise to Abraham. God did not have anyone greater than himself to hear his promise.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">So he promised to himself when he said, I will surely bless you and you will have many children.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Abraham kept on believing God. And so he got what God had promised him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">When men make a promise, they ask someone to hear it who is greater than they are.  When someone great has heard a promise, it stops any quarrel about it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">God made a promise to people. He wanted to show them that he would surely do as he said. So he promised to himself to keep the promise.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">These two things cannot be changed and God cannot lie about them. So we can trust him.  We have run to him to get what he has promised us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">This promise gives our hearts something to hold on to. It keeps our hearts strong and steady. It will take us into the Holy Place right inside Gods house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Jesus has gone there ahead of us. He has been made high priest for ever like Melchizedek.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="7">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Melchizedek was king of the city of Salem. He was a priest of God who is the greatest of all. Melchizedek met Abraham when Abraham came back from killing some bad kings.  And Melchizedek blessed him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Abraham divided all that he took away from the kings into ten parts. He gave Melchizedek one part. First, the name Melchizedek means the king who is true and right with God. Then he was king of Salem. That means king of peace.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">He has no father or mother. The names of the family from which he comes are not written down. It is not written down that he was born or that he died. But, like the Son of God, he stays on being a priest for ever.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Just think how great he was! Even Abraham, the father of our people, gave him a tenth,  one part out of ten, of all he brought back.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">The sons of Levi, who are priests, have the right by law to take a tenth of what the people have. These people are their own brothers. They also are Abrahams children.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But Melchizedek was not from Levis family. Yet he took a tenth of what Abraham had.  And he blessed Abraham, to whom God made the promise.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Everyone knows this is true. The person who is blessed is not so great as the person who blesses him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Here, priests take their tenth, but they are people who will die one day. But Melchizedek,  who took his tenth, never dies. The holy writings say it is so.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And we say that Levi, the priest who takes the tenth from the people, gave his tenth through Abraham.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">He was not yet born when Melchizedek met Abraham.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">It was while the sons of Levi were priests that the law was made for the people. If those priests were good enough, why would another priest need to come who was like Melchizedek? Why would he not be like Aaron?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">If the kind of priest is changed, then the law must be changed also.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">The one we are talking about belonged to another tribe. No man from his tribe ever made sacrifices in Gods house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Everyone knows that our Lord Jesus came from the tribe of Judah. And Moses never said anything about priests coming from that tribe.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">You can understand it even better when another priest comes who is like Melchizedek.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">He was not made a priest by law. The law said that the priest must come from a certain tribe. But he was made a priest because he has power to live for ever.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">This is what the holy writings say about him, You are a priest for ever, like Melchizedek.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">The old law given to Moses by God was put away. It was weak and no good.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">The law did not make anything right. But something better has been brought to us. It is Gods promise. And by that promise we come near to God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Also Christ was not made a priest without Gods strong promise. The others were made priests without Gods strong promise.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">But this man was made priest by Gods strong promise. God said to him, The Lord has made a strong promise, and he will not change it. "You are a priest for ever."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Also because of this, Jesus makes a better agreement with God for people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">The other priests were many, because they died and could not go on with their work.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">But because Jesus lives forever, he is a priest for ever and no one takes his place.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Because of that, he is able to save people for ever, if they come to God by him. He lives for ever to talk to God for them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">We needed such a high priest as he is. He is holy. He is good. He has never done any wrong. He has been taken away from among bad people, and taken up higher than the sky.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">He does not need to make sacrifices every day. The other high priests make sacrifices every day, first for the wrong things they have done, and then for the people. He did it once when he offered himself as the sacrifice.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">The law makes men high priests, and they are weak. But the word of Gods promise came after the law. It makes his Son high priest for ever, and he is all right.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="8">
      <VERS vnumber="1">The real point of what we are saying is this. We now have a high priest who sits beside Gods throne or chief chair in heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">He is priest in the true holy place where God lives. The Lord made that place, man did not.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Every high priest is chosen to offer gifts and sacrifices. So this high priest must have something to offer also.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">If he were still on earth, he would not be a priest. There are priests on earth already who offer gifts the way the law says.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">The work they do shows what the work of the priest in heaven is. When Moses made a house for God, here is what God told him to do. He said, Be sure you make everything like I showed you on the mountain.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But Christ has been given a much better work, because he is the man who is between God and men in making an agreement. This is a much better agreement. It was made by better promises.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">If the first agreement had been all right, there would have been no need to make another.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">When the people had done wrong, Gods words to them were, The days will come, the Lord says, when I will make a new agreement with the people of Israel and with the people of Judah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">It will not be like the agreement that I made with their fathers. I made that agreement the day I led them by the hand out of the country of Egypt. But they did not keep their part of my agreement, so I left them alone, the Lord says.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">After those days, the Lord says, I will make an agreement with the people of Israel. This is my agreement. I will put my laws in their minds. I will write them in their hearts. I will be their God and they will be my people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">A man will not need to teach another man, or his brother. He will not say, "Know the Lord," because everyone from the youngest to the oldest will know me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">I will be kind even when they do what is not right, and I will never remember the wrong things they do.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">God says this is a new agreement, and that makes the first one old. When a thing is old and no good, it is about ready to be thrown away.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="9">
      <VERS vnumber="1">The first agreement had laws about worship. And it had a holy place on earth where the agreement was kept.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">A house was made. In the first part of the house were the light, the table, and the bread of God. This first part was called the Holy Place.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">The next part of the house was called the Most Holy Place.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">In the Most Holy Place was a pan made of gold. In this pan a fire could burn to make a sweet-smelling smoke. The box of the agreement was also in the Most Holy Place. It was covered all over with gold. In this box were: the golden pot, which had some of the food God sent from heaven for the people in the desert; Aarons stick which grew flowers on it; and the stones which had Gods agreement written on them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">On top of the box were the shapes of two angels. They showed that God is great. Their wings spread over the cover of the box. It was the place where God showed that he is kind. But we cannot take time to tell about every part of these things now.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">These things were made ready. The priests always went into the first part of the house to do their work for God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">But only the high priest went into the second part. And he went in only once a year. He never went in without taking blood with him. He gave the blood to God for the wrong things he had done and for the wrong things people had done.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">This is how the Holy Spirit showed that the way into the Most Holy Place was not yet open to everybody. It was not open as long as the first house was still standing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">This first part is a picture of the time we are in now. In it gifts and sacrifices are made to God. But they cannot make a persons heart clean to worship God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">These are only things to eat and drink and different kinds of washings. They are laws made for the body until the time when everything is made right again.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">But Christ has come as the high priest of the good things which have come. He went through a greater and better house which was not made by mens hands. It is not a part of this world.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">He did not take the blood of goats and young cows. He took his own blood. And he went into the Most Holy Place just once. He paid for our sins and made us free for ever.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">The priest takes the blood of bulls and goats, and the ashes from a young cow that has been burned. He puts this on the people who have done wrong things. This makes their bodies clean.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">If the blood of animals can do that, then the blood of Christ will clean our hearts much better. Christ gave himself to God as the sacrifice. He did this by the Spirit who lives for ever. He was a perfect sacrifice. He will clean our hearts from useless acts of worship.  Then we can serve the living God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">That is why he is the middle man of a new agreement. He died and paid for the wrong things that were done under the first agreement. Because he is a middle man, those people who are called by God can have what he promised. This will belong to them for ever.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">A person can say who will get his things when he dies. He writes this agreement down.  Before anyone can have them, it must be proved that the person has died.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">The agreement has no power until the one who made it has died. It has no power as long as the one who made it is living.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">So even the old agreement made by God was not begun without blood.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Moses told all the people every part of the law. Then he took the blood of young cows and goats. He put some of the blood on the book of the law itself and on all the people.  He took water and red wool and a plant called hyssop.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">As he did this, he said, This is the blood for the agreement which God has made for you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">In the same way, he put some of the blood on the house he had made for God, and on all the things that were used in worship.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Yes, by the old law almost everything is made clean with blood. If no animal is killed to give blood, then there is no way for people to be forgiven for the wrong things they have done.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">These things on earth show in a little way what things in heaven are like. The things on earth had to be cleaned by the blood of animals. But the things in heaven had to be cleaned with better sacrifices than these.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Christ did not go into a holy place made by mens hands. The holy places on earth only show in a little way what the true holy place in heaven is like. He went into heaven itself.  Now he stands before God for our sake.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Christ did not have to offer himself as a sacrifice many times. He is not like the high priest who went into the Holy Place every year and took blood that was not his own blood.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">If Christ were like him, he would have had to die many times ever since the world was first made. But as it is now, Christ came once in the last days of the world. He came to clean away what is wrong by giving himself as a sacrifice.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">People must die, and after that they will be judged.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">So Christ gave himself as a sacrifice only once. He took on himself the wrong things many people have done. He will come a second time. But he will not come to do anything about the wrong things people have done. He will come to save those who are looking and waiting for him.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="10">
      <VERS vnumber="1">The law can show only a little about the good things that are coming. It cannot show the good things themselves. People come to worship God. But the law can never make them all right by the same sacrifices that are brought every year.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">If the law could make people all right, they would stop making sacrifices. The people who come to worship would be made clean for all time, and they would not remember the wrong things they had done.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">But, by making these sacrifices, they show that they do remember the wrong things they have done.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">The blood of bulls and goats can never clean wrong things from peoples hearts.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">That is why Christ said when he came into the world, You did not want sacrifices and gifts. But you made a body for me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Animals that are burned for sacrifices, and animals killed to clean away the wrong things that people do, did not satisfy you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Then I said, "See, I have come to do what you, God, want me to do." This is what is written about me in the book of the law.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">First he said, You did not want sacrifices and gifts, and animals that are given to be burned as sacrifices, and animals killed to clean away peoples wrong ways. You did not like them. These sacrifices are made to obey the law.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Then he said, See, I have come to do what you want me to do. He took away the first kind of sacrifices so that the second kind would remain.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">God wanted us to be made holy. We have been made holy by Jesus Christ. He made us holy by once making his body a sacrifice.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Every priest stands day after day doing his work. He makes the same sacrifices many times. But these sacrifices can never clean away the wrong things people have done.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">But Christ made one sacrifice to clean away their wrong ways for ever. Then he sat down beside God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Since then, he is waiting till his enemies are put under him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">By one sacrifice Christ has made right for ever all those people who are being made holy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">The Holy Spirit tells us about this also.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">First he said, This is the agreement that I will make with them after those days, says the Lord. I will put my laws in their hearts. I will write them in their minds.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Then he also said, I will never remember the wrong things they have done and the times they did not obey.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">When these wrong things have been forgiven, a sacrifice is not needed for them again.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">So, my brothers, we can go into the Most Holy Place by the blood of Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">He made a new and living way for us. He opened up Gods way specially for us. It lets us through the big curtain or cloth which hides God from us. This happened when Jesus gave his body as a sacrifice.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Also, we have a high priest who has charge of Gods people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">So let us come to him with a true heart. Let us come because we believe all these things.  Let us come with our hearts washed clean from our wrong ways. Let us come with our bodies washed with clean water.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">We must hold on to Gods promise that we have said we believed. And we must never let go. He has promised and he will do it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Let us think of one another and help one another to love and to do good things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Do not stop going to church meetings. Some people do stop. But help each other to be strong. You must do it all the more as you see the Great Day coming closer.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Do we go on doing what is wrong after we know the truth? If we do, then there is no sacrifice any more for the wrong things we do.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">But we will be judged, and that makes us fear. Gods anger will be like a very hot fire that will burn up those who are against him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Any man who broke the law of Moses was killed, if two or three people proved that he had broken the law. He will not be forgiven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">But the person who should have much bigger punishment is the one who turns against the Son of God. That person was made holy by the blood of the new agreement and then calls it nothing. He no longer honours and respects the Spirit who has been so kind to him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">We know God who has said, I am the one who will punish people. I will repay them.  Also, The Lord will judge his people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">People should fear very much to be punished by the living God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">Remember the first days when you had the light of Gods truth. In those days you were strong, even though you had to fight against many troubles.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">Sometimes it was because people said and did wrong things to you and everybody saw it.  And sometimes it was because you stood with others who had wrong things done to them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">You shared in the troubles of those who were in prison. When your things were taken from you, you were happy. You knew that you had better things in heaven, things that would always belong to you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">So do not stop believing God now. Your faith will bring you much reward.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">You must not give up believing. Then you will do what God wants you to do. Then you will get what he promised you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">The holy writings say In a little while, the one who is to come will come. He will not wait any longer.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">If a person does what is right because he believes in God, he will live. If he turns back, I will not be pleased with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">We are not the people who turn back and so are lost. But we are people who believe, and so we are saved.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="11">
      <VERS vnumber="1">If people believe God, then they know they have the things they hope to get. It is the proof of things we do not see.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">There were people long ago believed God. He said they were good because they believed him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">We believe in God, so that is how we know that God made the world by his word. The things we see were made out of things that cannot be seen.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Because Abel believed God, he made a sacrifice that pleased God more than the one Cain made. Because Abel believed God, God showed that he was good. God was pleased with his gifts. Abel died. But because he believed God, he still speaks to us through his faith.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Because Enoch believed God, he was taken up into heaven without dying. The people could not find him because God had taken him. Before he was taken up, the holy writings say that he pleased God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">If a person does not believe God, he cannot please him. Anyone who comes to God must believe that God is real. And he must believe that God will bless those who try to find him. God will reward a person, if he really tries to find God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">God told Noah about things that would happen. These things had never happened before.  Noah believed God; he respected God. He built a big house on a boat, and so his family was saved &lt;FI&gt;from the big flood&lt;Fi&gt; . By believing God he showed that the other people were wrong. He was put right with God because he believed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">God called Abraham to go away to a place which he would have as his own. Because Abraham believed God, he obeyed him. He went even though he did not know where he was to go.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Because he believed God, he lived like a stranger in the land God promised him. He lived in tents with Isaac and Jacob. They had the same promise he had.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Abraham was looking for a city which will last for ever. It was the city God planned and made.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Sarah also believed God, and she was able to have a baby even though she was too old to have children. But she trusted God to do what he had promised.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Abraham was too old to be a father, but a great nation was born from that one man.  They are as many as the stars in the sky and as the sands on the seaside. No man can count them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">These people all died still believing God. They did not get the things God had promised them. But they saw them far away and were glad to see them. They said they did not belong to this world, but were only travelling in it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">People who say such things mean they are looking for a country which will be their own.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">If they had wanted the country they left behind, they could have gone back to it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">But now they want a better country. They want a place in heaven. That is why God wants to be called their God. He has made a city ready for them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Abraham believed God when he was tested. The test was to give Isaac as a sacrifice.  Abraham gave up his only son, even though God had made a promise to him about Isaac.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">God had said to Abraham, Isaacs children will be called your family.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Abraham said in his heart that God could bring Isaac back to life. And so it was just as if he did get his son back.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Isaac believed God. He gave Jacob and Esau blessings that were to come.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="26">He thought it was better to take shame, as Christ did, than to be a rich man in Egypt. He was looking for Gods blessings.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">He believed God and left Egypt. He was not afraid of the kings anger. He was strong because he saw the one who cannot be seen.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">He believed God and obeyed his law about the Passover Feast, and put blood on the door posts. He did this so that the angel who killed the oldest sons of the Egyptians, would pass over. Then he would not kill the oldest sons in the families of the Jews.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">The people believed God and went through the Red Sea on dry land. When the people of Egypt tried to do that, they were drowned.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">The people believed God and walked around the walls of the city of Jericho for seven days. The walls fell down.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Rahab was a woman who used her body wrongly for sex to get money. But she believed in God, so she did not die with the people who did not believe in God. This was when the men came to spy out her country. She took them into her house in peace.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="33">Men believed God and were able to win over other nations. They made people do what was right. They got what God promised them. They were not eaten by lions.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">The big, hot fire did not burn them. They got away from men who wanted to kill them with long knives or swords. They were weak, but they became strong. They became very strong to fight. They drove away the armies of their enemies.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">Women had children who died and were raised to life again. Some people allowed themselves to be beaten to death. They would not go free because they wanted to rise again to a better life.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="12">
      <VERS vnumber="1">We have all these people all around us, proving to us that we should believe God. So then,  like people running a race, we must take off everything that is heavy. We must put off all wrong, wrong things that get in our way. We must not stop running until we reach the mark that has been put in front of us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">We must keep our eyes on Jesus. He believed from first to last. What was put in front of him made him glad, so he did not give up when the people nailed him on a cross. He did not care about the shame. And now he is sitting beside God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Think about him. He did not give up when bad people said wrong things about him.  When you think about him, you will not become tired and your hearts will not give up.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">You have been fighting against bad people. But you have not been hurt very much.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">You have forgotten the words spoken to you as sons. My son, when the Lord punishes you, do not think it is a little thing. Do not give up when he tells you that you do wrong.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">The Lord punishes the person he loves. And he beats every son he takes into his family.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Do not give up when you are punished. God is treating you like sons. Is there a son who has never been punished by his father?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">You are punished like the other children in the family. If you are not, you do not belong to the family as the other children do.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And what is more, our fathers on earth punished us and we respected them. We should obey even more the Father of our spirits. If we do, we will live.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Our fathers on earth punished us for a short time the way they wanted to. But God punishes us the way it is good for us. He is holy and good, so he wants us to become holy also.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">At the time a person is punished, he is not glad. He is sad. But after it is over, there is peace. Then those who are trained by it do what is right.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="1">
      <VERS vnumber="1">I am James. I am a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ. I send greetings to all of Gods people wherever they live.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">My brothers, be very happy when you are tested by having troubles of many kinds.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">You know this, that when you prove you believe, you become stronger to take troubles.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">But you must keep on being strong to take trouble. Then you will be all right in every way. You will not need anything more.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">If any of you need to be wise, ask God to make you wise. He gives plenty of wisdom to all people. He is not angry because you ask him. He will make you wise.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But when you ask, you must believe that God will do it. You must not doubt and think,  Perhaps God will not do it. A person who doubts is like a wave on the sea. The wind drives it this way and that way.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">That person must not think that he will get anything from the Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">A person like that has two minds. He cannot go straight in any of his ways.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">A Christian brother who is poor should be glad: he is in a high place now he is a Christian.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">A Christian brother who is rich should be glad: he is in a low place now he is a Christian.  A rich man will pass away like a flower on the grass.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">The sun shines and is very hot. Then the grass dries and its flower falls off. It was nice at first, but now it is not nice any more. In the same way, the rich man will die while he is going around trying to make money.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">God will bless any man who is strong to take his trouble, when he is being tested. When he has proved he is strong, he will live for ever. That is what the Lord has promised to those who love him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">No one who wants to do something wrong should say, God is trying to make me do this wrong thing. God cannot do anything wrong.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">It is their own heart which is wrong. That is why he wants to do something wrong. It fools him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Then the wrong in his heart makes him do the wrong thing. And the wrong thing he has done leads to death.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">My dear brothers, do not fool yourselves.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Every good thing and every fine gift comes from heaven. It comes from the Father of all light. He does not change and he makes no shadow by turning.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">He made us his children because he wanted us. He made us his children by giving us his true word. He made us his children so that we would be the first and best of all he made.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">My dear brothers, do not forget this. Every man should be quick to listen, slow to speak,  and slow to be angry.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">When a man is angry, he does not do what God says is right.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">So stop all your dirty living. Stop doing so many wrong things. Listen quietly to the word that has been put in your hearts. It is able to save you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">But obey Gods word. Do not just listen to it. If you just listen to it, you fool yourselves.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Anyone who just listens to the word, and does not obey it, is like a man who looks at his face in a looking glass.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">He looks at himself and goes away, and right away he forgets what he looked like.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">But there is a law that is all right. It sets people free from their old ways. Anyone who looks into that law and remembers it, is happy because he obeys the law. He does not just listen to the law and forget it, but he obeys what the law says.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Some of you think that you are doing what God wants. But you are not careful what you say. If you are like that, you are fooling yourself. And you are not doing what God wants.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">This is what God the Father wants. It is clean and right. Go and help those who have no father and mother. Go and help widow women whose husbands are dead. These people have troubles. And keep yourself clean from the wrong things in the world.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="2">
      <VERS vnumber="1">My brothers, you believe in our Lord, the wonderful Jesus Christ. So you must not think one man is better than another.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">A man comes in to your church meeting. He has a gold ring and wears fine clothes. A poor man also comes in. He wears old clothes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">You look at the man who wears fine clothes. And you say to him, Sit here on this good chair. But you say to the poor man, Stand over there, or you say, Sit on the floor by my feet.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">If you do these things, you think some people are better than others. You are wrong when you judge people this way.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Listen, my dear brothers. God has chosen people who are poor in this world. They believe very much. They will have a place in the kingdom which he has promised to give to those who love him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But you made the poor man ashamed. Is it not the rich people who trouble you? Are not they the ones who take you to court?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Are not they the ones who say wrong things about the good name you have?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">The holy writings say, Love your neighbour as you love yourself. If you obey this law of your King you do well.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">But if you think one man is better than another, that is wrong. The law says you are a bad person.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Anyone who obeys the law, but then breaks one of the laws, has broken all the laws.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">God made the law, Do not use sex wrongly. God also made the law, Do not kill.If you do not have wrong sex, but you kill, you have broken the law.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">There is a law that makes people free. It is the law of showing kindness. Always talk and live like men who will be judged by that law.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">When God judges, he will not be kind to a person who has not been kind. It is better to be kind than it is to judge people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">My brothers, perhaps a man says, I believe. What good is that if he does not do anything? Can just believing save him?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Perhaps a brother or a sister needs clothes and has no food.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Perhaps one of you says to them, God bless you. Be warm. Eat all you want. But what good is that if you do not give them what they need for their bodies?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Believing is like that. If it does not do anything it is no good. Belief by itself is dead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">In that case someone may say, You believe. And I do good things. Try to show me that you believe without doing any acts of kindness. I will show you that I believe by doing acts of kindness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">You believe that there is one God. That is right. But even the bad spirits believe that. And they shake with fear.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">You are foolish! Believing is no good if it does not do anything good. Do you want to know that for sure?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Look at Abraham. God called our father Abraham a good man. This was because he gave his son Isaac to God on the holy table for a sacrifice.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">You can see he believed. His faith and the things he did worked together. His believing was made all right because he did something.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">The words of the holy writings came true. They say, Abraham believed God. And he was called a good man because of it. In another place he was called Gods friend.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">You see, a man is a good man because of the things he does, and not just because he believes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Rahab was a bad woman. But in the same way God called her a good woman because of something she did. She took the men into her house and then let them go out another way.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">A body is dead if it does not breathe. In the same way, believing is dead if it does not do anything good.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="3">
      <VERS vnumber="1">My brothers, not many of you should be teachers. You know that we who teach will be punished more than other people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">We all do many wrong things. Any man who never says anything wrong is right in every way. He is able to make his whole body do what is right.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">We put a piece of iron in the mouths of horses so they will obey us. Then we can make their whole bodies go where we want them to go.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Look at the big boats also. They are very big. The strong winds push them along. But a man uses a small piece of wood and makes the boat go where he wants it to go.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">A persons tongue is like that. It is a small part of the body but it talks about big things. A very small fire can burn a big pile of wood!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">The tongue is like a fire. It is like a whole world of trouble. It is a part of our body. And it makes our whole body bad. It burns up our whole life. And the fire that makes the tongue burn comes from hell.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">People have been able to tame all kinds of animals, birds, snakes, and fish.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">But no one can tame the tongue. It is a bad thing that will not be ruled. It is full of poison that can kill.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">We praise our Lord and Father with our tongues. And we speak wrong words about people with our tongues, even though they were made like God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Praising and wrong words come out of the same mouth! My brothers, this should not be so.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Do good water and bad water both come from the same place?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">My brothers, do olives come from a fig tree? Or do figs come from a vine? No, they do not! Salt water and fresh water do not both come from the same place.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Who among you is wise and knows about things? He should show what he knows by his good life. He will not be proud because he is wise.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Are you a person who is very jealous? In your hearts you want to be better than others?  Then stop being proud of yourself. Do not say what is not true.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">God did not give you wisdom like that. But it comes from this world. It comes from people. It comes from bad spirits.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">If people are jealous of others, their lives are not right. They do every kind of wrong thing to get what they want. They confuse and upset people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">First of all, when God makes people wise, they are holy. They do not fight. They are gentle. They listen to what other people say. They are very kind and do many good things. They do not quarrel. They do not say what is not true.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">People who do not quarrel have peace. When there is peace, there is a good life.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="4">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Why do you fight and quarrel? It is because your feelings are fighting inside of you. That is why you fight.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">You want something but you cannot get it. Then you kill. You want something very much and cannot get it. So you quarrel and fight. You do not get it because you do not ask God for it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">You ask for it, but you do not get it, because you ask in a wrong way. You want to use it for yourselves and not for others.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">You people promised God you would be true to him, but you did not stay true! Do you not know that if you love the world you hate God? Anyone who wants to be a lover of the world makes himself an enemy of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">The holy writings say, God gave his Spirit to live in us. And that Spirit wants us for himself. Do you think this means nothing?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But God helps you even more than that. That is why the holy writings say, God fights against those who are proud, but he helps those who are not proud.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">So let God control you. Fight the devil and he will run away from you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Come to God and he will come to you. You bad people, make your hands clean! You love what is good and what is wrong at the same time. Make your hearts clean.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Be sad about this, and cry. Turn your laughing into crying. Stop being happy. Be sad.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Do not be proud before the Lord. Then he will lift you up.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">My brothers, do not say wrong things about each other. A man who says wrong things about his brother or judges his brother is saying wrong things about Gods law and he is judging Gods law. If you judge the law, you are not obeying the law, but you are a judge.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">God made the law and he is the judge. And he is the one who can save you or kill you.  Who are you that you should judge your neighbour?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Listen to me! You say, Today or tomorrow we will go to that town. We will stay there a year. We will buy and sell and get rich. But you do not know what will happen to you tomorrow.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">What is your life like? It is like a cloud. It is here for a little while and then it is gone.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">You should say If the Lord wants to do it, we will live and do this or that.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">But now you talk about the big things you will do. All that kind of talk is wrong!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">But if a person knows what he should do and he does not do it, he has done something wrong.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="5">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Rich people, listen to me! Cry loud and long because of the troubles you will have.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Your things are spoiled. Bugs have eaten your clothes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Your gold and silver are all spoiled. The wrong in them will prove that you have done wrong. The wrong will burn you up like fire. You have kept all these things and now time is almost ended.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Listen! Men worked in your fields to cut your grain and you did not pay them! That money shouts against you. The men who cut your harvest have called out to the Lord who has power and he has heard them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">You have had a good time on earth. You have done anything you wanted to do. Your lives are full of everything. Like a fat animal, you will soon be killed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">You have punished good people. You have killed them. And they do not stop you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">So brothers, take your troubles quietly and wait until the Lord comes. A farmer waits until the harvest grows from the ground. He waits for it a long time until it has had the first and second rain.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">You must wait also. Keep your hearts strong, because the Lord will come soon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Brothers, do not say mean things to each other. If you do, you will be judged. Listen, the judge is standing at the door now.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">My brothers, look at the lives of the prophets of God who spoke in the name of the Lord.  See the troubles they had. They took them and waited. Do as they did.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">God blesses those who take their troubles quietly and keep on believing. You have heard about Jobs troubles and how he took them. And you have seen what the Lord did for him at the end. The Lord is very kind and helps people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">My brothers, here is something that matters very much. When you make a promise do not ask heaven to hear it, or the earth, or any other thing. When you mean Yes, just say,  Yes. And when you mean No, just say, No. If you do that, you will not be judged.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Is any one of you in trouble? He should talk to God about it. Is any one of you happy? He should sing songs of praise to God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Is any one of you sick? He should call for the leaders of the church people. They should talk to God about him and put oil on him in the name of the Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Because they talk to God, and believe, he will hear them. The sick man will be healed.  The Lord will make him well again. If the sick man has done wrong things, the Lord will forgive him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">So tell one another the wrong things you have done. And tell God about each others needs, so that you will be healed. When a good man talks to God, big things can be done.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Elijah was a man like us. He asked God not to let it rain. And for three years and six months it did not rain on the earth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Then he talked to God again. And it rained. Plants grew on the earth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">My brothers, has one of you left the right way? Has another person brought him back again?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Do not forget that the person who has brought a man back from his wrong ways will save that man from death. He will cover up many wrong things and be forgiven.</VERS>

  <BIBLEBOOK bnumber="60" bname="1 Petrus" bsname="1Petr">
    <CHAPTER cnumber="1">
      <VERS vnumber="1">I am Peter. I am an apostle of Jesus Christ. I send this letter to Gods chosen people. You are like people on a journey. You live in the countries of Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia,  Asia, and Bithynia. But you do not belong there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">God the Father chose you as he planned to do long ago. You were made holy by the Spirit. You were chosen to obey Jesus Christ and to be made clean by the blood of his death. May you have much blessing and peace.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Praise the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ! He was very kind to us, and made us his children. So we have a new hope. This hope is a living hope because Jesus Christ was raised from death.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Because we are Gods children, one day we shall receive special blessings. They cannot be spoiled in any way, and they will last for ever. They are kept safe in heaven for you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">You are saved by Gods power because you believe. You will then be fully saved. The way is ready and you will see it when the end of time comes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">This makes you very glad, even though now maybe you are sad because you have troubles of many kinds. They are only for a short time.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">To believe is worth more than to have gold. Gold can spoil, but it is tested by fire to show that it is good. So troubles test you to prove that you believe. Then, because you really believe, you will be praised and made great and have honour when Jesus Christ comes again.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">You love him even though you have not seen him. You trust him even though you do not see him. And so you are very happy. No words can tell how happy you are. Your joy is very great.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">God will reward you because you have believed. You will then be fully saved.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">The prophets of God long ago told about this way of being saved. They tried to find out about it and asked much about it. They spoke words from God telling about the blessing God would give you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">The Spirit of Christ in them showed them that Christ would have troubles and after that he would be great. They tried to find out when these things would happen or how things would be when they did happen.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">The Spirit showed them that they told these things not for themselves, but for you. And now the men who told you the good news have told you these same things. They spoke by the power of the Holy Spirit who was sent from heaven. Even the angels wanted very much to know about these things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">So think clearly. Keep awake. When Jesus Christ comes, he will bring you blessing. Set all your hope on that.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Be children who obey. Do not be like what you were before you knew Christ. Then you did anything you wanted to do.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">But be holy in all the things you do. Be holy because the one who has called you is holy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">God says in the holy writings, You must be holy, because I am holy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">You call God your Father. He does not think one man is better than another. He judges everyone by what he has done. So then you must fear him as you live your life here on earth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">You know this. You lived the way your fathers taught you to live, and it was not a good way to live. You were bought and set free from that way of life. But you were not bought with silver or gold money, which can spoil.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">You were bought with blood that is worth much. It is like the blood of a sheep that is perfect with nothing wrong in its body. You were bought with the blood of Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Before the world was made God chose Christ to do it, and Christ came at the end of time for your sake.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">It is through Christ that you believe in God. God raised Christ from death and made him great. And that is why you are able to believe and hope in God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">You have obeyed what is true and that has made your hearts clean. And now you really love your Christian brothers. So with your clean hearts, love each other very much.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">You have been made Gods children. He did not make you his children by something that dies, but by something that cannot die. That is the word of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">The holy writings say, People may be great. But they are like a flower on the grass. The grass dies and the flower falls off.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">But the word of the Lord cannot die! And this word is the good news which has been told to you.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="2">
      <VERS vnumber="1">So stop all the wrong things you do. Stop all the ways you cheat people. Stop fooling people. Stop being jealous. Stop saying wrong things about people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Babies who have just been born want milk very much. In the same way, you should want Gods word. That is like good milk. It will make you grow up so that you will then be fully saved.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">You should want Gods word if you have already tasted and know that the Lord is good.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Come to the Lord Jesus. He is like a living stone. People did not want to use it. But God chose it. It was worth very much to him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">You also are like living stones. You are being built into a temple, a holy place for God.  You are to be holy priests there. You are to give sacrifices to God from your heart. God will accept them because of Jesus Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">The holy writings say, Listen, I am placing a stone in Zion. It is the main stone of the house. I have chosen it and it is worth very much. Anyone who believes in him will not be ashamed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">He is worth very much to you who believe in him. But some people do not believe in him.  To them he is, the stone that the men who were building would not use. But now it is the chief stone at the corner.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And to them he is also, a stone on which people will hit their feet, and a rock that will make them fall down. They hit their feet on it, because they do not obey the word. It was planned that this would happen to them! But you are a chosen people. You are priests to your king. You are a holy nation. You are Gods very own people. All this is so that you will tell how good he is. He called you out of darkness into his wonderful light.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">At one time you were not Gods people. But now you are Gods people. At one time you did not know Gods kindness. Now you do.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Dear brothers, you are people who do not belong to this world. You are like visitors who are on a journey. I beg you, do not do the things your body wants to do. Those things fight against your soul.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Live good lives among the people who do not believe. They may talk about you as if you do wrong things. But when they see the good things you do, they will praise God on the day he comes to help you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Obey every officer of the government to please the Lord. Obey the king because he is over all.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Obey the rulers because they are sent by him. They are sent to punish those who do wrong things and to praise those who do good things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">That is what God wants you to do. He wants you to do good things. By doing good things, you will stop foolish people from saying wrong things about you. They say wrong things about you because they do not know you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">You are free people. But do not think, I am free so I can do wrong things. You are Gods servants.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Respect all men. Love your Christian brothers. Fear God. Respect the king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Servants, respect and obey your masters in all things. Obey not only those who are good to you. But also obey those who are hard on you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Maybe a person is punished when he has done nothing wrong. If he takes these troubles to please God, he does a very good thing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">What praise will you have if you take a beating when you have done something wrong?  But when you do right and are punished, if you take it quietly, God is pleased.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">You have been called to do this because Christ also was punished for you. He showed you what you should do. So do as he did.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">He did no wrong. And he told no lie.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">When people said wrong things to him, he did not say wrong things to them. When he was punished, he did not say, I will do something to you! But he trusted in God who judges what is right.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Christ in his own body took the wrong things we have done to the cross. He did this so that we would stop our bad ways and live right. Because he was punished, you were healed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Like lost sheep, you were going away from God. But now you have come back to the one who takes care of you and helps you.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="4">But you must be fine in your heart. Have a heart that is gentle and quiet. That will not wear out. And God thinks it is worth very much.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">There were holy women long ago who trusted in God. They made themselves nice in this way. They obeyed their husbands.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Sarah obeyed Abraham. She called him her master. You are her children if you do what is right and are not afraid of trouble.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Husbands, also live with your wife the way you know is right. Respect her because she is a woman. She is not as strong as a man. Also respect her because God has given her, as well as you, the blessing of life. In this way, you will not stop God from doing what you ask him to do.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Here is one thing more. You must all agree. You must care when others have trouble.  You must love your Christian brothers. You must be kind. You must not be proud.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">You must not do wrong things to those who do wrong things to you. You must not say wrong things to those who say wrong things to you. But ask God to bless those people.  This is what you have been called to do. Then God will bless you.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="11">He must turn away from anything wrong and do what is good. He must try hard to find peace, and keep on looking for it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">The Lord watches over those who do good. He listens when they talk to him. But the Lord is against those who do wrong things.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="17">It is better to have trouble for doing right, if God allows it, than to have trouble for doing wrong.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">For Christ died that once because of our wrong ways. He was good and he died for those who were bad. He did this to bring us to God. His body died, but his spirit had new life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">His spirit went and gave his message to peoples spirits who were in prison.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">In the days long ago, they did not obey God. God waited for them to do so while Noah was building the big house on the boat. A few people, only eight, were saved by going through the water.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">The water of baptism is like that. It saves you. It does not save you because it washes dirt from your bodies. But it saves you because you bring yourselves to God with a clean heart. It saves you because Jesus Christ has been raised from death.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">In the time past you did the same things as people who do not believe God. Let that be enough. You did things you should be ashamed of. You did what you wanted to do. You got drunk. You got into fights. You took part in noisy feasting with dancing. You did wrong by worshipping idols.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Those people are surprised now that you do not do the same wrong things they do. And they say wrong things about you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">They will have to explain what they are doing. They will have to talk to God about what they have done. He is ready to judge living people and dead people.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">I am Simon Peter. I am a servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ. I send greetings to you who have believed as we have. Believing is worth just as much to you as it is to us. This is because our God and Saviour, Jesus Christ, is right and good.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">May the loving kindness of God bless you and give you more and more peace because you know God and Jesus our Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Christ is God and by his own power he has given us everything that we need to live and to please God. He has given this to us because we know him, and he has called us because he is great and good.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Because of these things, he has promised us things that are worth very much and are very great. He has promised these things to us so that by them you may become like God too.  By them you will be kept free from the selfish desires of the people in the world. These desires lead to death.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">So now you believe, try to live a good life. When you live a good life, try to learn more about God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">When you have learned more, be strong to do what is right. Then go on doing what is right, even if it is hard. As you go about doing right, keep close to God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">As you keep close to God, love your Christian brothers. When you love your Christian brothers, love everyone!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">If you do these things and you do them more and more, you will be good Christians and you will know more and more about our Lord Jesus Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">But the man who does not do these things is like a blind man. He can see only a little way. He has forgotten that he was made clean from the wrong things he used to do.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">So my brothers, try to show that God has called you and chosen you. If you do these things, you will never fall.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">That will make it easy for you to go into the kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. His kingdom will be for ever.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">I do want always to bring these things to your minds. I will do this even though you know them, and even though you are strong in the true way that you already have.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">I think it is right, as long as I live, to keep these things in your minds.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">I know that I will not live long now. Our Lord Jesus Christ has told me about that.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">But I will try to see that you have something to bring these things to your minds, even after I am gone.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">We have told you about the power of our Lord Jesus Christ and that he is coming again.  We did not tell you stories someone told us. We ourselves saw how great he is.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">God the Father praised him and showed that he is great. A voice came from the bright cloud and said to him, This is my Son. I love him and he pleases me very much.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="20">First you must understand this. The words from the prophets in the holy writings did not come from their own minds.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">The prophets did not say what they wanted to say. But the Holy Spirit made them speak.  And they spoke Gods message.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="2">
      <VERS vnumber="1">But prophets who were not true were also among the people of Israel. Also there will be teachers who will not be true among you. They will bring in wrong teaching that leads to death. They will even say that they do not belong to the Master who bought them. And so they will quickly bring themselves to death.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Many people will do the same wrong things they do. And because of them, men will say wrong things about the true way.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Because they are greedy for money, they will trick you with lies. For a long time God has planned to punish them. They will be punished at the right time.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">God punished the angels who did wrong. He put them into the darkest part of hell. They must be kept there until the time when they will be judged.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">In the days long ago, God punished the world. But he saved Noah who told people what was right. And God saved seven other people. But he made water cover the world full of bad people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">God burned up the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah. He punished them so that no cities were left. He did this to show what would happen to bad people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">But God saved Lot out of the trouble. Lot was a good man. He did not like the wrong way the bad people lived.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">That good man lived among the bad people and he saw and heard what they did. Day after day, the bad things they did troubled his heart because he was a good man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">The Lord knows how to save good people out of the trouble that tests them. And he knows how to keep bad people until the day when he will judge them. And they are being punished even now.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Most of all, he will punish people who do the wrong things they want to do and who will not obey the men who rule over them. They are very bold and proud. They do not fear to say wrong things about those who are great, even about the angels.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Angels have more strength and power than they. And yet the angels do not judge them and say wrong things about them to the Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">These people are like animals that cannot think. They are like animals that are born to be caught and killed. They say wrong things about things they do not understand. They will die like the animals.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Bad things will happen to them because they have done wrong things. They think it is fun to have a good time during the day. They are like spots and sores. They like to eat and drink at the love feasts with you. They are trying to fool you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">They are always looking for women to have sex with them. They never stop their wrong ways. They fool people whose hearts are not strong to do right. They always want more and more money. Gods curse is on them!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">They have left the right road and have done wrong. They follow the same road that Balaam walked. He was the son of Beor. He loved the pay he would get for doing a wrong thing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">But he was told to stop doing wrong. The animal he was riding talked with a mans voice.  It tried to make the prophet stop his foolish way.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">These men are like wells with no water in them. They are like fog that is blown away by a strong wind. A very dark place has been kept to put them in.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">They say big and foolish things. They fool people who have just left those who live in wrong ways. They fool them by making them want to do wrong things with their bodies.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">They promise them that they will be free. But they themselves are slaves of death. A man is a slave of anything that rules over him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">They left the wrong ways of the world because they knew our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. Then when they went back to the wrong ways again, they were ruled by them.  Then they will have more trouble than they had at first.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">It would have been better for them if they had never known the right way! Because they knew the right way, it was very wrong for them to turn from the holy law God gave them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">They show that this saying is true, The dog goes back to eat what his own stomach threw up! and, A pig that is washed rolls in the mud again!</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">Here is the first thing. In the last days, men will come who will make fun of holy things.  They will do what they themselves want to do.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">They will say, He promised to come. Where is he? Our fathers have died. And since then everything is just the same as it has been since the world was made.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">They do not want to remember that long ago God spoke and made the sky. He made the land come up from the water.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But later on these same waters covered the world in a flood and the people died.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">The sky and the earth that are here now are being kept because God spoke. They are kept to be burned up. This will happen on the day when God judges people and they will die.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">My dear brothers, do not forget this one thing. One day is like a thousand years to the Lord. And a thousand years are like one day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">God will do what he promised. He is not slow though, as some people think he is. But he is waiting a long time for you. He does not want anyone to die, but he wants all people to stop their wrong ways.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">The day of the Lord will come like a man who wants to steal. There will be a loud noise and the sky will go away. The elements will melt with fire and they will be gone. The earth and everything on it will be burned up.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">That is the way the whole world will go. So think what kind of people you should be!  Think how holy and true to God your lives should be!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">You should look for the day of God and do everything you can to make it come quickly.  On that day the sky will be on fire and go away. The elements will burn and melt away.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="14">My dear brothers, you are looking for these things. So do all you can so that the Lord will find you without any bad or wrong thing in your lives. Let him find you at peace with one another.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Think of this. He is waiting a long time so that people will be saved. Our dear brother Paul also wrote these things to you, because God has made him wise.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">He also tells about them in all his letters. Some things in his letters are hard to understand. Some people do not know about these things and they are not strong in their faith. They change the meaning of the things Paul wrote. They do this to other things in the holy writings also. Because they do this, they will die.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">My dear brothers, you know about these things before they happen. Take care that you do not do the same things that bad people do. Take care that you do not stop believing the right way.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Have more and more of Gods blessing and kindness. Learn more and more about our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. He is great now, and he will be great for ever! Amen! Yes he will!</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="2">My dear brothers, we are Gods children now. No one knows yet what we shall be like.  But we know that when Jesus comes, we will be like him. We will see him as he really is.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Everyone who has this hope about Christ makes his life holy. He makes his life holy and clean, just as Christ is holy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Everyone who does wrong things is breaking Gods law. Doing wrong things is breaking the law.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">You know that Christ came to take away the wrong things people have done. He is the one who has done no wrong.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Everyone who stays with him does not do wrong things. Everyone who does wrong things has never seen him and has never known him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">My children, do not let anyone fool you. Anyone who does what is good, is good just as Christ is good.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Anyone who does what is wrong belongs to the devil. The devil has done what is wrong from the beginning. That is why Gods Son came. He came to stop what the devil does.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">No one who is Gods child does wrong things, because Gods life is in him. And he cannot keep on doing wrong things, because he is Gods child.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">This is how people can know who are Gods children and who are the devils children.  Everyone who does not do right is not Gods child. And anyone who does not love his brother is not Gods child.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">This is the word you have heard from the beginning. We must love one another.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">We must not be like Cain. He was a child of the devil and killed his brother. Why did he kill him? He killed him because the things he himself did were wrong, and the things his brother did were right with God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">My brothers, do not be surprised if people in this world hate you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">We know that we have gone from death to life. We know this because we love the Christian brothers. Anyone who does not love them has not gone from death to life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Everyone who hates his brother is like a man who kills a person. And you know that no one who kills a person has life that will live for ever.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Christ died for us. That is how we know what love is. We also should be willing to die for our brothers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Perhaps a man has plenty of food and things. He sees that his brother needs some. If he does not want to help his brother, does he love God?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">My children, we must not only talk about loving people; we must show we love people by what we do for them. We must really love them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And this is how we will know that we are true. This is why we will not be afraid in front of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Even if our hearts think we are wrong, God is greater than our hearts and he knows everything.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">My dear brothers, if our hearts do not think we are wrong, we will not be afraid in front of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">If we ask God for something, we get it. We get it because we obey his laws. We get it because we do what pleases him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">This is his law. We must believe in the name of his Son Jesus Christ. And we must love one another as he told us to do.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">If anyone obeys his laws, he belongs to God and God belongs to him. God has given us the Holy Spirit. That is how we know that God is with us.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="4">
      <VERS vnumber="1">My dear brothers, do not trust every spirit. But test the spirits to see if they belong to God. There are many prophets who are not true who have gone out into the world.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Here is how you can know the Spirit of God. Every spirit that believes that Jesus Christ has come in the body of a man is from God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And every spirit that does not say this about Jesus, does not belong to God. That is the spirit of the one who is against Christ. You have heard that he is coming. And now he is already in the world.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">My children, you belong to God. You have won the victory over those prophets who are not true. You have won because the Spirit that is in you is stronger than the spirit that is in the world.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Those prophets belong to the world. That is why they teach about things in the world.  And that is why the people of the world listen to them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But we belong to God. Anyone who knows God listens to us. Anyone who does not belong to God does not listen to us. This is how we know if a spirit is true or not true.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">My dear brothers, we must love one another, because love comes from God. Everyone who loves others is Gods child and he knows God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">But anyone who does not love others does not know God, because God is love.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">This is how God showed his love for us. He sent his only Son into the world to give us life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">This is love! We did not love God, but he loved us. And he sent his Son to be the sacrifice to pay for the wrong things we have done.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">My dear brothers, if God loved us so much, we must love one another also.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">No man has ever seen God. But God lives in us if we love one another. And in loving one another, his love is made perfect.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">He has given us of his own Spirit. That is how we know that we are in him and he is in us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And we have seen and we are telling you that the Father sent his Son to save the people in the world.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">If anyone says, Jesus is the Son of God, God is in him and he is in God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">We know and we believe that God loves us. God is love. And anyone who loves others is in God and God is in him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">That is why we love each other very much. Then we will not be afraid on the day when people are judged. We are like Christ in this world.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Where Gods love is, there is no fear. Gods perfect love takes away fear. It is punishment that makes a person fear. Anyone who has fear does not have perfect love.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">We love others because God first loved us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">If anyone says, I love God,and he hates his brother, he is telling a lie. If he does not love his brother whom he has seen, how can he love God whom he has not seen?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">God gave us this law. The person who loves God must love his brother also.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="5">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Everyone who believes that Jesus is the Christ is Gods child. And everyone who loves the Father loves his child.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">This is how we know we love Gods children. We love God and we obey his laws.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">We show that we love God when we obey his laws. His laws are not hard to obey.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Everyone who is Gods child wins a victory over the world. We win because we believe God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Who wins a victory over the world? It is only the person who believes that Jesus is the Son of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">There was water and there was blood when Jesus Christ came. There was not water only, but there was water and there was blood. The Spirit proves this is true, because the Spirit is true.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">There are three in heaven who prove it is true. They are the Father, the Word, and the Holy Spirit. These three are one.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">There are three on earth who prove it is true. They are the spirit, the water, and the blood. These three all prove the same thing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">We believe what people prove to us. But when God proves something it is stronger than what people prove. This is what God proved about his Son.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Anyone who believes in Gods Son believes what God says about him. Anyone who does not believe God shows that he thinks what God says is not true. He has not believed what God says about his Son.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Here is what God says. He has given us life that will last for ever. And this life is in his Son.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">So anyone who has the Son has this life. Anyone who does not have the Son of God does not have this life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">I have written these things to you who believe on the name of the Son of God. I have written them so that you will know that you will live for ever.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And we are sure God will do this. If we ask him for anything that he wants us to have, he will listen to us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And if we know he listens to us when we ask for anything, then we know that we have what we asked him for.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Maybe a man sees his brother do something wrong, but not so bad that he must die for it.  The man should ask God and God will let his brother live. God will let people live if the things they have done are not so bad that they must die for them. But there are things so wrong that a person must die for them. If he has done such as that, I do not tell the man to ask God to let him live.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Everything that is wrong is a bad thing. But not every bad thing is so wrong that a person must die for it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">We know that any child of God does not do wrong things. The Son of God keeps him safe and the devil cannot touch him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">We know that we belong to God and the whole world belongs to the devil.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">We know that the Son of God has come. He has given us a heart to know him who is true. We belong to him who is true, because we belong to his Son Jesus Christ. He is the true God. He has the life that will live for ever.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">My children, have nothing to do with false gods or idols.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">From the leader of the church people. I send greetings to the lady whom God has chosen,  and to her children. I love you all because you have the truth about Christ. I am not the only one who loves you. All those who know the truth, love you also.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">We love you because of the truth we share which is in our hearts and will be with us for ever.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">God the Father and Jesus Christ, the Fathers son, will bless us. They will be kind to us.  They will give us peace. They will do these things because they are true, and they love us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">I was very glad to find that some of your children are living in the right way. They are living the way the Father told us to live.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And now I want to ask you to do something. I am not telling you to do something new. It is the same law we had from the beginning. It is this, We must love one another.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">We love God when we live the way God has told us. This is the law you heard from the beginning. You must live by it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Many men who fool people have gone out into the world. They believe that Jesus Christ did not come to live as a man with a body. These men belong to the one who fools people. He is against Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Watch out for yourselves! Do not lose what you have worked for, but receive all the reward that you should have.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Everyone who goes too far, and does not believe what Christ taught, does not believe God. Anyone who believes what Christ taught, believes both the Father and the Son.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">If anyone comes to you who does not teach what Christ taught, do not take him into your house. Do not even greet him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Anyone who greets him helps him in the wrong things he does.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">I have much to write to you. But I do not want to write it on paper. I hope to come to visit you and talk with you. Then we will be very happy.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="2">My dear brother, I ask God that you may be all right in every way and that your body may be well. I know that your soul is all right.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">I was very happy when the brothers came and told me that you have been true. They said you are really living the right way.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Nothing can make me more happy than to hear that my children are living in the right way. My dear brother, when you help your Christian brothers in any way, even though you do not know them, you show that you do what you say you believe.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">They have told the people of the church here how you showed your love to them. Please send them on their way as God would have you do.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">They went out to do Christs work. And they have not taken any help from people who do not believe in God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">So we should help such men with what they need. Then we are doing our part to tell the true message. I wrote a letter to the people of the church. But Diotrephes wants to be the leader. He will not listen to us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">So if I come, I will show what he is doing. He is saying wrong things about us. And that is not all. He does not take our brothers into his own home. And he stops other people who want to take them in. He will not let them be church members any longer.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">My dear brother, do not do the wrong things people do, but do the good things people do.  Anyone who does good things belongs to God. Anyone who does wrong things has never seen God.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="2">May God be kind to you. May he give you peace. May he love you very much.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">My dear brothers, I wanted very much to write to you and tell you how we all are saved.  But then I saw that I must write and tell you to hold very strongly to what you do believe.  Fight against those who want to change it. The right way to believe has been given to Gods people once for all times.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Some men have come in quietly. They are bad men. The holy writings told us long ago that they would be punished. These men change the blessing of our God to do the wrong things they want to do. They show by their lives that they do not belong to Jesus Christ,  our only Master and Lord</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">You know all these things for all times. But I want to bring them to your minds. First, the Lord saved his people from the country of Egypt. At a time after that, he killed those who did not believe in him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Remember the angels also. Some of them did not keep the high place they had. But they left their home. God has them tied in chains for ever, and he is keeping them in a very dark place. He will keep them there until that big day when they will be judged.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Also Sodom and Gomorrah and the other cities near them show what will happen. The people there had wrong ways of using sex and did wrong things that people should not do with each other. They were punished and are in fire that burns for ever. God did this to show what will happen to others.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And yet these men do the same wrong things. They think of and do wrong things with their bodies. They will not obey the men who rule over them. And they say wrong things about those who are great, even about the angels.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">At one time Michael the chief angel had a quarrel with the devil about who should have the body of Moses. But he did not dare to judge the devil and say wrong things about him. He said, May the Lord tell you to stop!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">But these men say wrong things about everything they do not understand. They know some things just like animals that cannot think. And they will die because they do those wrong things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">They will have trouble! They have lived like Cain. They have done wrong things for pay like Balaam. They have talked against those who are over them. Korah did that. And so they will die as he did.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">These men spoil your love feasts. They are not afraid to eat and drink with you. They take care only of themselves. They are like clouds that do not give rain, and are blown around by the winds. They are like trees when their leaves are gone and they have no fruit. These trees are also dead because they have been pulled up by the roots.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">These men are like big waves on the sea. Big waves cause much trouble. And these men also show the wrong things they do. They are like stars that have fallen from their place in the sky. A very dark place has been kept for ever in which to put these men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Enoch was the seventh in Adams family line. He spoke words from God to these men also. He said, Listen! The Lord came with many thousands of his angels.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">He came to judge all people and to punish all the bad people for all the wrong things they have done. And he came to punish bad people for all the wrong things that they have said against him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">These men complain about the way things are. They do not like it. They do what they themselves want to do. They say big things. They say nice things to people to get what they want from them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">But, my dear brothers, you must remember what the apostles of the Lord Jesus Christ said would happen.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">They said to you, At the end of time, men will come who will make fun of holy things.  They will do the wrong things they themselves want to do.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">These are the men who make people go into different groups in the church meetings.  They have only a mans heart. They do not have the Holy Spirit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">But you, my dear brothers, must make your lives better in the holy things you believe.  Talk to God in the Holy Spirit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Keep yourselves in Gods love. Wait for our Lord Jesus Christ to come and help you. He will give you life that will live for ever.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Some people are not sure what they believe. Be kind to them by sharing in their troubles.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Pull them out of the fire and save them. There are other people to whom you must be kind, but be careful about it. But you must hate even the clothes that bad people have worn.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">God can keep you from doing anything wrong. He can bring you to the place where he is great and you will be all good. You will be very happy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">He is the only God. And he is our Saviour through our Lord Jesus Christ. He is great! He is wonderful! He has power! He has the right to rule! He was like that before time began!  He is like that now! And he will be like that for ever. Yes, he will!</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">God showed these things to Jesus Christ to show to his servants. These are things that must happen soon. Then God sent his angel and showed them to John, his servant.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">John wrote down what God said and what Jesus showed to him. These words tell all that He saw.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="4">Here is what John wrote to the people of the seven churches which are in the country of Asia Minor: May Gods loving kindness bless you and give you peace. He lives now, he always has lived, and he will come again. May the seven Spirits bless you and give you peace. They stand in front of Gods throne &lt;FI&gt;chief chair of a king&lt;Fi&gt; .</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">May Jesus Christ bless you and give you peace. What he says is true. He was the first to rise from death. And he is ruler of the kings of the earth. He loves us. By his own blood &lt;FI&gt;death&lt;Fi&gt; he has made us free from the wrong things we have done.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">He has made us into kings and priests to his God and Father. Praise him! He is great and has power for ever! Yes, it is so!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Watch! He will come in the clouds. Every one will see him. Those who stuck a spear in him will also see him. All the tribes on earth will cry when they see him. That is the way it will be. Yes it will!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">The Lord God says, I am the First and the Last. I am the beginning and the ending. I live now. I always have lived, and I will come again. I have all power.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">I am John, your brother. I belong to Jesus and I am having big trouble just as you are. I also belong to his kingdom and I wait patiently for it. I was on an island called Patmos because I told the word of God and talked about Jesus Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">I was in the Spirit on the Lords day. Behind me I heard a loud voice like the sound of a trumpet or horn.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">The voice said, Write what you see in a book. Send it to the seven churches in the cities of Ephesus, Smyrna, Pergamum, Thyatira, Sardis, Philadelphia, and Laodicea.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">I turned to see who was talking to me. I saw seven gold lamps.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">In the centre of the seven lamps I saw someone like the Son of Man. He was wearing a long gown with a wide, gold belt around his chest.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">The hair on his head was white like sheeps hair, white as snow. His eyes shone like a flame of fire.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">His feet shone like fine brass that has been made pure by fire. His voice was like the sound of much water flowing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">In his right hand he had seven stars. Out of his mouth came a long knife or sword, sharp on both sides. His face shone like the sun when it is shining very brightly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">When I saw him, I fell down in front of him as if I had died. He put his right hand on me and said, Do not be afraid. I am the First and the Last.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">I am he who lives. I died. But look, I am alive for ever. I have the keys to death and to the world of the dead.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="20">You saw seven stars in my right hand. I will tell you the secret meaning of them and of the seven gold lamps. The seven stars are the angels of the seven churches. The seven lamps are the seven churches.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="9">He says, "I know the things you do and the trouble you have. I know you are poor. But you are rich in some ways. I know some people do not respect God. They call themselves Jews. But they are not real Jews. They belong to Satans people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Do not be afraid of the troubles you will have. Yes, the devil will put some of you into prison where you will be tested. You will have trouble for ten days. But keep on believing, even if you have to die for it. I will give you life for ever."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">He who can hear should listen to the message of the Spirit to the churches. He says,  "The person who wins will not be hurt by the second death."</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="13">He says, "I know where you live. You live where Satan rules. But you keep my name and you have never said that you do not believe in me. You kept on believing in me even in the time of Antipas. He said he believed in me and was true to me. He was killed among you where Satan lives.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">But I have a few things to say against you. You have some people there who believe the teaching of Balaam. He showed Balak how to trick the people of Israel and make them do wrong. They ate food that was given to idols, and they used sex wrongly.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="2">Right away, I was in the Spirit. I saw a throne or chief chair in heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">The one who sat on the throne looked very fine and bright. He looked like fine stones called jasper and carnelian. All around his chair was a rainbow that looked like a fine stone called emerald.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Around his throne I saw twenty-four other thrones. On them sat twenty-four leaders.  They wore white clothes and had gold crowns on their heads.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">From the throne came lightning, loud noises, and thunder. In front of the throne, seven bright lamps were burning. These lamps are the seven Spirits of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">In front of the throne, it was like a sea of glass. It looked like a stone called crystal.  Around the throne on the four sides of it were four living beings. They had many eyes in their faces and in their back.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">The first living thing was like a lion. The second one was like a young cow. The third one had the face of a man. The fourth one was like a flying eagle.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="9">The living beings give praise and honour and thanks to the one who sits on the throne and lives for ever and ever.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="5">
      <VERS vnumber="1">I saw a book in the right hand of the one who sat on the chief chair. It had writing on the front and the back. It was locked with seven locks.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">I saw a strong angel calling with a loud voice. He said, Who can open the book and break its locks?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And no one in heaven or on earth or under the earth could open the book or look in it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">I cried very much because no one could open the book or look in it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Then one of the leaders said to me, Do not cry. See, the Lion of the tribe of Judah has won! The One who was born into Davids family has won! He can open the book and break its seven locks.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">I saw a Lamb standing in front of the throne and the four living beings, and in front of the leaders. It looked as if it had been killed. It had seven horns and seven eyes. They are the seven Spirits of God who are sent out all over the earth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">He went and took the book from the right hand of the One who sat on the throne.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And when he took the book, the four living beings and the twenty-four leaders kneeled down in front of the Lamb. Every one of them had a harp and a gold bowl. The bowls were full of incense that smelled very sweet when it was burned. These bowls are the words of Gods people when they talk to him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And the four living beings and the leaders sang a new song. The new song was: You are able to take the book and to open its locks, because you were killed. You have set the people free and bought them for God with the cost of your blood. They are from every tribe, language, nation, and country.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">You have made them into kings and priests for our God. They will rule on the earth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Then I saw and heard many angels. They were around the chair, and the living beings,  and the leaders. There were many, many thousands.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">They said with a loud voice, The Lamb of God who was killed is the only one good enough to be given power, riches, wisdom, strength, honour, praise, and blessing!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Then I heard everything in heaven, on earth, under the earth, and on the sea, and everything in them say, Blessing, honour, praise, and power belong for ever and ever to the One who sits on the throne, and to the Lamb!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Then the four living beings said, Amen! May it be so! And the leaders kneeled down and worshipped the One who lives for ever and ever.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="6">
      <VERS vnumber="1">I saw the Lamb open one of the seven locks. I heard the voice of one of the four living beings call, Come! It sounded like thunder.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And I looked and saw a white horse. The man who rode on it had a bow to shoot arrows.  A gold crown for his head was given to him. And he went out fighting to win the victory over his enemies.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">When the Lamb opened the second lock, I heard the second living being call, Come!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And another horse came out. It was red. The man who rode on it was allowed to take peace away from the earth, so that men would kill each other. The man who rode on it was given a long knife or sword.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">When the Lamb opened the third lock, I heard the third living being call, Come! I looked and saw a black horse. The man who rode on it had scales in his hand to weigh things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">I heard a voice among the four living beings. It said, Four cups of wheat for bread will sell for a days wages. Twelve cups of barley will sell for a days wages. But do not destroy the oil and the wine.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">When the Lamb opened the fourth lock, I heard the fourth living being call, Come!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">I saw a horse the colour of ashes. The name of the man who rode it was Death. And the one who controls the world of the dead followed him. They were given power over a fourth part of the world. They could kill people with a sword, or by making them go without food to eat, or by making them sick, or with wild animals.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">When the Lamb opened the fifth lock, I saw the souls of people who had been killed.  They were under the holy table where incense is burned. They had been killed because they believed Gods word and said they believed it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">They called in a loud voice, Lord, you are holy and true. How long will you wait before you judge and punish the people on earth because they killed us?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Then each one of them was given a white gown to wear. They were told to wait a little longer for the other Christian brothers. Those who worked with them for the Lord would be killed as they had been.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">I saw the Lamb opening the sixth lock. The earth shook very much. The sun became very dark, like the black cloth people wear to show they are sad. The full moon became red like blood.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">The stars in the sky fell to the earth. They fell like figs that are not ripe when the fig tree is shaken by a strong wind.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">The sky was taken away like paper being rolled up. Every big hill and island was shaken out of its place.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">The kings of the world, the great men, the army captains, the rich people, the strong people, every slave, and every freeman hid themselves in holes and the rocks on the big hills.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">They called to the hills and to the rocks and said, Fall on us! Hide us so the One on the throne will not see us. Hide us from the Lamb who is angry with us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">The great day has come, and he is very angry with us. Who can stand before him?</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="7">
      <VERS vnumber="1">After this, I saw four angels standing at four different places on the earth. They were holding back the winds coming from every way. They did this so that no wind would blow on the earth, or on the sea, or on any tree.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Then I saw another angel coming up from the place where the sun rises. He had something to put the mark of the living God on people. He called out in a loud voice to the four angels. They had been given power to hurt the earth and the sea.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">The angel said, Do not hurt the earth, the sea, or the trees until we have put a mark on the foreheads of Gods servants.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And I heard that one hundred and forty-four thousand people were marked. They were from every tribe of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Twelve thousand people were marked from each of these tribes: Judah, Reuben, Gad,  Asher, Naphtali, Manasseh, Simeon, Levi, Issachar, Zebulun, Joseph, Benjamin.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">After this, I looked and saw many people. There were so many that no person could count them all. They were from every country, tribe, nation, and language. I saw them standing in front of the throne and the Lamb. They wore white clothes and they had palm branches in their hands.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">They called in a loud voice and said, Our God who sits on the throne, and the Lamb:  they are the Ones who save people. Salvation belongs to them!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">All the angels were standing around the throne and around the leaders and the four living beings. They bowed down their faces in front of the throne and worshipped God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">They said, May it be so! Blessing, praise, glory and wisdom, thanks, honour, power, and strength belong to our God for ever and ever! Amen!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Then one of the leaders talked to me. He said, Who are these people wearing white clothes? Where did they come from?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Then I said to him, Sir, I do not know. And he said to me, These are the people who have had much trouble. They have washed their clothes in the blood of the Lamb and made them white.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">That is why they are in front of Gods throne. They worship him day and night in his temple. The one who sits on the throne will keep them safe because he is with them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">They will not be hungry or thirsty again. The sun or any other heat will not burn them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">The Lamb who is in front of the throne will take care of them. He will guide them to the places where there is water that gives life. And God will wipe every tear from their eyes.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="8">
      <VERS vnumber="1">When the Lamb opened the seventh lock, all was quiet in heaven for about a half hour.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Then I saw the seven angels stand in front of God. Seven horns or trumpets were given to them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Another angel came and stood at the altar. He had a gold bowl. Plenty of incense was given to him. He was to put it with all the words of all Gods people when they talk to him. He was to put it on the gold altar in front of Gods throne.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">The sweet smelling smoke of the burning incense went up at the same time as the prayer words of Gods people. They went up from the hand of the angel that was standing in front of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Then the angel took the bowl and filled it with fire from the altar. He threw it on the earth. There was thunder, loud noises, and lightning. And the earth shook.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">The seven angels who had the seven horns or trumpets got ready to blow them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">The first angel blew his trumpet. Rain like stones, and fire mixed with blood, fell on the earth. A third part of the earth was burned. A third of the trees was burned. And one third of all the green grass was burned.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">The second angel blew his trumpet. Then something like a big hill, burning with fire, was thrown into the sea.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Then a third of the sea became blood. A third of all things that lived in the sea died. A third of all the boats was broken.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">The third angel blew his trumpet. A big star fell from the sky. It burned and gave a bright light. It fell on a third of the rivers and places where there is water.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">The name of the star is Bitter. A third part of the water became bitter. Many men died because the water was made bad to drink.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">The fourth angel blew his trumpet. A third of the sun was made dark. And a third of the moon and a third of the stars were made dark. A third part of them became dark. A third part of the day had no light, and also a third part of the night.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Then I looked and heard an angel who was flying across the sky. He called in a loud voice and said, Trouble! Trouble! Trouble to the people who live on earth! Big trouble will come when the sound of the other trumpets is heard. The three angels are now ready to blow their trumpets!</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="9">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Then the fifth angel blew his trumpet. I saw a star that had fallen from the sky to the earth. The key to the big hole that has no bottom was given to the angel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">He opened the big hole and smoke came out. It was like the smoke of a very big fire. The sun and the air were made dark by the smoke from the big hole.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Then out of the smoke came locusts on the earth like big grasshoppers. They were given the power to hurt people the way that scorpions do.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">They were told not to spoil any of the grass, nor any green plant, nor any tree on earth.  They were told to hurt only the people who did not have Gods mark on their foreheads.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">They were told not to kill them, but to trouble them for five months. The pain they give is like the pain a scorpion gives when it strikes a person.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">In those days people will look for death, but they will not be able to find it. They will want to die, but death will fly away from them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">The locusts looked like horses ready to go to war. On their heads were gold crowns. And they had faces like people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Their hair was like womens hair and their teeth like lions teeth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Their bodies were covered by something like pieces of iron. The noise of their wings sounded like many wagons and horses running to war.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">The locusts had tails like scorpions that could strike people and hurt them for five months.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">The king of the locusts is the angel of the big hole that has no bottom. His name is Abaddon in the Jews language and Apollyon in the Greek language. (This means, the one who destroys.)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">The first trouble is gone. Two more troubles are coming after it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">The sixth angel blew his trumpet. I heard a voice from the four horns of the gold altar in front of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">The voice said to the sixth angel who had the trumpet, Untie the four angels who are tied at the big river Euphrates.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">So the four angels were let free. They were ready for the hour, the day, the month, and the year when they would kill a third of the people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">In their army were many, many thousands of men on horses. I heard the number of them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">I saw what the horses and the men that sat on them looked like. The bodies of the men were covered by pieces of iron that looked red like fire and blue, and yellow. The heads of the horses were like lions heads. Fire, smoke and dust came out of their mouths. The dust was sulphur which choked and killed people when it burned in the fire.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">By these three big troubles a third part of the people were killed. They were killed by the fire, smoke, and choking sulphur dust that came out of the mouths of the horses.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">The power of the horses is in their mouths and in their tails. Their tails have heads and are like snakes. They hurt people with them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">The other people were not killed by these big troubles. But they did not stop worshipping what they had made with their hands. They did not stop worshipping bad spirits and idols made of gold, silver, brass, stone, and wood. These idols cannot see or hear or walk.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And they did not stop their killing, or their witchcraft, or their wrong ways of using sex,  or their stealing.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="10">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Then I saw another strong angel coming down from the sky. A cloud was around him and a rainbow was over his head. His face was like the sun and his legs were like posts of fire.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">In his hand he had a small book that was open. He put his right foot on the sea, and his left foot on the land.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">He called in a very loud voice like a lion roaring. When he called, it was like the voices of seven thunders.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">When the seven thunders had spoken, I was going to write down what they said. But I heard a voice from the sky that said, Do not tell what the seven thunders said. Do not write it down.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">The angel that I saw standing on the sea and on the land raised his right hand toward the sky.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">He made a promise in the name of the one who lives for ever and ever. He made it in the name of the one who made the sky and everything in it, who made the earth and everything in it, and the sea and everything in it. He said, There is no more time.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">But when the seventh angel calls by blowing his trumpet, then the secret plan of God will be finished. It will happen just as God told his servants, the prophets.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">The voice I heard in the sky talked to me again. It said, Go to the angel who is standing on the sea and on the land. Take the open book from his hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">So I went to the angel and asked him to give me the little book. He said to me, Take it and eat it. It will be bitter inside you, but it will be sweet like honey in your mouth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">So I took the little book from the angels hand and ate it. It was sweet like honey in my mouth. But when I had eaten it, my belly was bitter.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Then he said to me, You must tell again what God is saying to many nations, countries,  languages, and kings.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="11">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Then I was given a long stick. And he said, Go and measure Gods temple and the altar,  and count the people who worship there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Do not measure the part outside the temple. Leave it out, because it has been given to the people who do not believe in God. They will walk in the holy city for forty-two months.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">I will give power to the two men who speak for me. They will speak words from God.  They will continue to speak for forty-two months. They will wear clothes like people wear to show they are sad.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">These two men are the two olive trees and the two lamps which stand in front of the Lord of the earth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">If any one wants to hurt them, fire comes out of their mouths and burns up their enemies.  If anyone wants to hurt them, he must be killed in this way.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">These two men can stop the sky from raining all the days that they speak words from God. And they can turn the water into blood. They can bring all kinds of trouble to the earth as often as they want.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">There is a beast which is a wild animal in the big hole that has no bottom. When the two men have finished talking, the beast will come up out of the hole. It will fight with the men. It will win over them and kill them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Their dead bodies will lie in the street of the big city. This city is called, Sodom and Egypt, because it is like them. Also it is where our Lord was nailed to a cross.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">People from many nations, tribes, languages, and countries will look at their dead bodies for three and a half days. They will not let anyone bury them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">The people on earth will be very glad to see them dead. They will have a happy time.  They will give gifts to each other because these two men from God had troubled the people on the earth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">But after the three and a half days, life came into them. They stood on their feet. And all those who saw them were very much afraid.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Then they heard a loud voice from the sky saying to them, Come up here! They went up into the sky in a cloud. And the men who hated them saw them go up.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">At that time, the earth shook very much. A tenth part of the city fell down. Seven thousand people were killed by the shaking of the earth. The other people were very much afraid and they give glory to God in heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">The second trouble is gone. The third trouble is coming soon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Then the seventh angel blew his trumpet. Loud voices were heard in the sky. They said,  The kingdom of the world now belongs to our Lord and to his Christ. He will rule for ever and ever.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Then the twenty-four leaders who sat on their thrones in front of God kneeled down and worshipped God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">They said, We thank you, Lord God, who has all power. You live now and you always have lived. We thank you because you have now used your power and started to rule.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">The people who did not believe you became angry. But now you are angry. It is time for dead people to be judged. And it is time to reward your servants, the prophets of God,  and your holy people and all who respect your name-those who are great and those who are not so great. It is time to destroy those who destroy the earth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Then the temple of God in heaven was opened. The box where his agreement was kept was seen inside the temple. And there was lightning, loud noises, and thunder. The earth shook and much rain, like stones, fell.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="12">
      <VERS vnumber="1">I saw a wonderful thing in the sky. A woman was wearing the sun like a dress. She stood on the moon. On her head she had twelve stars in a big ring like a crown. She was going to have a baby.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">She cried out in pain because it was time for the baby to be born.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And another wonderful thing was seen in the sky. It was a big red dragon. He had seven heads and ten horns. He had seven big rings on his heads.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">His tail struck a third part of the stars from the sky to the earth. The dragon stood in front of the woman who would soon have a baby. He wanted to eat her baby when it was born.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Then her baby boy was born. He will rule all the countries with an iron stick. Her child was taken up to God, to Gods throne.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">The woman ran away into the wilderness. There God had made a place ready for her.  There she will have food for forty-two months.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Then there was fighting in heaven. Michael and his angels fought with the dragon. The dragon and his angels fought back.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">But they did not win the fight and no longer were they allowed to stay in heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">The dragon was thrown down. He was that old snake who is called the devil and Satan.  He fools all the people in the world. He was thrown down to earth and his angels were thrown down with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">I heard a loud voice in the sky. It said, Now the time has come for God to save people.  He will use his strength. His kingdom will come and his Christ will use his power. The one who says bad things about our brothers to God day and night has been thrown down.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">They have won the fight against him by the blood of the Lambs death, and by what they said. They did not try to save their lives, but were willing to die.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Heaven, and those who live in heaven, be glad because of it! Big trouble will come to the earth and sea! The devil has come down to you. He is very angry. He knows that he has only a short time!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And when the dragon saw that he had been thrown down to earth, he troubled the woman to whom a baby boy had been born.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">But the woman was given two wings like a big eagles wings. With them she could fly away from the dragon into the wilderness to her place where she would have food for three and a half periods of time.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">The dragon poured water like a river out of his mouth after her. He wanted the water to carry her away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">But the earth helped the woman. It opened a big hole. And the river which the dragon had poured out of his mouth went down the hole.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Then the dragon was very angry with the woman. He went away to fight against the other children of the woman. They are the ones who keep the laws of God and tell the truth about Jesus.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="13">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Then I stood on the sand by the sea. I saw a wild animal come up out of the sea. The beast had seven heads and ten horns. On its horns were ten big crowns. On its heads it had names that did not respect God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">The beast I saw was like a leopard. It had feet like a bear and a mouth like a lion. The dragon gave it his own strength, his own throne, and great power.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">One of its heads had a cut, bad enough to kill it. But the bad cut was healed. All the people on earth were much surprised and followed the beast.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">They worshipped the dragon because he had given this power to the beast. And they worshipped the beast too. They said, Who is like this beast? Who can fight against it?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">The beast was given a mouth that spoke proud words against God. It was given power to rule for forty-two months.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">It opened its mouth to speak against God, to speak against his name and the place where he lives, and to speak against those who live in heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">It was also given power to fight against Gods people and to win the fight against them. It was given power to rule over every tribe, nation, language, and country.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Everyone on earth will worship the beast, if they do not have their names in the book of life. The book of life belongs to the Lamb who was killed. That was Gods plan since the world was made.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">He who can hear should listen:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Anyone who puts people in prison will go to prison. Any one who kills others with a long knife or sword will be killed by a long knife or sword. This is why Gods people are patient and keep on believing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Then I saw another beast come up out of the earth. It had two horns like a lamb but talked like a dragon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">It uses all the power of the first beast and stands with it. It makes all the earth and those who live on it worship the first beast. That was the beast whose bad cut was healed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">The second beast does wonderful things. It even makes fire fall from the sky to the earth for everyone to see.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">It fools the people who live on earth by the wonderful things which it has been given power to do, while the first beast looks on. It tells the people on earth to make an idol like the first beast that was cut by the big knife but lived.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">It was given power to make the idol of the beast live. The idol of the beast could speak and command all those who would not worship the idol to be killed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">It makes all the people take a mark on their right hands or on their foreheads. That means all people, those who are great and those who are not great, the poor, free men, and slaves.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">No one could buy or sell anything if he did not have this mark. This mark is the name of the beast or the number of its name.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Here wisdom is needed. If a person understands, he should count the number of the beast. It is the number of a mans name. Its number is six hundred and sixty-six.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="14">
      <VERS vnumber="1">The song of the 144,000 Then I looked and saw the Lamb standing on a hill called Zion.  With him were one hundred and forty-four thousand people. They had his name and the name of his Father written on their foreheads.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">I heard a sound from the sky like the sound of much water flowing, and like the sound of much thunder. The sound I heard was like people playing music on their harps.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">They were singing a new song in front of Gods chief chair, in front of the four living beings and the leaders. No one could learn that song but the one hundred and forty-four thousand people. They have been bought from the earth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">They are the people who have not had sex with women. They are clean. They are the people who follow the Lamb wherever he goes. They lived among people on earth. They have been bought from the earth. They are the first among men to have been bought for God and the Lamb.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">They never told lies. They are found to be without any wrong ways as they stand before the throne of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Then I saw another angel flying across the sky. He had good news that will last for ever to tell the people who live on the earth. The good news is for every country, tribe,  language, and nation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">He said in a loud voice, Respect and honour God and give him glory! The time has come for him to judge people, to tell them how good or bad they are. Worship him. He made heaven and earth, the sea, and the rivers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">A second angel followed him. He said, The great city of Babylon has fallen down. It has fallen down because it filled all the countries with its wrong ways. It has made people to suffer Gods anger.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">A third angel followed the other two. He said in a loud voice, Any person who worships the beast or its idol, and takes its mark on his forehead or on his hand, will also feel Gods anger. He is very angry. That person will be burned with fire and dust that chokes people when it burns. He will be burned in front of the holy angels and the Lamb.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">The smoke of that fire goes up for ever and ever. Those who worship the animal and its idol, and anyone who takes the mark of its name, will get no rest day or night.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">This is why Gods people must be patient. They are the ones who keep the laws of God and believe in Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">I heard a voice from the sky. It said, Write this: From now on, happy are those who die believing in the Lord. Yes, says the Spirit. They will have rest from their troubles. The good things they have done will go with them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">I looked and saw a white cloud. I saw someone like the Son of Man sitting on the cloud.  He had a big gold crown on his head and a sharp harvest knife in his hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Another angel came out of Gods temple. He called in a loud voice to the one who was sitting on the cloud. He said, Take your knife and cut the harvest. The time has come to take in the harvest because the earth is ready.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">So the one who sat on the cloud used his knife on earth. And the harvest on earth was cut.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Then another angel came out of the temple in heaven. He also had a sharp knife.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And another angel came from the altar. He had power over fire. He called in a loud voice to the angel who had the sharp knife. He said, Take your sharp knife and gather the fruit that grows on the vine on the earth. Its fruit is ripe.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">So the angel used his knife on earth. He gathered the fruit of the vine on the earth. He put it in the big place where the water of the fruit is pressed out. This place is Gods anger.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">It was outside the city that they pressed the fruit. Blood ran out of the place. It came up as high as the horses heads for about two hundred miles.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="15">
      <VERS vnumber="1">I saw another big and wonderful thing in the sky. I saw seven angels who carried the seven big troubles. They are the last troubles. When these troubles have come, Gods anger is ended. 2I saw something that looked like a sea of glass mixed with fire. And I saw those people who had won the fight against the beast, and its idol, and its mark, and the number of its name. They were standing on the sea of glass and they had the harps of God in their hands.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">They sing the song of Moses who is the servant of God, and the song of the Lamb. They say, Lord God who has all power, the things you do are great and wonderful! King for ever, your ways are right and true!</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="4">After this I looked. The temple in heaven was open. It was the place where Gods agreement was kept.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">The seven angels who carried the seven troubles came out of the temple. They were wearing linen clothes, clean and shining. Around their chests they wore gold belts.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">One of the four living beings gave the angels seven gold bowls. The bowls were full of the anger of God who lives for ever and ever.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">The temple was full of smoke because God is so great and has so much power. No one could go into the temple until the seven troubles, which the seven angels had, were ended.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="16">
      <VERS vnumber="1">I heard a loud voice coming from the temple. It said to the seven angels, Go and pour the seven bowls of Gods anger on the earth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">So the first angel went and poured his bowl on the earth. Then a bad, dirty sore came on the people who had the mark of the animal on them, and who worshipped its idol.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">The second angel poured his bowl on the sea. It turned into blood like that of a person who has been killed. Everything in the sea that had life died.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">The third angel poured his bowl on the rivers and the places where there was water.  They turned into blood.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And I heard the angel of the water say, Holy One, you who live now and who always have lived, and will live for ever; you are right because you have punished them this way.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">They killed Gods people and the prophets. Now you have given them blood to drink. This is what they should get!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">I heard the people under the altar say, Yes, Lord God, you have all power! The way you punish is true and right!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">The fourth angel poured his bowl on the sun. Then the sun was given the power to burn people with fire.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">People were burned because the sun was so hot. And they spoke wrongly about the name of God, cursing him because he had the power to send these troubles. But they would not stop the wrong things they were doing. They would not respect and honour God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">The fifth angel poured his bowl on the throne of the beast. The place where he ruled became dark. People bit their tongues because of the pain they had.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">They cursed God in heaven because of their pain and sores. But they did not stop the wrong things they were doing. They would not turn back to God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">The sixth angel poured his bowl on the big river Euphrates. Its water dried up so that a road was made ready for the kings to come from the east.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">I saw three bad spirits like frogs come out of the mouth of the dragon, and out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the mouth of the prophet who is not true.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">They are the spirits of gods who are not true, and they do wonderful things. They go to the kings of the whole world and gather them to fight on the great day of God who has all power.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="16">They gathered at the place called Armageddon in the Hebrew language.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Then the seventh angel poured his bowl into the air. A loud voice came from the temple and the chair. It said, It is finished!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">There were lightnings, loud noises, and thunder. The earth shook very much. It shook more than it had ever shaken since people have been on earth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">The big city was broken into three parts. And the cities of the nations fell down. God remembered Babylon, the big city. He made it feel all of his great anger.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">The islands all went away, and the mountains could not be seen.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Rain like big stones fell from the sky on men. Each stone weighed about a hundred pounds. Men cursed God because the big rain of stones fell on them. The trouble was very bad.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="17">
      <VERS vnumber="1">One of the seven angels who had carried the seven bowls came and talked to me. He said, Come, and I will show you the woman who has given herself over to wrong ways of using sex. She is sitting over many waters. I will show you how she will be punished.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">The kings on earth have been with her and copied her. And the people on earth gladly copy her wrong ways.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Then the angel took me away in the Spirit to a wilderness. There I saw a woman sitting on a red beast that had names against God written all over it. It had seven heads and ten horns.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">The woman was wearing blue and red clothes. She was shining with gold, fine stones,  and pearls. In her hand she held a gold cup. It was full of the wrong things she did and of her dirty ways of using sex.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">A name was written on her forehead. It has a secret meaning. The name is Great Babylon, the mother of all people who give their bodies for wrong ways of using sex. The mother of all things done on earth too bad to talk about.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And I saw the woman was drunk because of the blood she drank. It was the blood of Gods people, and the blood of people who had been killed because they belonged to Jesus. When I saw her, I was very much surprised.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">The angel asked me, Why are you surprised? I will tell you the secret meaning of the woman and the beast with seven heads and horns that carries her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">The beast that you saw was alive at one time, then it was dead. It will come up from the big hole that has no bottom and it will be killed. The people on earth will be surprised when they see the beast, because it was alive and then it was dead, and it comes alive again. These are the people who do not have their names written in the book of life from the time the world was made.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">To understand this, one must be wise. The seven heads are the seven hills on which the woman is sitting.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">They are also seven kings. Five have already lost their power. One is ruling now, and the other one has not yet come. When he comes he will rule for a short time.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">The beast that was alive at the one time, and then was dead, is the eighth king. He is really one of the seven. He will be killed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">The ten horns that you saw are ten kings who have not yet ruled. They will have power for one hour to rule with the animal.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">These ten all think the same way, and they give to the beast their power and right to rule.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">They will fight against the Lamb, but the Lamb will win the fight against them. He will win because he is Lord of lords and King of kings. Those who are with the Lamb will also win. God has called them and chosen them, and they believe in him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And the angel said to me, You saw the water on which the bad woman is sitting. The water is the many nations, many people, many countries, and many languages.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">You saw the ten horns and the animal. They will hate the bad woman. They will take away everything she has and her fine clothes. They will eat her body and burn her up in a fire.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">God has put it into their hearts to do what he wants done to her. They will all agree. They will give to the beast their power to rule until what God has said comes true.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">The woman whom you saw is the big city that rules over the kings on earth.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="18">
      <VERS vnumber="1">After that I saw another angel coming down from the sky. He had much power. The bright light that shone from him lit up the earth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">He called in a loud voice and said, The big city of Babylon has fallen down! It has fallen down! Bad spirits live in it. All bad spirits hide there. And all kinds of dirty birds that people hate hide there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">All the nations are broken down because they are full of its wrong ways. The kings of the earth have joined with it. The traders of the earth have become rich because of its wrong ways.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Then I heard another voice from the sky that said, Come out of it, my people, so that you will have no part in the wrong things it does. Come out of it so that you will not have the big troubles it will have.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Its wrong ways are piled as high as the sky and God has remembered the wrong things it has done.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Do to it what it did to you. Yes, do two times as much to it as it did to you! From the cup it gave you to drink, give it two times as much to drink as it gave to you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">It is proud of itself and has done wrong things. Give it that much trouble and crying. It says in its heart, "I am like a queen. I am not like a woman who has lost her husband. I will never know sorrow."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">So then, its big troubles will come in one day. Those troubles are death, crying, hunger,  and being burned in a fire. The Lord who has punished it is strong.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And the kings of the earth were joined with it in its wrong ways. They will cry and be sad about it when they see the smoke while it burns.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">They will stand far away from it because they are afraid of the trouble it is having. They will say, "Trouble! Trouble! You big, strong city Babylon! In one hour your punishment has come!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And the traders of the earth will cry and be sad about it, because no one buys the things they bring to sell.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">They have many things to sell: gold, silver, fine stones, and pearls. They have linen clothes and blue cloth, silk cloth and red cloth. They have all kinds of sweet smelling wood. They have all kinds of things made of ivory. They have all kinds of things made of wood that costs much money, of brass, of iron, and of a stone called marble.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">They have spices and perfume. They have incense and a sweet-smelling oil. They have frankincense and wine and oil. They have fine flour and wheat. They have cows, sheep,  horses, and wagons. They have slaves and people to sell.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">The things that your heart wanted are gone from you. All your fine food and clothes are gone from you. You will never find them again.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">The traders will sell these things and got much money from the city. They will stand far away from it because they are afraid of the trouble it is having. They will cry and be sad about it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">They will say "How terrible for you, you big strong city! You were wearing linen clothes and purple and red clothes. You were shining with gold, fine stones, and pearls.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">In one hour all your great riches are lost." And all the captains of the boats and all the seamen, the sailors, and all that do business on the sea stood away from it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">They called out loud when they saw the smoke while it burned. They said, "What city is like that big city?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">They threw dust on their heads and they called out loud. They cried and were sad. They said, "How terrible for that big city! All the men who had boats on the sea became rich because it was rich. In one hour it is all lost."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Be glad for what has happened to it, all you who are in heaven, Gods people, apostles and prophets. God has punished it for what it did to you!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Then a strong angel took up a very heavy stone and threw it into the sea. He said, So hard will Babylon the big city be thrown down. It will not be seen again.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">People will not hear music in you again. No harps, no singing, no pipes or horns will ever be heard in you again. No one will make things in you again. The noise of people grinding grain will not be heard in you again.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">No lamp will shine in you again. No one will hear the voice of people being married.  Your traders were the big people of the world. All the countries were fooled by your witch doctors.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">After this I heard a loud sound in heaven. It sounded like many people calling. They said,  Praise our God! He saves people. He is great and power belongs to him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">The way God punishes is true and right. He has punished the bad woman who spoiled the earth with her wrong ways. He has made her pay for the killing of his servants.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">They said again, Praise God! The smoke where she burns goes up for ever and ever!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Then the twenty-four leaders and the four living beings kneeled down. They worshipped God who was sitting on his throne, and they said, Amen! Yes, it is so! Praise God!</VERS>
