The Common Edition: New Testament
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  The Common Edition is the result of a decade long study of the New Testament
  and numerous English translations in the modern church. The goals for this
  edition are:

        1.  To be accurate to the Greek Scriptures and yet highly readable, 

        2.  To balance traditional wording with modern English, and

        3.  To reflect the standard Christian understanding and wording of the
            New Testament.

  The purpose of these goals is to create a standardized New Testament for the
  modern English reader.

  There are two ways to create a standardized text. [The first way] is to
  create a text of such surpassing scholarship and expression that it
  practically eliminates the use of other editions for decades or perhaps
  centuries. [The second way] is to isolate what the most widely used
  editions have in common, eliminate what they do not have in common, and
  place the results in a single text.

  
  The King James Version succeeded in both of these two ways.

  Over the past hundred years there have been numerous attempts to create a
  new English standard Bible. Each of these attempts has sought to produce a
  standardized edition in the first way I have described. The Common Edition
  New Testament follows the second method.

  A standardized edition of any work seeks a balance between extremes. The
  most literally accurate version may not be the easiest to read. The most
  traditionally worded may not be very modern.

  It cannot have a target audience; what is best for preachers and theologians
  may not be best for the daily devotional reader.

  Finally, a standardized edition cannot be innovative. One reviewer gave me
  the highest compliment I could receive when he said, "there's nothing new
  about it!"

  I hope that readers will find in these pages exactly what they would expect
  from a standardized edition, and that no matter what versions they have used
  in the past, they will find something familiar here.

   
  This initial release into the public domain is intended for free
  distribution. The text itself is copyrighted, with the following provisions:

        1.  The Common Edition: New Testament may be copied and distributed in
            electronic or printed form for free.

        2.  It may be bound or downloaded for personal use or for a gift.

        3.  It may not be sold by anyone other than the editor. 

        4.  The text may not be altered.

        5.  No more than 10,000 words may be included in a document published
            for sale without the express written permission of the editor.

        6.  No more than 20% of a document published for sale may be quoted
            from this edition without the express written permission of the
            editor. 

        7.  All distributions of the Common Edition, and all documents which
            quote the Common Edition, must contain the following copyright
            notice: Common Edition New Testament, Copyright © Timothy E.
            Clontz 1999. All rights reserved.

  If you find a phrase or word which is unclear, or which you believe needs
  review, please email the editor at {teclontz@aol.com}.

   
  Although it is not appropriate to dedicate a New Testament to any
  individual, the editor would like to give his gratitude to the many people
  who have labored to preserve this text. Those who penned the autographs
  often faced ridicule or death. Nameless monks sleep in the dust, who
  faithfully copied one manuscript to another down through the centuries. By
  the time of the Reformation, William Tyndale had one wish: to make the
  Christian Bible available in English to the poorest farmhand in England. For
  this crime he was strangled and burned at the stake.

  And then there are those who have simply loved these words enough to live by
  their highest ideals. Without the goodness of their lives no one would
  believe there to be anything Holy about a Bible. One such godly man was M.
  D. Barefield, who learned to read as an adult just so that he could make
  this word his own. My grandfather, Bill Clontz, who will always be an
  example for my family, gradually bought larger and larger print Bibles and
  finally began using the Bible on tape - just to keep the Word fresh in his
  heart. Such people always stay fresh in the hearts of those who have known
  them, and their love for God is contagious.

      <VERS vnumber="1">The book of the genealogy of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Abraham was the father of Isaac, Isaac the father of Jacob, and Jacob the father of Judah and his brothers,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">and Judah the father of Perez and Zerah by Tamar, Perez the father of Hezron, and Hezron the father of Ram,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Ram the father of Amminadab, Amminadab the father of Nahshon, and Nahshon the father of Salmon,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Salmon the father of Boaz by Rahab, Boaz the father of Obed by Ruth, and Obed the father of Jesse,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">and Jesse the father of King David. <STYLE css="display:block;text-indent:5mm">David was the father of Solomon by the wife of Uriah,</STYLE></VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Solomon the father of Rehoboam, Rehoboam the father of Abijah, and Abijah the father of Asa,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Asa the father of Jehoshaphat, Jehoshaphat the father of Joram, and Joram the father of Uzziah,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Uzziah the father of Jotham, Jotham the father of Ahaz, and Ahaz the father of Hezekiah,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Hezekiah the father of Manasseh, Manasseh the father of Amon, and Amon the father of Josiah,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">and Josiah the father of Jeconiah and his brothers at the time of the exile to Babylon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And after the exile to Babylon: Jeconiah was the father of Shealtiel, and Shealtiel the father of Zerubbabel,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Zerubbabel the father of Abiud, Abiud the father of Eliakim, and Eliakim the father of Azor,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Azor the father of Zadok, Zadok the father of Achim, and Achim the father of Eliud,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Eliud the father of Eleazar, Eleazar the father of Matthan, and Matthan the father of Jacob,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">and Jacob the father of Joseph the husband of Mary, of whom Jesus was born, who is called Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">So all the generations from Abraham to David were fourteen generations, and from David to the exile to Babylon fourteen generations, and from the exile to Babylon to the Christ fourteen generations.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Now the birth of Jesus Christ took place in this way: when his mother Mary was betrothed to Joseph, before they came together, she was found to be with child of the Holy Spirit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Then Joseph her husband, being a just man, and not wanting to put her to public shame, was resolved to divorce her quietly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">But as he considered this, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, »Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary your wife, for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Spirit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And she will give birth to a son, and you shall call his name Jesus, for he will save his people from their sins.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">All this took place to fulfill what the Lord had spoken by the prophet:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">
        <STYLE css="display:block;text-indent:5mm">»Behold, the virgin shall be with child and bear a son,</STYLE>
        <STYLE css="display:block;text-indent:10mm">and they shall call his name Immanuel,«</STYLE>
        <STYLE css="display:block;text-indent:5mm">which means, »God with us.«</STYLE>
      </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">When Joseph woke from sleep, he did as the angel of the Lord commanded him and took his wife,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">but did not know her until she had borne a son. And he called his name Jesus.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="2">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now after Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod the king, behold, wise men from the East came to Jerusalem,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">saying, »Where is he who has been born king of the Jews? For we have seen his star in the East and have come to worship him.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">When Herod the king heard this, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And when he had gathered all the chief priests and scribes of the people together, he inquired of them where the Christ was to be born.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">So they said to him, »In Bethlehem of Judea, for thus it is written by the prophet:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">
        <STYLE css="display:block;text-indent:5mm">But you, Bethlehem, in the land of Judah,</STYLE>
        <STYLE css="display:block;text-indent:10mm">are by no means least among the rulers of Judah;</STYLE>
        <STYLE css="display:block;text-indent:5mm">for out of you shall come a ruler</STYLE>
        <STYLE css="display:block;text-indent:10mm">who will be the shepherd of my people Israel.«</STYLE>
      </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Then Herod called the wise men secretly and determined from them what time the star had appeared.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And he sent them to Bethlehem and said, »Go and search diligently for the young child, and when you have found him, bring back word to me, so that I too may come and worship him.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">When they had heard the king they went their way; and behold, the star which they had seen in the East went before them, until it came to rest over the place where the child was.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">When they saw the star, they rejoiced with exceedingly great joy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">On coming into the house, they saw the child with his mother Mary, and they fell down and worshipped him. Then they opened their treasures and presented him with gifts of gold, and of frankincense, and of myrrh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And being warned in a dream not to return to Herod, they departed to their own country by another way.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Now when they had departed, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream and said, »Rise, take the child and his mother, and flee to Egypt, and stay there until I tell you; for Herod is about to search for the child, to destroy him.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">When he rose, he took the young child and his mother by night and departed for Egypt,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">and remained there until the death of Herod. And so was fulfilled what the Lord had spoken by the prophet, »Out of Egypt have I called my son.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Then Herod, when he saw that he had been tricked by the wise men, was in a furious rage, and he sent and killed all the male children in Bethlehem and in all its region who were two years old or under, according to the time which he had determined from the wise men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Then was fulfilled what was spoken by the prophet Jeremiah:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">
        <STYLE css="display:block;text-indent:5mm">»A voice was heard in Ramah,</STYLE>
        <STYLE css="display:block;text-indent:10mm">lamentation, weeping, and great mourning,</STYLE>
        <STYLE css="display:block;text-indent:5mm">Rachel weeping for her children,</STYLE>
        <STYLE css="display:block;text-indent:10mm">refusing to be comforted, because they are no more.«</STYLE>
      </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">But when Herod died, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">saying, »Rise, take the young child and his mother, and go to the land of Israel, for those who sought the young childs life are dead.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And he rose and took the child and his mother, and went to the land of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">But when he heard that Archelaus was reigning over Judea in place of his father Herod, he was afraid to go there. And being warned in a dream, he withdrew to the district of Galilee,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">and he went and dwelt in a city called Nazareth, that what was spoken by the Prophets might be fulfilled, »He shall be called a Nazarene.«</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="3">
      <VERS vnumber="1">In those days John the Baptist came, preaching in the wilderness of Judea,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">and saying, »Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">For this is he who was spoken of by the prophet Isaiah when he said, <STYLE css="display:block;text-indent:5mm">»The voice of one crying in the wilderness:</STYLE><STYLE css="display:block;text-indent:10mm">Prepare the way of the Lord,</STYLE><STYLE css="display:block;text-indent:5mm">make his paths straight.«</STYLE></VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Now John wore a garment of camels hair, and a leather belt around his waist; and his food was locusts and wild honey.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Then Jerusalem and all Judea and all the region about the Jordan went out to him,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">and confessing their sins, they were baptized by him in the Jordan River.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming for baptism, he said to them, »You brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the wrath to come?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Bear fruit worthy of repentance,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">and do not think to say to yourselves, We have Abraham as our father. For I tell you that God is able to raise up children to Abraham from these stones.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Even now the ax is laid at the root of the trees, and every tree therefore that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">I baptize you with water for repentance, but he who is coming after me is mightier than I, whose sandals I am not worthy to carry. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">His winnowing fork is in his hand, and he will clear his threshing floor and gather his wheat into the barn, but the chaff he will burn up with unquenchable fire.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Then Jesus came from Galilee to John at the Jordan to be baptized by him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">But John tried to prevent him, saying, »I need to be baptized by you, and do you come to me?«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">But Jesus answered him, »Let it be so now; for thus it is fitting for us to fulfill all righteousness.« Then he consented.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And when Jesus was baptized, he went up immediately from the water, and behold, the heavens were opened and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove, and alighting on him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And behold, a voice from heaven, saying, »This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased.«</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="4">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Then Jesus was led up by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And he fasted forty days and forty nights, and afterward he was hungry.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And the tempter came and said to him, »If you are the Son of God, command these stones to become loaves of bread.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">But he answered, »It is written, <STYLE css="display:block;text-indent:5mm">Man shall not live by bread alone,</STYLE><STYLE css="display:block;text-indent:10mm">but by every word that proceeds</STYLE><STYLE css="display:block;text-indent:15mm">from the mouth of God.«</STYLE></VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Then the devil took him to the holy city, and set him on the pinnacle of the temple,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">and said to him, »If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down. For it is written, <STYLE css="display:block;text-indent:5mm">He will give his angels charge of you,</STYLE><STYLE css="display:block;text-indent:10mm">and In their hands they will bear you up,</STYLE><STYLE css="display:block;text-indent:5mm">lest you strike your foot against a stone.«</STYLE></VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Jesus said to him, »Again it is written, You shall not tempt the Lord your God.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Again, the devil took him to a very high mountain, and showed him all the kingdoms of the world, and their glory.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And he said to him, »All these I will give you, if you will fall down and worship me.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Then Jesus said to him, »Away, Satan! for it is written, <STYLE css="display:block;text-indent:5mm">You shall worship the Lord your God</STYLE><STYLE css="display:block;text-indent:10mm">and him only shall you serve.«</STYLE></VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Then the devil left him, and behold, angels came and ministered to him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Now when Jesus heard that John had been put in prison, he withdrew to Galilee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And leaving Nazareth, he went and dwelt in Capernaum, which is by the sea, in the regions of Zebulun and Naphtali,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">that what was spoken by the prophet Isaiah might be fulfilled:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">
        <STYLE css="display:block;text-indent:5mm">»The land of Zebulun and land of Naphtali,</STYLE>
        <STYLE css="display:block;text-indent:10mm">the way to the sea, beyond the Jordan,</STYLE>
        <STYLE css="display:block;text-indent:15mm">Galilee of the Gentiles</STYLE>

        <STYLE css="display:block;text-indent:10mm">light has dawned.«</STYLE>
      </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">From that time Jesus began to preach and say, »Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">As Jesus was walking by the Sea of Galilee, he saw two brothers, Simon who is called Peter and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea; for they were fishermen.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And he said to them, »Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Immediately they left their nets and followed him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Going on from there, he saw two other brothers, James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, in the boat with Zebedee their father, mending their nets. And he called them,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">and immediately they left the boat and their father, and followed him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And Jesus went about all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing every disease and every sickness among the people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Then his fame spread throughout all Syria, and they brought to him all sick people who were afflicted with various diseases and pains, and those who were demon-possessed, epileptics, and paralytics, and he healed them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Great crowds followed himfrom Galilee, and from the Decapolis, Jerusalem, Judea, and beyond the Jordan.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="5">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Seeing the crowds, he went up on a mountain, and when he sat down his disciples came to him.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="8">Prompted by her mother, she said, »Give me here on a platter the head of John the Baptist.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And the king was sorry; but, because of his oaths and his guests, he commanded it to be given to her;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">so he sent and had John beheaded in prison.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And his head was brought on a platter and given to the girl, and she brought it to her mother.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Then his disciples came and took the body and buried it; and they went and told Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Now when Jesus heard this, he withdrew from there in a boat to a lonely place by himself. But when the crowds heard it, they followed him on foot from the towns.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">When Jesus went ashore he saw a great throng; and he had compassion on them, and healed their sick.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">When it was evening, the disciples came to him and said, »This is a remote place, and its already getting late. Send the crowds away, so they can go to the villages and buy themselves some food.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Jesus said, »They do not need to go away. You give them something to eat.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">They said to him, »We have only five loaves here and two fish.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">He said, »Bring them here to me,«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Then he commanded the multitudes to sit down on the grass. And taking the five loaves and the two fish, and looking up to heaven, he blessed and broke and gave the loaves to the disciples; and the disciples gave them to the multitudes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And they all ate and were satisfied. And they took up twelve baskets full of the broken pieces that were left over.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Now those who ate were about five thousand men, besides women and children.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Immediately Jesus made the disciples get into the boat and go before him to the other side, while he dismissed the multitudes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And after he had dismissed the crowds, he went up on the mountain by himself to pray. When evening came, he was there alone,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">but the boat by this time was many furlongs distant from the land, beaten by the waves; for the wind was against them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And in the fourth watch of the night Jesus went to them, walking on the sea.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">But when the disciples saw him walking on the sea, they were terrified, saying, »It is a ghost!« And they cried out for fear.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">But immediately Jesus spoke to them, saying, »Take courage! It is I; do not be afraid.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And Peter answered him, »Lord, if it is you, command me to come to you on the water.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">So he said, »Come«. Then Peter got down out of the boat, walked on the water, and came toward Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">But when he saw the wind, he was afraid, and beginning to sink he cried out, »Lord, save me!«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Jesus immediately reached out his hand and caught him, and said to him, »O you of little faith, why did you doubt?«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">And when they got into the boat, the wind ceased.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">Then those who were in the boat worshipped him, saying, »Truly you are the Son of God.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">When they had crossed over, they came to land at Gennesaret.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">And when the men of that place recognized him, they sent to all that surrounding region and brought to him all who were sick,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">and begged him that they might only touch the fringe of his garment; and as many as touched it were made well.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="15">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Then the scribes and Pharisees who were from Jerusalem came to Jesus and said,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">»Why do your disciples transgress the tradition of the elders? For they do not wash their hands when they eat.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">He answered them, »And why do you transgress the commandment of God for the sake of your tradition?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">For God commanded, Honor your father and your mother; and, He who curses father or mother, let him be put to death.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">But you say that if a man says to his father or mother, Whatever help you might have received from me is a gift to God</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">he is not to honor his father with it. Thus you have made the word of God of no effect for the sake of your tradition.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">You hypocrites! Well did Isaiah prophesy about you, when he said:</VERS>

      </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And he called the people to him and said to them, »Hear and understand:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">not what goes into the mouth defiles a man, but what comes out of the mouth, this defiles a man.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Then the disciples came and said to him, »Do you know that the Pharisees were offended when they heard this saying?«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">He answered, »Every plant which my heavenly Father has not planted will be rooted up.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Let them alone; they are blind guides. And if a blind man leads a blind man, both will fall into a pit.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">But Peter said to him, »Explain the parable to us.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">So Jesus said, »Are you also still without understanding?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Do you not yet see that whatever enters the mouth goes into the stomach and is eliminated?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">But those things which proceed out of the mouth come from the heart, and they defile a man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">For out of the heart come evil thoughts, murder, adultery, fornications, theft, false witness, slander.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">These are what defile a man; but to eat with unwashed hands does not defile a man.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And Jesus went away from there and withdrew to the region of Tyre and Sidon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And behold, a Canaanite woman from that region came out and cried to him, »Have mercy on me, O Lord, Son of David! My daughter is severely demon-possessed.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">But he did not answer her a word. And his disciples came and urged him, saying, »Send her away, for she is crying out after us.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">He answered, »I was sent only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">But she came and knelt before him, saying, »Lord, help me!«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And he answered, »It is not good to take the childrens bread and throw it to the dogs.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">»Yes, Lord,« she said, »yet even the dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their masters table.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Then Jesus answered her, »O woman, great is your faith! Be it done for you as you desire.« And her daughter was healed from that very hour.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And Jesus went on from there and passed along the Sea of Galilee. And he went up on the mountain, and sat down there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Then great crowds came to him, bringing with them the lame, the maimed, the blind, the mute, and many others; and they laid them down at his feet, and he healed them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">So the multitude marveled when they saw the mute speaking, the maimed made whole, the lame walking, and the blind seeing; and they glorified the God of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">Now Jesus called his disciples to him and said, »I have compassion on the multitude, because they have been with me three days and have nothing to eat. And I do not want to send them away hungry, lest they faint on the way.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">Then his disciples said to him, »Where could we get enough bread in the wilderness to feed such a great crowd?«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">And Jesus said to them, »How many loaves do you have?« They said, »Seven, and a few small fish.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">He told the crowd to sit down on the ground.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">Then he took the seven loaves and the fish, and having given thanks he broke them and gave them to the disciples, and the disciples gave them to the crowds.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">And they all ate and were satisfied; and they took up seven baskets full of the broken pieces that were left over.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">Now those who ate were four thousand men, besides women and children.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">And he sent away the crowds, got into the boat, and went to the region of Magadan.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="16">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Then the Pharisees and Sadducees came, and to test him they asked him to show them a sign from heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">He answered them, »When it is evening, you say, It will be fair weather; for the sky is red.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And in the morning, It will be stormy today, for the sky is red and threatening. You know how to interpret the appearance of the sky, but you cannot interpret the signs of the times.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">A wicked and adulterous generation seeks for a sign, but no sign shall be given to it except the sign of Jonah.« So he left them and departed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">When the disciples reached the other side, they had forgotten to take bread.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Then Jesus said to them, »Take heed and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and the Sadducees.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And they discussed among themselves, saying, »It is because we have taken no bread.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">But Jesus, aware of this, said, »O men of little faith, why do you discuss among yourselves the fact that you have no bread?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Do you not yet perceive? Do you not remember the five loaves of the five thousand, and how many baskets you gathered?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Or the seven loaves of the four thousand, and how many baskets you gathered?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">How is it that you do not understand that I did not speak to you about bread? But beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Then they understood that he did not tell them to beware of the leaven of bread, but of the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">When Jesus came into the region of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, »Who do men say that the Son of Man is?«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And they said, »Some say John the Baptist, others say Elijah, and others Jeremiah or one of the prophets.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">He said to them, »But who do you say that I am?«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Simon Peter answered, »You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And Jesus answered him, »Blessed are you, Simon Bar-Jonah! For flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but my Father who is in heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And I tell you, that you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church, and the gates of Hades shall not prevail against it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Then he strictly charged his disciples to tell no one that he was the Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">From that time Jesus began to show to his disciples that he must go to Jerusalem, and suffer many things from the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and be raised on the third day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Peter took him aside and began to rebuke him saying, »Never, Lord! This shall never happen to you!«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">But he turned and said to Peter, »Get behind me, Satan! You are a stumbling block to me; for you are not mindful of the things of God, but the things of men.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Then Jesus said to his disciples, »If anyone would come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">For whoever desires to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for my sake will find it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">What good will it be for a man if he gains the whole world, and forfeits his soul? Or what can a man give in exchange for his soul?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">For the Son of Man is to come with his angels in the glory of his Father, and then he will reward each man according to what he has done.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Truly, I say to you, there are some standing here who will not taste death before they see the Son of Man coming in his kingdom.«</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="17">
      <VERS vnumber="1">After six days Jesus took with him Peter, James, and John his brother, and led them up a high mountain by themselves.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And he was transfigured before them. His face shone like the sun, and his clothes became as white as the light.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And behold, there appeared to them Moses and Elijah, talking with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And Peter said to Jesus, »Lord, it is good for us to be here; if you wish, I will make here three tabernaclesone for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">While he was still speaking, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them; and a voice from the cloud said, »This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased. Listen to him!«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">When the disciples heard this, they fell on their faces, and were filled with awe.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">But Jesus came and touched them and said, »Rise. Dont be afraid.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And when they lifted up their eyes, they saw no one but Jesus only.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And as they were coming down the mountain, Jesus commanded them, »Tell no one the vision, until the Son of Man is raised from the dead.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And the disciples asked him, »Why then do the scribes say that Elijah must come first?«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Jesus replied, »Elijah is coming first and will restore all things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">But I tell you that Elijah has come already, and they did not know him but did to him whatever they wished. So also the Son of Man is about to suffer at their hands.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Then the disciples understood that he was speaking to them of John the Baptist.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And when they came to the crowd, a man came up to him and kneeling before him said,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">»Lord, have mercy on my son, for he is an epileptic and he suffers terribly; for often he falls into the fire, and often into the water.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And I brought him to your disciples, but they could not heal him.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Then Jesus answered, »O faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you? How long shall I bear with you? Bring him here to me.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And Jesus rebuked the demon, and it came out of him, and the boy was cured from that moment.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Then the disciples came to Jesus privately and said, »Why could we not cast it out?«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">So he said to them, »Because of your little faith. For truly, I say to you, if you have faith as a grain of mustard seed, you will say to this mountain, Move from here to there, and it will move; and nothing will be impossible to you.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">
      </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Now while they were staying in Galilee, Jesus said to them, »The Son of Man is about to be betrayed into the hands of men,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">and they will kill him, and he will be raised on the third day.« And they were greatly distressed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">When they came to Capernaum, the collectors of the half-shekel tax went up to Peter and said, »Does not your teacher pay the temple tax?«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">He said, »Yes.« And when he came into the house, Jesus spoke to him first, saying, »What do you think, Simon? From whom do the kings of the earth take customs or taxes, from their sons or from others?«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And when Peter said, »From others,« Jesus said to him, »Then the sons are free.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Nevertheless, so that we may not offend them, go to the sea, cast in a hook, and take the fish that comes up first. And when you open its mouth, you will find a piece of money; take that and give it to them for me and you.«</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="18">
      <VERS vnumber="1">At that time the disciples came to Jesus, saying, »Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">He called to him a little child, and put him in the midst of them,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="4">Therefore, whoever humbles himself like this child is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Whoever receives one little child like this in my name receives me.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="7">Woe to the world because of temptations to sin! For temptations must come, but woe to the man by whom the temptation comes!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And if your hand or your foot causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to enter life maimed or lame than with two hands or two feet to be thrown into the eternal fire.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And if your eye causes you to sin, pluck it out and throw it away. It is better for you to enter life with one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into the fire of hell.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">»See that you do not despise one of these little ones. For I tell you that in heaven their angels always see the face of my Father who is in heaven.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="12">What do you think? If a man has a hundred sheep, and one of them has gone astray, does he not leave the ninety-nine and go to the mountains in search of the one that went astray?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And if he finds it, truly, I say to you, he rejoices more over that sheep than over the ninety-nine that did not go astray.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">So it is not the will of your Father who is in heaven that one of these little ones should perish.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">»If your brother sins against you, go and tell him his fault, between you and him alone. If he listens to you, you have gained your brother.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">But if he will not listen, take one or two others along with you, so that every matter may be established by the word of two or three witnesses.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">If he refuses to listen to them, tell it to the church; and if he refuses to listen even to the church, let him be to you as a Gentile and a tax collector.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">»Truly, I say to you, whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Again I say to you, that if two of you agree on earth about anything they ask, it will be done for them by my Father in heaven.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="21">Then Peter came to him and said, »Lord, how often shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? Up to seven times?«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Jesus said to him, »I do not say to you seven times, but seventy times seven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Therefore the kingdom of heaven is like a certain king who wanted to settle accounts with his servants.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">When he began the settlement, one was brought to him who owed him ten thousand talents.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And as he was not able to pay, his master ordered that he be sold, with his wife and children and all that he had, and payment to be made.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="27">The master of that servant took pity on him, released him, and forgave him the debt.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">But that servant went out and found one of his fellow servants who owed him a hundred denarii; and he laid hands on him and took him by the throat, saying, Pay me what you owe.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">So his fellow servant fell down at his feet and begged him, Have patience with me, and I will pay you back.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">But he refused, and went and threw him into prison till he should pay the debt.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">When his fellow servants saw what had taken place, they were greatly distressed, and went and told their master all that had happened.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">Then his master, after he had called him, said to him, You wicked servant! I forgave you all that debt because you begged me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">Should not you have had mercy on your fellow servant, just as I had mercy on you?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">And in anger his master delivered him to the jailers to be tortured, until he should pay back all he owed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">So also my heavenly Father will do to each of you, if you do not forgive your brother from your heart.«</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Now when Jesus had finished these sayings, he went away from Galilee and entered the region of Judea beyond the Jordan.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And large crowds followed him, and he healed them there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Some Pharisees came to him to test him. They asked, »Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any and every reason?«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And he answered them, »Have you not read that he who made them at the beginning made them male and female,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">and said, For this reason a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">So they are no longer two, but one flesh. Therefore what God has joined together, let man not separate.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">They said to him, »Why then did Moses command one to give a certificate of divorce, and to put her away?«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">He said to them, »Because of the hardness of your hearts Moses permitted you to divorce your wives, but from the beginning it was not so.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And I say to you, whoever divorces his wife, except for immorality, and marries another woman commits adultery.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">The disciples said to him, »If such is the case of a man with his wife, it is better not to marry.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">But he said to them, »Not all men can accept this saying, but only those to whom it has been given.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">For there are eunuchs who were born that way from their mothers womb, and there are eunuchs who were made eunuchs by men, and there are eunuchs who have made themselves eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven. He who is able to accept it, let him accept it.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Then little children were brought to him that he might put his hands on them and pray, but the disciples rebuked them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">But Jesus said, »Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them; for to such belongs the kingdom of heaven.«</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="16">Now behold, one came up and said to him, »Teacher, what good thing must I do to have eternal life?«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And he said to him, »Why do you ask me about what is good? There is only one who is good. If you want to enter life, keep the commandments.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">He said to him, »Which ones?« And Jesus said, »You shall not murder, you shall not commit adultery, you shall not steal, you shall not bear false witness,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="20">The young man said to him, »All these I have kept. What do I still lack?«</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="22">But when the young man heard this, he went away sorrowful, for he had great possessions.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Then Jesus said to his disciples, »Truly I say to you, it is hard for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">»For the kingdom of heaven is like a landowner who went out early in the morning to hire laborers for his vineyard.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Now when he had agreed with the laborers for a denarius a day, he sent them into his vineyard.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And he went out about the third hour and saw others standing idle in the marketplace,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">and to them he said, You go into the vineyard too, and whatever is right I will give you. So they went.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Again he went out about the sixth hour and the ninth hour, and did the same thing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And about the eleventh hour he went out and found others standing idle, and said to them, Why have you been standing here idle all day?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">They said to him, Because no one has hired us. He said to them, You also go into the vineyard, and whatever is right you will receive.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And when evening came, the owner of the vineyard said to his steward, Call the laborers and pay them their wages, beginning with the last, up to the first.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And when those came who were hired about the eleventh hour, they each received a denarius.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">So when the first came, they thought they would receive more; but each of them also received a denarius.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And when they had received it, they complained against the landowner,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="17">Now as Jesus was going up to Jerusalem, he took the twelve disciples aside, and on the way he said to them,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="23">He said to them, »You will indeed drink my cup, but to sit at my right or my left is not mine to grant, but it is for those for whom it has been prepared by my Father.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And when the ten heard it, they were indignant with the two brothers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">But Jesus called them to him and said, »You know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and their great men exercise authority over them.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="20">And when the disciples saw it, they marveled, saying, »How did the fig tree wither away so soon?«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And Jesus answered them, »Truly, I say to you, if you have faith and do not doubt, you will not only do what was done to the fig tree, but even if you say to this mountain, Be taken up and cast into the sea, it will be done.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And whatever you ask in prayer, you will receive, if you have faith.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And when he entered the temple, the chief priests and the elders of the people came up to him as he was teaching, and said, »By what authority are you doing these things, and who gave you this authority?«</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="5">But they made light of it and went off, one to his own farm, another to his business.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And the rest seized his servants, treated them shamefully, and killed them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">The king was enraged. He sent his army and destroyed those murderers and burned their city.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="13">Then the king said to the attendants, Bind him hand and foot, take him away, and cast him into the outer darkness; there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">When Jesus had finished all these sayings, he said to his disciples,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">Then the chief priests and the elders of the people assembled in the palace of the high priest, who was called Caiaphas,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">and they plotted to arrest Jesus by stealth and kill him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">But they said, »Not during the feast, lest there be a riot among the people.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Now when Jesus was at Bethany in the house of Simon the leper,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">a woman came up to him with an alabaster flask of very expensive perfume, and she poured it on his head as he sat at the table.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">But when the disciples saw it, they were indignant, saying, »Why this waste?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">For this perfume might have been sold for a high price and given to the poor.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">But Jesus, aware of this, said to them, »Why do you trouble the woman? For she has done a beautiful thing to me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">For you always have the poor with you, but you will not always have me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">For in pouring this perfume on my body, she did it to prepare me for burial.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Truly, I say to you, wherever this gospel is preached in the whole world, what she has done will also be told in memory of her.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Then one of the twelve, who was called Judas Iscariot, went to the chief priests</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">and said, »What are you willing to give me if I deliver him to you?« And they counted out to him thirty pieces of silver.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And from that moment he sought an opportunity to betray him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Now on the first day of the Feast of Unleavened Bread, the disciples came to Jesus, saying, »Where do you want us to prepare for you to eat the Passover?«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">He said, »Go into the city to a certain man, and say to him, The Teacher says, my time is at hand; I will keep the Passover at your house with my disciples.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">So the disciples did as Jesus had directed them; and they prepared the Passover.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">When evening had come, he sat at the table with the twelve.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And as they were eating, he said, »Truly, I say to you, one of you will betray me.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And they were very sorrowful, and began to say to him one after another, »Is it I, Lord?«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">He answered, »He who has dipped his hand in the dish with me will betray me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">The Son of Man goes just as it is written of him, but woe to that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed! It would have been better for that man if he had not been born.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Then Judas, who was betraying him, answered, »Rabbi, is it I?« He said to him, »You have said it.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Now as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and blessed, and broke it, and gave it to the disciples and said, »Take, eat; this is my body.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Then he took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave it to them, saying, »Drink from it, all of you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">For this is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">I tell you, I will not drink of this fruit of the vine from now on until that day when I drink it new with you in my Fathers kingdom.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And when they had sung a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Then Jesus said to them, »You will all fall away because of me this night; for it is written, <STYLE css="display:block;text-indent:5mm">I will strike the shepherd,</STYLE><STYLE css="display:block;text-indent:10mm">and the sheep of the flock will be scattered.</STYLE></VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="35">Peter said to him, »Even if I have to die with you, I will not deny you.« And so said all the disciples.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">Then Jesus went with his disciples to a place called Gethsemane, and he said to them, »Sit here while I go over there and pray.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">He took Peter and the two sons of Zebedee along with him, and he began to be sorrowful and troubled.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">Then he said to them, »My soul is exceedingly sorrowful, even to death. Stay here and watch with me.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">And going a little farther he fell on his face and prayed, »O my Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from me; nevertheless, not as I will, but as you will.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">Then he came to the disciples and found them sleeping; and he said to Peter, »So, could you not watch with me one hour?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">Watch and pray, so that you will not enter into temptation. The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">Again, a second time, he went away and prayed, »O my Father, if this cup cannot pass away unless I drink it, your will be done.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">And again he came and found them sleeping, for their eyes were heavy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">So he left them, went away again, and prayed the third time, saying the same words.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">Then he came to the disciples and said to them, »Are you still sleeping and resting? Behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of Man is being betrayed into the hands of sinners.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">Rise, let us be going; see, my betrayer is at hand.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">While he was still speaking, Judas came, one of the twelve, and with him a great crowd with swords and clubs, from the chief priests and the elders of the people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">Now the betrayer had given them a sign, saying, »The one I kiss is the man; seize him.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">And at once he went up to Jesus and said, »Greetings, Rabbi!« and kissed him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">Jesus said to him, »Friend, why are you here?« Then they came up and laid hands on Jesus and seized him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="51">And suddenly, one of those who were with Jesus stretched out his hand and drew his sword, struck the servant of the high priest, and cut off his ear.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="52">But Jesus said to him, »Put your sword back in its place, for all who take the sword will perish by the sword.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="53">Do you think that I cannot appeal to my Father, and he will at once send me more than twelve legions of angels?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="54">But how then could the Scriptures be fulfilled, that it must happen in this way?«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="55">At that hour Jesus said to the crowds, »Have you come out as against a robber, with swords and clubs to capture me? Every day I sat in the temple teaching, and you did not seize me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="56">But all this has taken place, that the Scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled.« Then all the disciples forsook him and fled.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="57">And those who had seized Jesus led him away to Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders had assembled.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="58">But Peter followed him at a distance, right up to the courtyard of the high priest. He entered and sat down with the guards to see the end.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="59">Now the chief priests and the whole council sought false testimony against Jesus that they might put him to death,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="60">but they found none, though many false witnesses came forward. At last two came forward</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="61">and said, »This fellow said, I am able to destroy the temple of God, and to build it in three days.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="62">And the high priest stood up and said, »Have you no answer to make? What is it that these men testify against you?«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="63">But Jesus remained silent. And the high priest said to him, »I charge you under oath by the living God: tell us if you are the Christ, the Son of God.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="64">Jesus said to him, »It is as you said.

      <VERS vnumber="65">Then the high priest tore his clothes and said, »He has spoken blasphemy! Why do we need any more witnesses? Look, now you have heard his blasphemy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="66">What do you think?« They answered, »He is worthy of death.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="67">Then they spat in his face and struck him with their fists; and others slapped him,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="68">saying, »Prophesy to us, Christ! Who is the one who struck you?«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="69">Now Peter was sitting outside in the courtyard, and a servant girl came to him and said, »You also were with Jesus of Galilee.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="70">But he denied it before them all, saying, »I do not know what you are talking about.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="71">And when he went out to the gateway, another girl saw him and said to the people there, »This fellow was with Jesus of Nazareth.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="72">But again he denied it with an oath, »I do not know the man!«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="73">After a little while those who stood by came up and said to Peter, »Surely you are also one of them, for your accent betrays you.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="74">Then he began to invoke a curse on himself and to swear, »I do not know the man.« And immediately the rooster crowed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="75">And Peter remembered the word Jesus had said, »Before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times.« So he went out and wept bitterly.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">When morning came, all the chief priests and the elders of the people took counsel against Jesus to put him to death.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">When Judas, his betrayer, saw that he was condemned, he repented and brought back the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and the elders,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">saying, »I have sinned by betraying innocent blood.« And they said, »What is that to us? You see to it!«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Then he threw down the pieces of silver in the temple and departed, and went and hanged himself.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But the chief priests took the silver pieces and said, »It is not lawful to put them into the treasury, since they are the money of blood.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">So they took counsel, and bought with them the potters field, to bury strangers in.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Therefore that field has been called the Field of Blood to this day.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="22">Pilate said to them, »Then what shall I do with Jesus who is called Christ?« They all said, »Let him be crucified!«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And he said, »Why, what evil has he done?« But they shouted all the more, »Let him be crucified!«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">When Pilate saw that he was gaining nothing, but rather that a riot was starting, he took water and washed his hands before the crowd, saying, »I am innocent of this mans blood. See to it yourselves.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And all the people answered, »His blood be on us and on our children!«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Then he released Barabbas to them; and when he had scourged Jesus, he delivered him to be crucified.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the Praetorium and gathered the whole garrison around him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And they stripped him and put a scarlet robe on him,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">and when they had twisted a crown of thorns, they put it on his head, and a reed in his right hand. And they bowed the knee before him and mocked him, saying, »Hail, King of the Jews!«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And they spat on him, and took the reed and struck him on the head.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">And when they had mocked him, they took the robe off him, put his own clothes on him, and led him away to crucify him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">Now as they came out, they found a man of Cyrene, Simon by name, and they compelled him to carry his cross.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">And when they came to a place called Golgotha (which means the place of a skull),</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">they offered him wine to drink, mingled with gall; but when he tasted it, he would not drink it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">And when they had crucified him, they divided his garments among them by casting lots;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">and sitting down, they kept watch over him there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">And they put up over his head the charge written against him: <STYLE css="display:block;text-align:center">THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS.</STYLE></VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">Then two robbers were crucified with him, one on the right and one on the left.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">And those who passed by hurled insults at him, wagging their heads</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">and saying, »You who would destroy the temple and build it in three days, save yourself! If you are the Son of God, come down from the cross.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">So also the chief priests, with the scribes and elders, mocked him, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">»He saved others; he cannot save himself. He is the King of Israel; let him come down now from the cross, and we will believe in him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">He trusts in God; let God deliver him now, if he desires him; for he said, I am the Son of God.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">And the robbers who were crucified with him also reviled him in the same way.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">Now from the sixth hour until the ninth hour there was darkness over all the land.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">And about the ninth hour Jesus cried out with a loud voice, »Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani?« that is, »My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">When some of those standing there heard this, they said, »This man is calling Elijah.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">Immediately one of them ran and took a sponge, filled it with wine vinegar and put it on a reed, and offered it to him to drink.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">The rest said, »Let him alone; let us see if Elijah will come to save him.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">And Jesus cried out again with a loud voice, and yielded up his spirit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="51">And behold, the curtain of the temple was torn in two, from top to bottom; and the earth shook, and the rocks were split;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="52">the tombs also were opened, and many bodies of the saints who had fallen asleep were raised,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="53">and coming out of the tombs after his resurrection, they went into the holy city and appeared to many.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="54">So when the centurion and those with him, who were guarding Jesus, saw the earthquake and the things that had happened, they were terrified, and said, »Truly this was the Son of God!«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="55">And many women were also there, looking on from afar, who had followed Jesus from Galilee, ministering to him;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="56">among whom were Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James and Joses, and the mother of Zebedees sons.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="57">And when it was evening, there came a rich man from Arimathea, named Joseph, who had himself also become a disciple of Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="58">He went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus. Then Pilate ordered it to be given to him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="59">When Joseph took the body, he wrapped it in a clean linen cloth,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="60">and laid it in his own new tomb, which he had hewn out of the rock; and he rolled a great stone to the door of the tomb, and departed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="61">Mary Magdalene and the other Mary were sitting there opposite the tomb.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="62">The next day, the one after the day of Preparation, the chief priests and the Pharisees gathered to Pilate</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="63">and said, »Sir, we remember how that deceiver said, while he was still alive, After three days I will rise again.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="64">Therefore order that the tomb be made secure until the third day, lest his disciples come by night and steal him away, and tell the people, He has risen from the dead. So the last deception will be worse than the first.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="65">Pilate said to them, »You have a guard; go your way, make it as secure as you know how.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="66">So they went and made the tomb secure by sealing the stone and setting a guard.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="28">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now after the Sabbath, as the first day of the week began to dawn, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went to see the tomb.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And behold, there was a great earthquake; for an angel of the Lord descended from heaven, and came and rolled back the stone from the door, and sat on it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">His appearance was like lightning, and his clothes were white as snow.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And the guards shook for fear of him, and became like dead men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">But the angel said to the women, »Do not be afraid, for I know that you seek Jesus who was crucified.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">He is not here; for he has risen, as he said. Come, see the place where he lay.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Then go quickly and tell his disciples that he has risen from the dead. And behold, he is going before you to Galilee; there you will see him. Behold, I have told you.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">So they departed quickly from the tomb with fear and great joy, and ran to tell his disciples.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And behold, Jesus met them and said, »Hail!« And they came to him and took hold of his feet and worshipped him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Then Jesus said to them, »Do not be afraid. Go and tell my brethren to go to Galilee; and there they will see me.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Now while they were going, behold, some of the guard went into the city and reported to the chief priests all the things that had happened.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">When they had assembled with the elders and consulted together, they gave a large sum of money to the soldiers,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">and said, »Tell them, His disciples came by night and stole him away while we were asleep.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And if this comes to the governors ears, we will satisfy him and keep you out of trouble.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">So they took the money and did as they were instructed; and this story has been spread among the Jews to this day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Then the eleven disciples went to Galilee, to the mountain which Jesus had appointed for them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">When they saw him, they worshipped him; but some doubted.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And Jesus came and said to them, »All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="9">In those days Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="11">And a voice came from heaven, »You are my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">The Spirit immediately drove him out into the wilderness.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="14">Now after John was put in prison, Jesus came to Galilee, preaching the gospel of God,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="20">And immediately he called them; and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired servants, and followed him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And they went into Capernaum, and immediately on the Sabbath he entered the synagogue and taught.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And they were astonished at his teaching, for he taught them as one who had authority, and not as the scribes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Now there was a man in their synagogue with an unclean spirit. And he cried out,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="28">And at once his fame spread everywhere throughout all the surrounding region of Galilee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">As soon as they left the synagogue, they went with James and John, and entered the house of Simon and Andrew.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Now Simon's mother-in-law lay sick with a fever, and immediately they told him about her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">So he came and took her by the hand and lifted her up, and immediately the fever left her. And she served them.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="39">And he went throughout all Galilee, preaching in their synagogues and casting out demons.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="45">But he went out and began to talk freely about it, and to spread the news, so that Jesus could no longer openly enter a town, but was outside in the deserted places; and people came to him from every quarter.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">Then they came to him, bringing a paralytic carried by four men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And when they could not get near him because of the crowd, they made an opening in the roof above him; and when they had broken through, they let down the pallet on which the paralytic was lying.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">When Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralytic, »Son, your sins are forgiven.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Now some of the scribes were sitting there, reasoning in their hearts,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">»Why does this man speak like this? He is blaspheming! Who can forgive sins but God alone?«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And immediately, when Jesus perceived in his spirit that they reasoned thus within themselves, he said to them, »Why do you reason about these things in your hearts?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Which is easier, to say to the paralytic, Your sins are forgiven, or to say, Rise, take up your pallet and walk?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins«he said to the paralytic,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">»I say to you, rise, take up your pallet and go home.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And he rose, and immediately took up the pallet and went out in the sight of them all; so that they were all amazed and glorified God, saying, »We never saw anything like this!«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Then he went out again beside the sea; and all the crowd came to him, and he taught them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">As he passed by, he saw Levi the son of Alphaeus sitting at the tax office, and he said to him, »Follow me.« So he rose and followed him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And as he sat at table in Levi's house, many tax collectors and sinners were sitting with Jesus and his disciples; for there were many who followed him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And the scribes of the Pharisees, when they saw him eating with sinners and tax collectors, said to his disciples, »Why does he eat with tax collectors and sinners?«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And when Jesus heard it, he said to them, »Those who are well have no need of a physician, but those who are sick. I did not come to call the righteous, but sinners.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Now John's disciples and the Pharisees were fasting. And people came and said to him, »Why do Johns disciples and the disciples of the Pharisees fast, but your disciples do not fast?«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And Jesus said to them, »Can the guests of the bridegroom fast while he is with them? As long as they have the bridegroom with them, they cannot fast.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">But the days will come, when the bridegroom will be taken away from them, and then they will fast in that day.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="23">One Sabbath he was going through the grainfields; and as they made their way his disciples began to pluck heads of grain.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And the Pharisees said to him, »Look, why are they doing what is not lawful on the Sabbath?«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">But he said to them, »Have you never read what David did when he was in need and hungry, he and those who were with him:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">how he entered the house of God in the days of Abiathar the high priest, and ate the consecrated bread, which is not lawful to eat, except for the priests, and also gave some to those who were with him?«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And he said to them, »The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">So the Son of Man is Lord even of the Sabbath.«</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="3">
      <VERS vnumber="1">He entered the synagogue again, and a man was there who had a withered hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And they watched him closely, to see whether he would heal him on the Sabbath, so that they might accuse him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And he said to the man who had the withered hand, »Come here.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Then he said to them, »Is it lawful on the Sabbath to do good or to do evil, to save life or to kill?« But they kept silent.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And he looked around at them with anger, grieved at the hardness of their hearts, and said to the man, »Stretch out your hand.« He stretched it out, and his hand was restored.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Then the Pharisees went out and immediately plotted with the Herodians against him, how they might destroy him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Jesus withdrew with his disciples to the sea, and a great multitude from Galilee followed; also from Judea</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">and Jerusalem and Idumea and beyond the Jordan and from around Tyre and Sidon, a great multitude, when they heard how many things he was doing, came to him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And he told his disciples to have a small boat ready for him because of the crowd, lest they should crush him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">For he had healed many, so that all who had diseases pressed upon him to touch him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And whenever the unclean spirits saw him, they fell down before him and cried out, »You are the Son of God.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">But he strictly ordered them not to make him known.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And he went up on the mountain, and called to him those he himself wanted. And they came to him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Then he appointed twelve, that they might be with him and that he might send them out to preach,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">and to have authority to cast out the demons:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Simon, to whom he gave the name Peter;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">James the son of Zebedee and John the brother of James, to whom he gave the name Boanerges, that is, »Sons of Thunder«;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Andrew, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, James the son of Alphaeus, Thaddaeus, Simon the Zealot;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">and Judas Iscariot, who betrayed him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Then he went home; and the crowd came together again, so that they could not even eat.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">When his family heard about this, they went to take charge of him, for they said, »He is out of his mind.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And the scribes who came down from Jerusalem said, »He is possessed by Beelzebub, and by the prince of demons he casts out the demons.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">So he called them to himself and said to them in parables: »How can Satan cast out Satan?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">If a kingdom is divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And if a house is divided against itself, that house cannot stand.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="27">No one can enter a strong man's house and plunder his goods, unless he first binds the strong man. And then he will plunder his house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Truly, I say to you, all sins will be forgiven the sons of men, and whatever blasphemies they utter;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">but whoever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit never has forgiveness, but is guilty of an eternal sin«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">because they said, »He has an unclean spirit.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Then his brothers and his mother came. And standing outside they sent to him, and called him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">And a crowd was sitting around him; and they said to him, »Your mother and your brothers are outside, asking for you.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">And he replied, »Who are my mother and my brothers?«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">And he looked at those who sat in a circle around him, and said, »Here are my mother and my brothers!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">Whoever does the will of God is my brother, and sister, and mother.«</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="4">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Again he began to teach by the sea. and a very large crowd gathered around him, so that he got into a boat and sat in it on the sea; and the whole crowd was beside the sea on the land.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Then he taught them many things by parables, and said to them in his teaching:</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="5">Some fell on rocky ground, where it did not have much soil, and immediately it sprang up, because it had no depth of soil.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But when the sun came up it was scorched, and because it had no root it withered away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Other seed fell among thorns and the thorns grew up and choked it, and it yielded no grain.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">But other seed fell on good soil and yielded a crop that sprang up, increased and produced thirtyfold, sixty, and a hundred.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And he said, »He who has ears to hear, let him hear.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And when he was alone, those around him with the twelve asked him about the parables.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And he said to them, »To you has been given the secret of the kingdom of God, but to those outside everything is in parables;</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="13">And he said to them, »Do you not understand this parable? How then will you understand all the parables?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">The sower sows the word.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And these are the ones along the path where the word is sown. When they hear, Satan comes immediately and takes away the word that was sown in them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And these likewise are the ones sown on rocky ground who, when they hear the word, immediately receive it with joy;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">and they have no root in themselves, but endure for only a time. Then, when tribulation or persecution arises on account of the word, immediately they fall away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And others are the ones sown among thorns; they are those who hear the word,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">but the cares of this world, the deceitfulness of riches, and the desires for other things enter in and choke the word, and it becomes unfruitful.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">But these are the ones sown on good soil, those who hear the word, accept it, and bear fruit thirtyfold, sixty, and a hundred.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And he said to them, »Is a lamp brought to be put under a basket or under a bed? Is it not to be set on a lampstand?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">For there is nothing hidden, except to be revealed; nor is anything secret, but that it should come to light.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">If anyone has ears to hear, let him hear.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Then he said to them, »Take heed what you hear. With the measure you use, it will be measured to you; and more will be given you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">For whoever has, to him will more be given; and whoever does not have, from him even what he has will be taken away.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And he said, »The kingdom of God is as if a man should scatter seed on the ground,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">and should sleep by night and rise by day, and the seed should sprout and grow, he himself does not know how.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">All by itself the earth produces grainfirst the blade, then the head, then the full kernel in the head.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">But when the grain is ripe, at once he puts in the sickle, because the harvest has come.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And he said, »With what shall we compare the kingdom of God, or what parable shall we use for it?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">It is like a mustard seed which, when it is sown on the ground, is the smallest of all seeds in the earth;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">yet when it is sown it grows up and becomes the greatest of all shrubs, and puts forth large branches, so that the birds of the air can make nests in its shade.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">With many such parables he spoke the word to them, as they were able to hear it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">But without a parable he did not speak to them. And when they were alone, he explained everything to his own disciples.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">On that day, when evening had come, he said to them, »Let us go over to the other side.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">And leaving the crowd, they took him along, just as he was, in the boat. There were also other boats with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">And a great storm arose, and the waves beat into the boat, so that it was already filling.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">But he was in the stern, asleep on a cushion. And they woke him and said to him, »Teacher, do you not care if we perish?«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">Then he rose and rebuked the wind, and said to the sea, »Peace! Be still!« And the wind ceased and there was a great calm.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">He said to them, »Why are you so afraid? Have you no faith?«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">And they were filled with awe, and said to one another, »Who is this? Even the wind and the sea obey him!«</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="5">
      <VERS vnumber="1">They came to the other side of the sea, to the country of the Gerasenes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And when he had come out of the boat, there met him out of the tombs a man with an unclean spirit,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">who lived among the tombs; and no one could bind him any more, not even with a chain,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">for he had often been bound with shackles and chains. But the chains he wrenched apart, and the shackles he broke in pieces; and no one had the strength to subdue him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Night and day among the tombs and on the mountains he was always crying out, and cutting himself with stones.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And when he saw Jesus from a distance, he ran and worshipped him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And crying out with a loud voice, he said, »What have you to do with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I implore you by God, do not torment me.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">For he had said to him, »Come out of the man, you unclean spirit!«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Then Jesus asked him, »What is your name?« And he replied, »My name is Legion, for we are many.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And he begged him eagerly not to send them out of the country.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Now a large herd of swine was feeding there on the hillside.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">So all the demons begged him, »Send us to the swine, that we may enter them.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">So he gave them permission. And the unclean spirits came out, and entered the swine; and the herd, numbering about two thousand, rushed down the steep bank into the sea, and were drowned in the sea.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">So those who fed the swine fled, and told it in the city and in the country. And people went out to see what it was that had happened.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And they came to Jesus, and saw the man who had been possessed sitting there, clothed and in his right mind, the man who had had the legion; and they were afraid.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And those who had seen it told the people what had happened to the demon-possessed man, and about the swine.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Then they began to plead with Jesus to depart from their region.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And as he was getting into the boat, the man who had been demon-possessed begged him that he might be with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Jesus did not let him, but said, »Go home to your friends and tell them how much the Lord has done for you, and how he has had mercy on you.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And he went away and began to proclaim in the Decapolis how much Jesus had done for him; and all men marveled.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And when Jesus had crossed over again by the boat to the other side, a great crowd gathered around him; and he was by the sea.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Then came one of the rulers of the synagogue, Jairus by name. And seeing him, he fell at his feet,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">and pleaded earnestly with him, saying, »My little daughter is at the point of death. Come and lay your hands on her, so that she may be healed, and live.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">So Jesus went with him. <STYLE css="display:block;text-indent:5mm">And a great crowd followed him and thronged around him.</STYLE></VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And there was a woman who had endured a flow of blood for twelve years,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">and she had suffered much under many physicians, and had spent all that she owned, and was no better but rather grew worse.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">When she heard about Jesus, she came up behind him in the crowd and touched his garment.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">For she said, »If I touch even his clothes, I shall be made well.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And immediately the bleeding stopped; and she felt in her body that she was healed of her disease.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And Jesus, immediately knowing in himself that power had gone out from him, turned around in the crowd and said, »Who touched my clothes?«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">And his disciples said to him, »You see the crowd pressing around you, and yet you say, Who touched me?«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">And he looked around to see who had done it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">But the woman, knowing what had happened to her, came and fell down before him in fear and trembling and told him the whole truth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">And he said to her, »Daughter, your faith has made you well. Go in peace, and be healed of your disease.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">While he was still speaking, some came from the ruler of the synagogue's house who said, »Your daughter is dead. Why trouble the Teacher any further?«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">But ignoring what they said, Jesus said to the ruler of the synagogue, »Do not be afraid; only believe.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">And he allowed no one to follow him except Peter, James, and John the brother of James.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">When they came to the house of the ruler of the synagogue, he saw a tumult, and people weeping and wailing loudly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">And when he came in, he said to them, »Why make this commotion and weep? The child is not dead, but sleeping.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">And they laughed at him. But after he put them all outside, he took the child's father and mother and those who were with him, and went in where the child was.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">He took her by the hand and said to her, »Talitha cumi!« which means, »Little girl, I say to you, arise.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">Immediately the girl stood up and walked (she was twelve years of age). And they were overcome with great amazement.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">He strictly charged them that no one should know this, and told them to give her something to eat.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="6">
      <VERS vnumber="1">He went away from there and came to his own country, and his disciples followed him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And when the Sabbath had come, he began to teach in the synagogue. And many who heard him were astonished, saying, »Where did this man get these things? And what wisdom is this which is given to him, that such mighty works are performed by his hands!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary and brother of James and Joses and Judas and Simon? Are not his sisters here with us?« And they took offense at him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">But Jesus said to them, »A prophet is not without honor except in his own country, among his own relatives, and in his own house.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Now he could do no mighty work there, except that he laid his hands on a few sick people and healed them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And he marveled because of their unbelief. Then he went around the villages teaching.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And he called to him the twelve, and began to send them out two by two, and gave them authority over the unclean spirits.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">He commanded them to take nothing for the journey except a staffno bag, no bread, no money in their belts</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">but to wear sandals and not put on two tunics.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And he said to them, »Where you enter a house, stay there until you leave that place.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And if any place will not receive you and they refuse to hear you, when you leave, shake off the dust that is on your feet for a testimony against them.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">So they went out and preached that people should repent.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And they cast out many demons, and anointed with oil many that were sick and healed them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">King Herod heard of it, for Jesus' name had become well known. Some said, »John the Baptist has been raised from the dead, and that is why these powers are at work in him.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">But others said, »It is Elijah.« And others said, »It is a prophet, like one of the prophets of old.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">But when Herod heard, he said, »This is John, whom I beheaded; he has been raised from the dead!«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">For Herod himself had sent and had John arrested, and bound him in prison for the sake of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife; because he had married her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">For John had said to Herod, »It is not lawful for you to have your brother's wife.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And Herodias had a grudge against him, and wanted to kill him. But she could not,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">for Herod feared John and protected him, knowing that he was a righteous and holy man. When he heard him, he was much perplexed; and yet he heard him gladly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">But an opportunity came when Herod on his birthday gave a banquet for his high officers and military commanders and the leading men of Galilee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And when the daughter of Herodias came in and danced, she pleased Herod and his dinner guests. The king said to the girl, »Ask me for whatever you want, and I will give it to you.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And he vowed to her, »Whatever you ask me, I will give you, up to half of my kingdom.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">So she went out and said to her mother, »What shall I ask?« And she said, »The head of John the Baptist!«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Immediately she came in with haste to the king and asked, saying, »I want you to give me at once the head of John the Baptist on a platter.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And the king was exceedingly sorry; but, because of his oaths and his guests, he did not want to refuse her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And immediately the king sent an executioner and gave orders to bring his head. He went and beheaded him in the prison,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">and brought his head on a platter, and gave it to the girl; and the girl gave it to her mother.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">When his disciples heard of it, they came and took his body, and laid it in a tomb.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">The apostles gathered to Jesus, and told him all that they had done and taught.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">And he said to them, »Come away by yourselves to a lonely place and rest a while.« For there were many coming and going, and they did not even have time to eat.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">So they went away in the boat to a lonely place by themselves.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">But many saw them going, and knew them, and they ran there on foot from all the towns, and got there ahead of them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">When Jesus went ashore he saw a great crowd, and he had compassion on them, because they were like sheep without a shepherd. So he began to teach them many things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">When it was late in the day, his disciples came to him and said, »This is a deserted place, and already the hour is late.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">Send them away, so they can go to the surrounding country and villages and buy themselves something to eat.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">But he answered them, »You give them something to eat.« And they said to him, »Shall we go and buy two hundred denarii worth of bread, and give it to them to eat?«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">But he said to them, »How many loaves do you have? Go and see.« And when they found out they said, »Five, and two fish.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">Then he commanded them to make them all sit down in groups on the green grass.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">So they sat down in groups, of hundreds and fifties.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">And taking the five loaves and the two fish he looked up to heaven, and blessed, and broke the loaves, and gave them to his disciples to set before the people; and he divided the two fish among them all.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">And they all ate and were satisfied.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">And they took up twelve baskets full of broken pieces and of the fish.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">Now those who had eaten the loaves were about five thousand men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">Immediately he made his disciples get into the boat and go before him to the other side, to Bethsaida, while he dismissed the crowd.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">And after he had left them, he went up on the mountain to pray.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">When evening came, the boat was in the middle of the sea, and he was alone on land.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">And he saw the disciples straining at the oars, for the wind was against them. About the fourth watch of the night he came to them, walking on the sea. He was about to pass by them,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">but when they saw him walking on the sea they thought it was a ghost, and cried out;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">for they all saw him, and were terrified. But immediately he spoke to them and said, »Take courage! It is I; do not be afraid.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="51">Then he climbed into the boat with them, and the wind ceased. And they were completely amazed,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="52">for they had not understood about the loaves, because their hearts were hardened.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="53">When they had crossed over, they came to land at Gennesaret and anchored there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="54">And when they got out of the boat, immediately the people recognized him,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="55">and ran about that whole region, and began to carry those who were sick around on pallets to wherever they heard he was.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="56">Wherever he entered, into villages, cities, or the country, they laid the sick in the marketplaces, and begged him that they might touch even the fringe of his garment. And as many as touched him were made well.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="7">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now when the Pharisees and some of the scribes who had come from Jerusalem gathered together to him,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">they saw some of his disciples eating food with hands that were defiled, that is, unwashed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">(For the Pharisees and all the Jews do not eat unless they wash their hands in a special way, holding the tradition of the elders.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">When they come from the marketplace, they do not eat unless they wash themselves. And there are many other traditions which they observe, the washing of cups and pitchers and copper vessels. )</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">The Pharisees and the scribes asked him, »Why do your disciples not live according to the tradition of the elders, but eat with impure hands?«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And he said to them, »Well did Isaiah prophesy of you hypocrites; as it is written: <STYLE css="display:block;text-indent:5mm">This people honors me with their lips,</STYLE><STYLE css="display:block;text-indent:10mm">but their heart is far from me.</STYLE></VERS>

      </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">You let go of the commandment of God, and hold on to the tradition of men.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And he said to them, »You have a fine way of rejecting the commandment of God, in order to keep your tradition!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">For Moses said, Honor your father and your mother; and, He who curses father or mother, let him be put to death.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">But you say that if a man says to his father or mother, Whatever help you might otherwise have received from me is Corban (that is, a gift devoted to God),</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">then you no longer let him do anything for his father or mother,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">thus making void the word of God through your tradition which you have handed down. And many such things you do.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And he called all the people to him again, and said to them, »Hear me, everyone, and understand:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">there is nothing outside a man which by going into him can defile him; but the things which come out of a man are what defile him.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">
      </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">When he had left the crowd and entered the house, his disciples asked him about this parable.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">So he said to them, »Are you also without understanding? Do you not see that whatever enters a man from outside cannot defile him,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">since it does not enter his heart but his stomach, and so passes on?« (Thus he declared all foods clean.)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And he said, »What comes out of a man is what defiles a man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">For from within, out of the heart of men, come evil thoughts, fornications, theft, murder, adultery,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">coveting, wickedness, deceit, lewdness, envy, slander, pride, foolishness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">All these evil things come from within, and they defile a man.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">From there he arose and went away to the region of Tyre and Sidon. And he entered a house, and did not want anyone to know it; yet he could not be hidden.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">But a woman whose little daughter was possessed by an unclean spirit heard about him, and she came and fell at his feet.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Now the woman was a Greek, a Syrophoenician by birth. And she begged him to cast the demon out of her daughter.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And he said to her, »Let the children first be fed, for it is not right to take the childrens bread and throw it to the dogs.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">But she answered him, »Yes, Lord, yet even the dogs under the table eat the children's crumbs.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Then he said to her, »For this saying you may go your way; the demon has left your daughter.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">She went home, and found her child lying on the bed, and the demon gone.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Then he departed from the region of Tyre, and went through Sidon to the Sea of Galilee, through the region of the Decapolis.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">Then they brought to him a man who was deaf and had an impediment in his speech, and they begged him to put his hand on him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">And he took him aside from the multitude, and put his fingers into his ears, and he spat and touched his tongue.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">And looking up to heaven he sighed and said to him, »Ephphatha,« that is, »Be opened.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">And <STYLE css="font-style:italic">immediately</STYLE> his ears were opened, and the impediment of his tongue was loosed, and he spoke plainly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">And he commanded them to tell no one; but the more he charged them, the more widely they proclaimed it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">And they were astonished beyond measure, saying, »He has done all things well. He even makes the deaf to hear and the mute to speak.«</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="8">
      <VERS vnumber="1">In those days, when again a great crowd had gathered, and they had nothing to eat, Jesus called his disciples to him, and said to them,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">»I have compassion on the multitude, because they have now been with me three days and have nothing to eat.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And if I send them away hungry to their homes, they will faint on the way; and some of them have come a long distance.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And his disciples answered him, »How can one feed these men with bread here in the desert?«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And he asked them, »How many loaves do you have?« They said, »Seven.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">So he commanded the crowd to sit down on the ground. And he took the seven loaves, and having given thanks he broke them and gave them to his disciples to set before the people; and they set them before the crowd.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">They also had a few small fish; and having blessed them, he commanded that these also should be set before them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">They ate, and were satisfied; and they took up seven baskets full of the broken pieces left over.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">About four thousand men were present. And having sent them away,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">he immediately got into the boat with his disciples, and went to the region of Dalmanutha.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">The Pharisees came and began to argue with him, seeking from him a sign from heaven, to test him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And he sighed deeply in his spirit, and said, »Why does this generation seek a sign? Truly, I say to you, no sign shall be given to this generation.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And he left them, and getting into the boat again he departed to the other side.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Now the disciples had forgotten to bring bread, and they had only one loaf with them in the boat.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And he cautioned them, saying, »Take heed, beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and the leaven of Herod.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And they discussed it with one another, saying, »It is because we have no bread.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Being aware of it, Jesus said to them, »Why do you discuss the fact that you have no bread? Do you not yet perceive or understand? Are your hearts hardened?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Having eyes do you not see, and having ears do you not hear? And do you not remember?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">When I broke the five loaves for the five thousand, how many baskets full of broken pieces did you take up?« They said to him, »Twelve.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">»And when I broke the seven for the four thousand, how many large baskets full of pieces did you take up?« And they said, »Seven.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">He said to them, »Do you not yet understand?«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And they came to Bethsaida; and some people brought a blind man to him, and begged him to touch him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">So he took the blind man by the hand and led him out of the village. And when he had spit on his eyes and put his hands on him, he asked him »Do you see anything?«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And he looked up and said, »I see men; but they look like trees, walking.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Then he put his hands on his eyes again and made him look up. And he was restored, and saw everything clearly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And he sent him away to his home, saying, »Do not even go into the village.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And Jesus went on with his disciples, to the villages of Caesarea Philippi; and on the way he asked his disciples, »Who do men say that I am?«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">They replied, »Some say John the Baptist; others say Elijah; and still others, one of the prophets.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And he asked them, »But who do you say that I am?« Peter answered him, »You are the Christ.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And he charged them to tell no one about him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">And he began to teach them that the Son of Man must suffer many things, and be rejected by the elders and the chief priests and the scribes, and be killed, and after three days rise again.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">He spoke plainly about this. And Peter took him aside and began to rebuke him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">But when he had turned around and looked at his disciples, he rebuked Peter, and said, »Get behind me, Satan! For you are not mindful of the things of God, but the things of men.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">And he called to him the multitude with his disciples, and said to them, »If anyone would come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">For whoever desires to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for my sake and the gospels will save it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">For what does it profit a man to gain the whole world, and forfeit his soul?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">Or what can a man give in exchange for his soul?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">For whoever is ashamed of me and my words in this adulterous and sinful generation, of him the Son of Man will also be ashamed when he comes in the glory of his Father with the holy angels.«</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">And he said to them, »Truly, I say to you that there are some standing here who will not taste death before they see the kingdom of God come with power.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">After six days Jesus took with him Peter and James and John, and led them up a high mountain apart by themselves. And he was transfigured before them,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">and his clothes became dazzling, exceedingly white, as no launderer on earth could bleach them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And there appeared to them Elijah with Moses, and they were talking with Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And Peter said to Jesus, »Rabbi, it is good for us to be here. And let us make three tabernaclesone for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">For he did not know what to say, for they were greatly afraid.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And a cloud came and overshadowed them; and a voice came out of the cloud, »This is my beloved Son. Listen to him!«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Suddenly, when they looked around, they no longer saw anyone with them but Jesus only.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And as they were coming down the mountain, he charged them to tell no one what they had seen, until the Son of Man had risen from the dead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">So they kept the matter to themselves, questioning what the rising from the dead meant.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And they asked him, »Why do the scribes say that Elijah must come first?«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Then he said to them, »Elijah does come first and restores all things. And how is it written of the Son of Man, that he must suffer many things and be treated with contempt?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">But I tell you that Elijah has come, and they did to him whatever they wished, as it is written of him.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And when they came to the disciples, they saw a great crowd around them, and scribes arguing with them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Immediately, when they saw him, all the people were greatly amazed, and ran to him and greeted him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And he asked them, »What are you discussing with them?«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And one of the crowd answered him, »Teacher, I brought my son to you, who has a mute spirit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And wherever it seizes him, it throws him down; he foams at the mouth, gnashes his teeth and becomes rigid. I asked your disciples to cast out the spirit, but they could not.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">He answered him, »O faithless generation, how long shall I be with you? How long shall I bear with you? Bring him to me.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And they brought the boy to him. And when the spirit saw him, immediately it convulsed the boy, and he fell on the ground and rolled about, foaming at the mouth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And Jesus asked his father, »How long has he been like this?« And he said, »From childhood.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And it has often thrown him both into the fire and into the water to destroy him. But if you can do anything, have pity on us and help us.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Jesus said to him, »If you can, all things are possible to him who believes.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Immediately the father of the child cried out and said, »I believe; help my unbelief!«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And when Jesus saw that a crowd came running together, he rebuked the unclean spirit, saying to it, »You dumb and deaf spirit, I command you, come out of him, and never enter him again.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And the spirit cried out, convulsed him terribly, and came out. And the boy was like a corpse; so that many of them said, »He is dead.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">But Jesus took him by the hand and lifted him up, and he arose.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And when he had come into the house, his disciples asked him privately, »Why could we not cast it out?«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And he said to them, »This kind can only come out by prayer.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Then they departed from there and passed through Galilee, and he did not want anyone to know it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">For he was teaching his disciples and said to them, »The Son of Man is going to be betrayed into the hands of men. They will kill him, and when he is killed, after three days he will rise.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">But they did not understand the saying, and they were afraid to ask him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">And they came to Capernaum. When he was in the house, he asked them, »What were you discussing on the road?«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">But they kept silent; for on the way they had discussed with one another who was the greatest.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">And he sat down, called the twelve, and said to them, »If anyone desires to be first, he must be last of all and servant of all.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">And he took a little child, and put him in the midst of them. And taking him in his arms, he said to them,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">»Whoever receives one of these little children in my name receives me; and whoever receives me, receives not me but him who sent me.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">John said to him, »Teacher, we saw a man casting out demons in your name and we forbade him, because he was not one of us.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">But Jesus said, »Do not forbid him, for no one who does a miracle in my name can soon afterward speak evil of me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">For he who is not against us is for us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">For truly, I say to you, whoever gives you a cup of water to drink in my name, because you belong to Christ, will by no means lose his reward.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Then he left there and went to the region of Judea and beyond the Jordan. And crowds gathered to him again; and again, as his custom was, he taught them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">The Pharisees came and in order to test him asked, »Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife?«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">He answered them, »What did Moses command you?«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">They said, »Moses permitted a man to write a certificate of divorce, and to put her away.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">But Jesus said to them, »Because of your hardness of heart he wrote you this commandment.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But from the beginning of creation God made them male and female.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">For this reason a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="9">Therefore what God has joined together, let not man separate.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">In the house his disciples also asked him again about this matter.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">So he said to them, »Whoever divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery against her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And if she divorces her husband and marries another man, she commits adultery.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And they were bringing children to him, that he might touch them; but the disciples rebuked them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">But when Jesus saw it, he was indignant and said to them, »Let the little children come to me; and do not hinder them, for to such belongs the kingdom of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Truly, I say to you, whoever does not receive the kingdom of God like a little child will not enter it.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And he took them in his arms, put his hands on them and blessed them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And as he was setting out on his journey, a man ran up and knelt before him, and asked him, »Good Teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And Jesus said to him, »Why do you call me good? No one is good but God alone.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">You know the commandments: Do not murder, Do not commit adultery, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Do not defraud, Honor your father and mother.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And he said to him, »Teacher, all these I have observed from my youth.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Then Jesus, looking at him, loved him, and said to him, »You lack one thing; go and sell what you have, and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">But he fell sad at this word, and went away sorrowful, for he had great possessions.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Then Jesus looked around and said to his disciples, »How hard it is for those who have riches to enter the kingdom of God!«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And the disciples were amazed at his words. But Jesus said to them again, »Children, how hard it is to enter the kingdom of God!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And they were exceedingly astonished, and said to him, »Then who can be saved?«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Jesus looked at them and said, »With men it is impossible, but not with God; for all things are possible with God.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Peter began to say to him, »See, we have left everything and followed you.«</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="32">They were on the road, going up to Jerusalem, and Jesus was walking ahead of them; and they were amazed, and those who followed were afraid. And he took the twelve aside again and began to tell them what was to happen to him.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="37">And they said to him, »Grant us to sit, one at your right hand and the other at your left, in your glory.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">But Jesus said to them, »You do not know what you are asking. Can you drink the cup that I drink, or be baptized with the baptism I am baptized with?«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">They said to him, »We are able.« So Jesus said to them, »You will indeed drink the cup that I drink, and with the baptism I am baptized with you will be baptized;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">but to sit at my right hand or at my left is not mine to grant, but it is for those for whom it has been prepared.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">And when the ten heard it, they began to be indignant with James and John.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">But Jesus called them to himself and said to them, »You know that those who are considered rulers over the Gentiles lord it over them, and their great ones exercise authority over them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">But it shall not be so among you. But whoever wants to become great among you must be your servant,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="46">And they came to Jericho. And as he was leaving Jericho with his disciples and a great multitude, Bartimaeus, a blind man, the son of Timaeus, was sitting by the roadside begging.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">And when he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth, he began to cry out and say, »Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">Many rebuked him and told him to be quiet, but he cried out all the more, »Son of David, have mercy on me!«</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="50">And throwing aside his garment, he rose and came to Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="51">And Jesus said to him, »What do you want me to do for you?« And the blind man said to him, »Master, let me receive my sight.«</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="28">And one of the scribes came up and heard them disputing with one another, and seeing that he had answered them well, asked him, »Which commandment is the first of all?«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Jesus answered, »The first is: Hear, O Israel, the Lord our God is one Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind, and with all your strength.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">The second is this: You shall love your neighbor as yourself. There is no other commandment greater than these.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">And the scribe said to him, »You are right, Teacher; you have well said that God is one, and there is no other but he;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">and to love him with all the heart, and with all the understanding, and with all the strength, and to love one's neighbor as oneself, is much more than all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">And when Jesus saw that he answered wisely, he said to him, »You are not far from the kingdom of God.« And after that no one dared to ask him any question.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">And Jesus said, while he taught in the temple, »How is it that the scribes say that the Christ is the Son of David?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">David himself, speaking by the Holy Spirit, declared: <STYLE css="display:block;text-indent:5mm">The Lord said to my Lord:</STYLE><STYLE css="display:block;text-indent:5mm">»Sit at my right hand</STYLE><STYLE css="display:block;text-indent:10mm">till I put your enemies under your feet.«</STYLE></VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">Therefore David himself calls him Lord; how is he then his son?« And the common people heard him gladly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">And in his teaching he said, »Beware of the scribes, who like to go around in long robes, and to have salutations in the market places</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">and the best seats in the synagogues and the places of honor at feasts,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">who devour widows' houses and for a pretense make long prayers. They will receive the greater condemnation.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">And Jesus sat down opposite the treasury, and watched the multitude putting money into the treasury. Many people who were rich put in large sums.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">And a poor widow came, and put in two copper coins, which make a penny.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">And he called his disciples to him, and said to them, »Truly, I say to you, this poor widow has put in more than all those who are contributing to the treasury.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">For they all put in out of their abundance, but she out of her poverty put in everythingall she had to live on.«</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="13">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And as he came out of the temple, one of his disciples said to him, »Look, Teacher, what wonderful stones and what wonderful buildings!«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And Jesus said to him, »Do you see all these great buildings? There will not be left here one stone upon another, that will not be thrown down.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Now as he sat on the Mount of Olives opposite the temple, Peter, James, John, and Andrew asked him privately,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">»Tell us, when will this be? And what will be the sign when these things are all to be fulfilled?«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And Jesus began to say to them: »Take heed that no one deceives you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Many will come in my name, saying, I am he, and will deceive many.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">When you hear of wars and rumors of wars, do not be alarmed; such things must happen, but the end is not yet.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="14">
      <VERS vnumber="1">It was now two days before the Passover and the feast of Unleavened Bread. And the chief priests and the scribes were seeking how to arrest him by stealth, and kill him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">But they said, »Not during the feast, lest there be an uproar of the people.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And while he was at Bethany in the house of Simon the leper, as he sat at table, a woman came with an alabaster flask of ointment of pure nard, very costly. And she broke the flask and poured it over his head.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">But there were some who said to themselves indignantly, »Why was this ointment wasted?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">For it might have been sold for more than three hundred denarii and given to the poor.« And they criticized her sharply.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But Jesus said, »Let her alone. Why do you trouble her? She has done a beautiful thing to me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">For you always have the poor with you, and whenever you will, you can do good to them; but you will not always have me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">She has done what she could. She has come beforehand to anoint my body for burial.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And truly, I say to you, wherever the gospel is preached in the whole world, what she has done will also be told in memory of her.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Then Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve, went to the chief priests to betray him to them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And when they heard it they were glad, and promised to give him money. So he sought an opportunity to betray him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Now on the first day of Unleavened Bread, when they killed the Passover lamb, his disciples said to him, »Where do you want us to go and prepare for you to eat the Passover?«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And he sent two of his disciples, and said to them, »Go into the city, and a man carrying a jar of water will meet you; follow him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And wherever he enters, say to the owner of the house, The Teacher says, where is my guest room, where I may eat the Passover with my disciples?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">He will show you a large upper room, furnished and ready; make preparations for us there.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">So the disciples set out and went to the city, and found it just as he had told them; and they prepared the Passover.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And when it was evening he came with the twelve.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And as they were at table eating, Jesus said, »Truly, I say to you, one of you will betray me, one who is eating with me.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">They began to be sorrowful, and to say to him one by one, »Is it I?«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">He said to them, »It is one of the twelve, one who dips bread into the dish with me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">For the Son of Man goes just as it is written of him, but woe to that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed! It would have been better for that man if he had not been born.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And as they were eating, Jesus took bread, blessed and broke it, and gave it to them and said, »Take; this is my body.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Then he took the cup, and when he had given thanks he gave it to them, and they all drank from it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And he said to them, »This is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Truly, I say to you, I will not drink of the fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it new in the kingdom of God.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And when they had sung a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And Jesus said to them, »You will all fall away; for it is written: <STYLE css="display:block;text-indent:5mm">I will strike the shepherd,</STYLE><STYLE css="display:block;text-indent:10mm">and the sheep will be scattered.</STYLE></VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">But after I have been raised, I will go before you to Galilee.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Peter said to him, »Even if all fall away, I will not.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Jesus said to him, »Truly, I say to you that this very night, before the rooster crows twice, you will deny me three times.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">But he spoke more vehemently, »If I have to die with you, I will not deny you!« And they all said the same.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">They went to a place which was called Gethsemane; and he said to his disciples, »Sit here, while I pray.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">And he took Peter, James and John with him, and he began to be deeply distressed and troubled.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">And he said to them, »My soul is very sorrowful, even to death; stay here, and watch.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">And going a little farther, he fell on the ground and prayed that, if it were possible, the hour might pass from him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">And he said, »Abba, Father, all things are possible for you. Take this cup away from me; yet not what I will, but what you will.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">Then he came and found them sleeping, and he said to Peter, »Simon, are you asleep? Could you not watch one hour?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">Watch and pray that you may not enter into temptation. The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">And again he went away and prayed, saying the same words.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">And when he came again, he found them sleeping, for their eyes were heavy; and they did not know what to answer him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">Then he came the third time and said to them, »Are you still sleeping and resting? It is enough! The hour has come; behold, the Son of Man is being betrayed into the hands of sinners.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">Rise, let us go; see, my betrayer is at hand.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">And immediately, while he was still speaking, Judas came, one of the twelve, and with him a crowd with swords and clubs, from the chief priests and the scribes and the elders.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">Now the betrayer had given them a signal, saying, »The one I shall kiss is the man; seize him and lead him away under guard.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">And when he came, he went up to him at once, and said, »Rabbi!« and he kissed him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">And they laid hands on him and seized him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">And one of those who stood by drew his sword and struck the servant of the high priest, and cut off his ear.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">And Jesus said to them, »Have you come out as against a robber, with swords and clubs to capture me?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">Every day I was with you in the temple teaching, and you did not seize me. But the scriptures must be fulfilled.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">Then they all forsook him and fled.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="51">And a young man followed him, with nothing but a linen cloth around his body. And they seized him,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="52">and he left the linen cloth and fled from them naked.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="53">And they led Jesus to the high priest; and all the chief priests and the elders and the scribes were assembled.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="54">But Peter followed him at a distance, right into the courtyard of the high priest. And he sat with the guards and warmed himself at the fire.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="55">Now the chief priests and the whole council sought testimony against Jesus to put him to death, but they found none.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="56">For many bore false witness against him, but their testimonies did not agree.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="57">Then some stood up and bore false witness against him, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="58">»We heard him say, I will destroy this temple that is made with hands, and in three days I will build another not made with hands.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="59">Yet even then their testimony did not agree.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="60">And the high priest stood up in the midst, and asked Jesus, »Have you no answer to make? What is it that these men testify against you?«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="61">But he was silent and made no answer. Again the high priest asked him, »Are you the Christ, the Son of the Blessed?«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="62">And Jesus said, »I am. <STYLE css="display:block;text-indent:5mm">And you will see the Son of Man</STYLE><STYLE css="display:block;text-indent:10mm">sitting at the right hand of the Power,</STYLE><STYLE css="display:block;text-indent:10mm">and coming with the clouds of heaven.«</STYLE></VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="63">The high priest tore his clothes and said, »Why do we need any more witnesses?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="64">You have heard the blasphemy. What do you think?« And they all condemned him as worthy of death.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="65">Then some began to spit on him, and to blindfold him, and to beat him, and to say to him, »Prophesy!« And the guards received him with slaps in the face.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="66">Now as Peter was below in the courtyard, one of the servant girls of the high priest came.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="67">And when she saw Peter warming himself, she looked at him, and said, »You also were with the Nazarene, Jesus.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="68">But he denied it, saying, »I neither know nor understand what you mean.« And he went out into the gateway.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="69">And the servant girl saw him again, and began to say to those who stood by, »This is one of them.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="70">But again he denied it. And after a little while again those standing near said to Peter, »Surely you are one of them; for you are a Gallilean.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="71">But he began to invoke a curse on himself and to swear, »I do not know this man of whom you speak.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="72">And immediately the rooster crowed a second time. Then Peter remembered the word Jesus had said to him, »Before the rooster crows twice, you will deny me three times.« And he broke down and wept.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="15">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Very early in the morning, the chief priests held a consultation with the elders and scribes and the whole council; and they bound Jesus, led him away, and delivered him to Pilate.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Then Pilate asked him, »Are you the King of the Jews?« And he answered him, »It is as you say.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And the chief priests accused him of many things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And Pilate again asked him, »Have you no answer to make? See how many things they bring against you.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">But Jesus still made no answer, so that Pilate was amazed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Now at the feast he was accustomed to release for them one prisoner whom they requested.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And with the rebels in prison, who had committed murder in the insurrection, there was a man called Barabbas.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And the crowd came up and began to ask Pilate to do as he had always done for them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">But Pilate answered them, »Do you want me to release to you the King of the Jews?«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">For he knew it was out of envy that the chief priests had handed Jesus over to him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">But the chief priests stirred up the crowd to have him release for them Barabbas instead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And Pilate again said to them, »Then what shall I do with the man whom you call the King of the Jews?«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And they cried out again, »Crucify him!«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And Pilate said to them, »Why, what evil has he done?« But they shouted all the more, »Crucify him!«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">So Pilate, wanting to satisfy the crowd, released Barabbas to them; and he delivered Jesus, after he had scourged him, to be crucified.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">The soldiers led him away into the palace (that is, the Praetorium) and they called together the whole battalion.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And they clothed him in a purple cloak, and they twisted a crown of thorns and put it on him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And they began to salute him, »Hail, King of the Jews!«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Then they struck him on the head with a reed and spat on him; and falling on their knees, they paid homage to him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And when they had mocked him, they took the purple robe off him, and put his own clothes on him. Then they led him out to crucify him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Then they compelled a certain man, Simon of Cyrene, the father of Alexander and Rufus, as he was coming out of the country and passing by, to carry his cross.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And they brought him to the place called Golgotha (which means the place of a skull).</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Then they offered him wine mingled with myrrh, but he did not take it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And when they crucified him, <STYLE css="display:block;text-indent:5mm">they divided his garments,</STYLE><STYLE css="display:block;text-indent:10mm">casting lots for them</STYLE><STYLE css="display:block;text-indent:15mm">to determine what each man should take.</STYLE></VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And it was the third hour, when they crucified him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And the inscription of the charge written against him read: <STYLE css="display:block;text-align:center">THE KING OF THE JEWS.</STYLE></VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And with him they crucified two robbers, one on his right and one on his left.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">
      </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And those who passed by hurled insults at him, wagging their heads, and saying, »Aha! You who would destroy the temple and build it in three days,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">save yourself, and come down from the cross!«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">So also the chief priests mocked him among themselves with the scribes, and said, »He saved others; he cannot save himself.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">Let the Christ, the King of Israel, come down now from the cross, that we may see and believe.« Those who were crucified with him also reviled him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">And when the sixth hour had come, there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">And at the ninth hour Jesus cried out with a loud voice, »Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?«which means, »My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">When some of those standing near heard this, they said, »Behold, he is calling Elijah.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">And one ran and filled a sponge full of wine vinegar, put it on a reed, and offered it to him to drink, saying, »Wait, let us see if Elijah will come to take him down.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">And with a loud cry, Jesus breathed his last.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">Then the veil of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">So when the centurion, who stood opposite him, saw that he cried out like this and breathed his last, he said, »Truly this man was the Son of God!«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">There were also women looking on from afar, among whom were Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James the younger and of Joses, and Salome,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="42">Now when evening had come, because it was the Preparation Day, that is, the day before the Sabbath,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">Joseph of Arimathea, a prominent council member, who was himself waiting for the kingdom of God, coming and taking courage, went in to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">Pilate marveled that he was already dead; and summoning the centurion, he asked him if he was already dead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">And when he learned from the centurion that he was dead, he granted the body to Joseph.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">Then he bought fine linen, took him down, and wrapped him in the linen. And he laid him in a tomb which had been hewn out of the rock, and rolled a stone against the door of the tomb.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses saw where he was laid.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="16">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now when the Sabbath was past, Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James, and Salome bought spices, so that they might go and anoint him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And very early on the first day of the week, they came to the tomb when the sun had risen.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And they asked each other, »Who will roll away the stone from the door of the tomb for us?«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">But when they looked up, they saw that the stone, though it was very large, had been rolled away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And entering the tomb, they saw a young man sitting on the right side, dressed in a white robe; and they were alarmed.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="32">He will be great, and will be called the Son of the Most High; and the Lord God will give him the throne of his father David.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="8">When Simon Peter saw it, he fell down at Jesus' knees, saying, »Depart from me, for I am a sinful man, O Lord!«</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="12">While he was in one of the cities, a man who was full of leprosy saw Jesus; and he fell on his face and begged him, »Lord, if you are willing, you can make me clean.«</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="20">When he saw their faith he said, »Man, your sins are forgiven you.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And the scribes and the Pharisees began to reason, saying, »Who is this who speaks blasphemies? Who can forgive sins but God alone?«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">But when Jesus perceived their thoughts, he answered them, »Why are you reasoning in your hearts?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Which is easier, to say, Your sins are forgiven you, or to say, Rise up and walk?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins«he said to the man who was paralyzed »I say to you, rise, take up your bed and go home.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Immediately he rose up before them, took up what he had been lying on, and went home, glorifying God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And they were all amazed, and they glorified God and were filled with awe, saying, »We have seen strange things today.«</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="32">I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">They said to him, »The disciples of John fast often and offer prayers, and so do the disciples of the Pharisees, but yours eat and drink.«</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="35">But the days will come when the bridegroom will be taken away from them; then they will fast in those days.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">He told them a parable also: »No one tears a piece from a new garment and puts it on an old one; if he does, he will tear the new garment, and the piece from the new will not match the old.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">And no one puts new wine into old wineskins; if he does, the new wine will burst the skins and it will be spilled, and the skins will be ruined.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="4">And when they came to Jesus, they begged him earnestly, saying, »He is worthy to have you do this for him,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">for he loves our nation, and has built us our synagogue.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And Jesus went with them. When he was not far from the house, the centurion sent friends to him, saying to him, »Lord, do not trouble yourself, for I am not worthy to have you come under my roof.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Therefore I did not even consider myself worthy to come to you. But say the word, and my servant will be healed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">For I am a man set under authority, with soldiers under me. And I say to one, Go, and he goes; and to another, Come, and he comes; and to my servant, Do this, and he does it.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">When Jesus heard this, he marveled at him, and turned and said to the crowd that followed him, »I tell you, I have not found such great faith even in Israel.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And when those who had been sent returned to the house, they found the servant well.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Soon afterward, he went to a city called Nain, and his disciples and a large crowd went along with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">As he came near the gate of the city, behold, a dead man was being carried out, the only son of his mother; and she was a widow. And a large crowd from the city was with her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">When the Lord saw her, he had compassion on her and said to her, »Do not weep.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Then he came and touched the open coffin, and those who carried him stood still. And he said, »Young man, I say to you, arise.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">The dead man sat up, and began to speak. And he gave him to his mother.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Fear seized them all; and they glorified God, saying, »A great prophet has arisen among us;« and »God has visited his people.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And this report about him spread throughout all Judea and all the surrounding country.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Then the disciples of John told him about all these things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And John, calling to him two of his disciples, sent them to the Lord, saying, »Are you the One who is to come, or shall we look for another?«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">When the men had come to him, they said, »John the Baptist has sent us to you, saying, Are you the One who is to come, or shall we look for another?«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">At that very hour he cured many of diseases and afflictions and evil spirits, and to many that were blind he gave sight.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">He answered them, »Go and tell John what you have seen and heard: the blind receive their sight, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, and the deaf hear, the dead are raised up, the poor have the good news preached to them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And blessed is he who is not offended because of me.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">When the messengers of John had departed, he began to speak to the crowds concerning John: »What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken by the wind?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">What then did you go out to see? A man clothed in soft clothing? Behold, those who are gorgeously appareled and live in luxury are in kings' courts.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">But what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and more than a prophet.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">This is he of whom it is written: <STYLE css="display:block;text-indent:5mm">Behold, I send my messenger before your face,</STYLE><STYLE css="display:block;text-indent:10mm">who will prepare your way before you.</STYLE></VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">I tell you, among those born of women there is no one greater than John; yet the one who is least in the kingdom of God is greater than he.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">(And when they heard him, all the people, even the tax collectors, justified God, having been baptized with the baptism of John.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">But the Pharisees and the lawyers rejected the purpose of God for themselves, not having been baptized by him.)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">»To what then shall I compare the men of this generation, and what are they like?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">They are like children sitting in the marketplace and calling to one another: <STYLE css="display:block;text-indent:5mm">We played the flute for you, and you did not dance;</STYLE><STYLE css="display:block;text-indent:10mm">we sang a dirge, and you did not weep.</STYLE></VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">For John the Baptist came neither eating bread nor drinking wine, and you say, He has a demon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">The Son of Man has come eating and drinking, and you say, Behold, a glutton and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">But wisdom is justified by all her children.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">One of the Pharisees asked him to eat with him, and he went to the Pharisee's house, and reclined at the table.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">And behold, a woman of the city, who was a sinner, when she learned that Jesus was reclining at the table in the Pharisee's house, brought an alabaster flask of perfume,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">and as she stood behind him at his feet, weeping, she began to wet his feet with her tears, and wiped them with the hair of her head, and kissed his feet, and anointed them with the perfume.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">Now when the Pharisee who had invited him saw it, he said to himself, »If this man were a prophet, he would have known who and what sort of woman this is who is touching him, for she is a sinner.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">And Jesus answered him, »Simon, I have something to say to you.« And he said, »Teacher, say it.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">»A certain creditor had two debtors. One owed five hundred denarii, and the other fifty.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">When they had nothing with which to pay him back, he freely forgave them both. Now which of them will love him more?«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">Simon answered, »I suppose the one to whom he forgave more.« And he said to him, »You have judged rightly.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">Then he turned toward the woman and said to Simon, »Do you see this woman? I entered your house; you gave me no water for my feet, but she has wet my feet with her tears and wiped them with the hair of her head.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">You gave me no kiss, but this woman has not ceased to kiss my feet from the time I came in.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">You did not anoint my head with oil, but she has anointed my feet with perfume.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">Therefore I tell you, her sins, which are many, are forgiven, for she loved much. But he who is forgiven little, loves little.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">And he said to her, »Your sins are forgiven.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">Then those who reclined at the table with him began to say among themselves, »Who is this who even forgives sins?«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">He said to the woman, »Your faith has saved you; go in peace.«</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="8">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Soon afterward, he went on through every city and village, preaching and bringing the good news of the kingdom of God. And the twelve were with him,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">and also some women who had been healed of evil spirits and infirmities: Mary, called Magdalene, from whom seven demons had come out,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">and Joanna the wife of Chuza, Herod's steward, and Susanna, and many others who provided for them out of their means.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And when a great crowd came together and people from town after town came to him, he said in a parable:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">»A sower went out to sow his seed. And as he sowed, some fell along the path; and it was trampled down, and the birds of the air devoured it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Some fell on the rock; and as it grew up, it withered away, because it had no moisture.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And some fell among thorns, and the thorns grew up with it and choked it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">But others fell on good soil, sprang up, and yielded a crop a hundredfold.« When he had said this he called out, »He who has ears to hear, let him hear!«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">When his disciples asked him what this parable meant,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">he said, »To you it has been given to know the secrets of the kingdom of God; but to others it is given in parables, so that <STYLE css="display:block;text-indent:5mm">Seeing they may not see,</STYLE><STYLE css="display:block;text-indent:10mm">and hearing they may not understand.</STYLE></VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">»Now the parable is this: The seed is the word of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">The ones along the path are those who hear; then the devil comes and takes away the word from their hearts, that they may not believe and be saved.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And the ones on the rock are those who, when they hear the word, receive it with joy; but these have no root, they believe for a while and in time of temptation fall away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And the ones that fell among the thorns, they are those who hear, but as they go on their way they are choked by the cares and riches and pleasures of life, and their fruit does not mature.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">But the ones that fell on the good soil are those who, having heard the word with a noble and good heart, keep it and bear fruit with patience.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">»No one, when he has lit a lamp, covers it with a vessel or puts it under a bed, but puts it on a lampstand, that those who enter may see the light.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">For nothing is secret that will not be revealed, nor anything hidden that will not be known and come to light.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Therefore take heed how you hear. For whoever has, to him more will be given; and whoever does not have, even what he thinks he has will be taken from him.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Then his mother and his brothers came to him, but they could not reach him because of the crowd.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And it was told him, »Your mother and your brothers are standing outside, desiring to see you.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">But he said to them, »My mother and my brothers are those who hear the word of God and do it.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">One day he got into a boat with his disciples, and he said to them, »Let us go over to the other side of the lake.« So they set out.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">As they sailed he fell asleep. And a windstorm came down on the lake, and they were filling with water, and were in danger.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And they went and woke him, saying, »Master, Master, we are perishing!« Then he awoke and rebuked the wind and the raging waves; and they ceased, and there was a calm.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">He said to them, »Where is your faith?« And they were afraid, and they marveled, saying to one another, »Who then is this, that he commands even the winds and water, and they obey him?«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Then they sailed to the country of the Gerasenes, which is opposite Galilee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">When he stepped out on land, there met him a man from the city who had demons. For a long time he had worn no clothes, and he lived not in a house but in the tombs.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">When he saw Jesus, he cried out and fell down before him, and said with a loud voice, »What have you to do with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I beg you, do not torment me!«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">For he had commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the man. For many times it had seized him, and he was kept under guard, bound with chains and shackles; and he broke the bonds and was driven by the demon into the wilderness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Jesus asked him, »What is your name?« And he said, »Legion«; because many demons had entered him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">And they begged him repeatedly not to command them to go into the Abyss.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">Now a large herd of swine was feeding there on the hillside; and they begged him to let them enter them. So he gave them permission.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">Then the demons came out of the man and entered the swine, and the herd rushed down the steep bank into the lake and were drowned.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">When those tending the pigs saw what had happened, they fled, and told it in the city and in the country.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">Then people went out to see what had happened, and they came to Jesus, and found the man from whom the demons had gone, sitting at the feet of Jesus, clothed and in his right mind; and they were afraid.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">Those who had seen it told them how he who had been demon-possessed was healed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">Then all the people of the surrounding region of the Gerasenes asked him to depart from them, for they were seized with great fear. So he got into the boat and returned.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">The man from whom the demons had gone begged that he might be with him; but Jesus sent him away, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">»Return to your home, and tell how much God has done for you.« And he went away, proclaiming throughout the whole city how much Jesus had done for him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">Now when Jesus returned, the crowd welcomed him, for they were all waiting for him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">And behold, there came a man named Jairus, who was a ruler of the synagogue; and he fell at Jesus' feet and begged him to come to his house,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">for he had an only daughter, about twelve years of age, and she was dying. <STYLE css="display:block;text-indent:5mm">But as he went, the people pressed round him.</STYLE></VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">And a woman who had a flow of blood for twelve years and could not be healed by anyone,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">came up behind him, and touched the fringe of his garment; and immediately her flow of blood stopped.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">And Jesus said, »Who touched me?« When all denied it, Peter said, »Master, the multitudes surround you and press upon you!«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">But Jesus said, »Someone touched me; for I know that power has gone out from me.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">When the woman saw that she was not hidden, she came trembling, and falling down before him declared in the presence of all the people why she had touched him, and how she had been immediately healed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">And he said to her, »Daughter, your faith has made you well; go in peace.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">While he was still speaking, someone came from the ruler of the synagogue's house and said, »Your daughter is dead; do not trouble the Teacher any more.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">But Jesus on hearing this answered him, »Do not be afraid; only believe, and she will be well.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="51">When he came into the house he permitted no one to go in with him except Peter, James, and John, and the father and mother of the girl.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="52">Now all were wailing and mourning for her; but he said, »Do not weep; she is not dead, but sleeping.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="53">And they laughed at him, knowing that she was dead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="54">But he took her by the hand and called, saying, »Child, arise.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="55">Then her spirit returned, and she got up at once. And he directed that something should be given her to eat.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="56">And her parents were astonished, but he charged them to tell no one what had happened.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="9">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Then he called the twelve together and gave them power and authority over all demons, and to cure diseases.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And he sent them out to preach the kingdom of God and to heal the sick.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And he said to them, »Take nothing for the journey, no staff, nor bag, nor bread, nor money; and do not have two tunics.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Whatever house you enter, stay there, and from there depart.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And wherever they do not receive you, when you leave that town, shake off the dust from your feet as a testimony against them.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">So they departed and went through the towns, preaching the gospel and healing everywhere.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Now Herod the tetrarch heard of all that was done; and he was perplexed, because it was said by some that John had been raised from the dead,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">by some that Elijah had appeared, and by others that one of the old prophets had risen again.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And Herod said, »John I have beheaded, but who is this about whom I hear such things?« So he sought to see him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And when the apostles returned, they told him what they had done. Then he took them with him and withdrew apart to a city called Bethsaida.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">But when the crowds learned it, they followed him; and he welcomed them and spoke to them about the kingdom of God, and healed those who had need of healing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Now the day began to wear away; and the twelve came and said to him, »Send the crowd away, to go to the surrounding villages and country, to lodge and get provisions; for we are here in a deserted place.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">But he said to them, »You give them something to eat.« And they said, »We have no more than five loaves and two fishunless we go and buy food for all these people.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">For there were about five thousand men. And he said to his disciples, »Make them sit down in groups of about fifty each.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And they did so, and made them all sit down.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Taking the five loaves and the two fish and looking up to heaven, he blessed and broke them, and gave them to the disciples to set before the people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">They all ate and were satisfied, and they took up twelve baskets of broken pieces that were left over.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Now it happened that as he was praying alone his disciples were with him; and he asked them, »Who do the crowds say that I am?«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">So they answered, »John the Baptist; but others say Elijah; and others say that one of the old prophets has risen again.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And he said to them, »But who do you say that I am?« And Peter answered, »The Christ of God.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">But he strictly warned and commanded them to tell this to no one,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">saying, »The Son of Man must suffer many things, and be rejected by the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and on the third day be raised.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Then he said to them all, »If anyone would come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">For whoever desires to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for my sake will save it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">For what profit is it to a man if he gains the whole world, and loses or forfeits himself?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">For whoever is ashamed of me and of my words, of him will the Son of Man be ashamed when he comes in his glory and in the glory of the Father and of the holy angels.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">But I tell you truly, there are some standing here who will not taste death before they see the kingdom of God.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Now about eight days after these sayings, he took with him Peter and John and James, and went up on the mountain to pray.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And as he was praying, the appearance of his face was altered, and his robe became white and glistening.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And behold, two men talked with him, Moses and Elijah,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">who appeared in glory and spoke of his departure, which he was about to accomplish at Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">But Peter and those with him were heavy with sleep; and when they were fully awake, they saw his glory and the two men who stood with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">As the men were parting from him, Peter said to Jesus, »Master, it is good for us to be here; and let us make three tabernacles: one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah«not knowing what he said.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">While he was saying this, a cloud came and overshadowed them; and they were afraid as they entered the cloud.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">And a voice came out of the cloud, saying, »This is my Son, my Chosen; listen to him!«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">When the voice had spoken, Jesus was found alone. But they kept quiet, and told no one in those days any of the things they had seen.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">On the next day, when they had come down from the mountain, a great crowd met him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">And behold, a man from the crowd cried out, »Teacher, I beg you to look upon my son, for he is my only child.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">And behold, a spirit seizes him, and he suddenly cries out; it convulses him so that he foams at the mouth, and will hardly leave him, bruising him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">I begged your disciples to cast it out, but they could not.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">Then Jesus answered, »O faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you and bear with you? Bring your son here.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">While he was coming, the demon threw him and convulsed him. But Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, and healed the boy, and gave him back to his father.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">And they were all amazed at the majesty of God. <STYLE css="display:block;text-indent:5mm">But while everyone was marveling at all that Jesus did, he said to his disciples,</STYLE></VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">»Let these words sink into your ears, for the Son of Man is about to be betrayed into the hands of men.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">But they did not understand this saying, and it was hidden from them so that they did not perceive it; and they were afraid to ask him about this saying.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">And an argument arose among them as to which of them would be the greatest.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">Jesus, perceiving the thought of their heart, took a little child and set him by him,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">and said to them, »Whoever receives this little child in my name receives me, and whoever receives me receives him who sent me. For he who is least among you all is the one who is great.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">Now John answered, »Master, we saw a man casting out demons in your name, and we forbade him because he does not follow with us.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">But Jesus said to him, »Do not forbid him, for he that is not against you is for you.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="51">When the time drew near for him to be received up, he set his face to go to Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="52">And he sent messengers on ahead, who went and entered a village of the Samaritans, to make ready for him;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="53">but the people did not receive him, because his face was set for Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="54">And when his disciples James and John saw this, they said, »Lord, do you want us to command fire to come down from heaven and consume them?«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="55">But he turned and rebuked them,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="56">and they went on to another village.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="57">As they were going along the road, a man said to him, »I will follow you wherever you go.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="58">And Jesus said to him, »Foxes have holes and birds of the air have nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="59">To another he said, »Follow me.« But he said, »Lord, let me first go and bury my father.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="60">Jesus said to him, »Let the dead bury their own dead, but you go and proclaim the kingdom of God.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="61">Still another said, »I will follow you, Lord; but first let me go back and say farewell to those at my home.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="62">Jesus said to him, »No one who puts his hand to the plow and looks back is fit for the kingdom of God.«</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="10">
      <VERS vnumber="1">After this the Lord appointed seventy others, and sent them ahead of him, two by two, into every town and place where he himself was about to go.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And he said to them, »The harvest is plentiful, but the laborers are few; pray therefore the Lord of the harvest to send out laborers into his harvest.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Go your way; behold, I send you out as lambs among wolves.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="31">At that very time some Pharisees came, and said to him, »Get away from here, for Herod wants to kill you.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">And he said to them, »Go and tell that fox, Behold, I cast out demons and perform cures today and tomorrow, and the third day I finish my course.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">Nevertheless I must journey today and tomorrow, and the day following; for it cannot be that a prophet should perish outside of Jerusalem.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="14">
      <VERS vnumber="1">One Sabbath, when he went to dine at the house of a ruler who belonged to the Pharisees, they watched him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And behold, there was a man before him who had dropsy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And Jesus spoke to the lawyers and Pharisees, saying, »Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath, or not?«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">But they kept silent. And he took him and healed him, and let him go.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Then he said to them, »Which of you, having a son or an ox that has fallen into a well, will not immediately pull him out on the Sabbath day?«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And they could not reply to this.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">So he told a parable to those who were invited, when he noted how they chose the places of honor, saying to them:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">»When you are invited by anyone to a wedding feast, do not sit down in a place of honor, lest one more distinguished than you be invited by him;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">and he who invited you both will come and say to you, Give place to this man, and then you will begin with shame to take the lowest place.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">But when you are invited, go and sit in the lowest place, so that when your host comes he may say to you, Friend, go up higher. Then you will be honored in the presence of all who sit at table with you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, and he who humbles himself will be exalted.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Then he also said to the one who invited him, »When you give a luncheon or a dinner, do not invite your friends or your brothers, your relatives or rich neighbors, lest they also invite you back, and you be repaid.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">But when you give a feast, invite the poor, the maimed, the lame, the blind,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">and you will be blessed, because they cannot repay you. You will be repaid at the resurrection of the just.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">When one of those who sat at table with him heard this, he said to him, »Blessed is he who shall eat bread in the kingdom of God!«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Then he said to him, »A certain man gave a great banquet and invited many.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And at the time of the banquet he sent his servant to say to those who had been invited, Come, for all is now ready.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">But they all alike began to make excuses. The first said to him, I have bought a field, and I must go out and see it. I ask you to have me excused.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And another said, I have bought five yoke of oxen, and I am going to test them. I ask you to have me excused.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Still another said, I have married a wife, and therefore I cannot come.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">So the servant came back and reported this to his master. Then the owner of the house became angry and said to his servant, Go out quickly into the streets and lanes of the city and bring in the poor and the maimed, the blind and the lame.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And the servant said, Sir, what you commanded has been done, and still there is room.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Then the master said to the servant, Go out into the highways and hedges, and compel them to come in, that my house may be filled.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">For I tell you, none of those men who were invited shall taste my banquet.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Now great multitudes went with him; and he turned and said to them,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">»If any one comes to me and does not hate his own father and mother, wife and children, brothers and sisters, yes, and even his own life, he cannot be my disciple.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And whoever does not bear his cross and come after me cannot be my disciple.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">For which of you, intending to build a tower, does not sit down first and count the cost, whether he has enough to complete it?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Otherwise, when he has laid the foundation, and is not able to finish, all who see it begin to mock him,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">saying, This man began to build, and was not able to finish.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Or what king, going to make war against another king, will not sit down first and consider whether he is able with ten thousand to meet him who comes against him with twenty thousand?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">And if not, while the other is still a great way off, he sends a delegation and asks terms of peace.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">So likewise, whoever of you does not give up all that he has cannot be my disciple.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Salt is good; but if the salt has lost its taste, how shall it be seasoned?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">It is neither fit for the land nor for the dunghill; men throw it out. He who has ears to hear, let him hear!«</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="15">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now the tax collectors and sinners were all drawing near to hear him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And the Pharisees and the scribes murmured, saying, »This man receives sinners and eats with them.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">So he told them this parable:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">»What man of you, having a hundred sheep, if he loses one of them, does not leave the ninety-nine in the wilderness, and go after the one which is lost until he finds it?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And when he has found it, he lays it on his shoulders, rejoicing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And when he comes home, he calls together his friends and neighbors, saying to them, Rejoice with me, for I have found my sheep which was lost.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">I tell you that in the same way there will be more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety-nine righteous persons who need no repentance.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">»Or what woman, having ten silver coins, if she loses one coin, does not light a lamp and sweep the house and search carefully until she finds it?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And when she has found it, she calls together her friends and neighbors, saying, Rejoice with me, for I have found the coin which I had lost.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">In the same way, I tell you, there is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner who repents.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Then he said: »There was a man who had two sons.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And the younger of them said to his father, Father, give me the share of property that falls to me. So he divided his living between them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Not many days after, the younger son gathered together all he had and took his journey into a far country, and there he squandered his property in loose living.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And when he had spent everything, there arose a severe famine in that country, and he began to be in want.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">So he went and joined himself to a citizen of that country, who sent him into his fields to feed swine.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And he would gladly have filled his stomach with the pods that the swine ate, and no one gave him anything.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">But when he came to himself, he said, How many of my father's hired servants have bread enough and to spare, and here I perish with hunger!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">I will arise and go to my father and will say to him, »Father, I have sinned against heaven and before you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">I am no longer worthy to be called your son; make me like one of your hired servants.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And he arose and came to his father. But while he was still a great way off, his father saw him and had compassion for him, and ran and fell on his neck and kissed him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And the son said to him, Father, I have sinned against heaven and before you; I am no longer worthy to be called your son.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">But the father said to his servants, Bring out the best robe and put it on him, and put a ring on his hand and sandals on his feet.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And bring the fatted calf and kill it, and let us eat and be merry;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">for this my son was dead and is alive again; he was lost and is found. And they began to be merry.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">»Now his older son was in the field. And as he came and drew near to the house, he heard music and dancing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">So he called one of the servants and asked what these things meant.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And he said to him, Your brother has come, and your father has killed the fatted calf, because he has received him safe and sound.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">But he was angry and refused to go in. So his father came out and pleaded with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">But he answered his father, Behold, these many years I have been serving you, and I never disobeyed your command; yet you never gave me a young goat, that I might make merry with my friends.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">But when this son of yours came, who has devoured your living with harlots, you killed for him the fatted calf!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">And he said to him, Son, you are always with me, and all that I have is yours.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">It was right that we should make merry and be glad, for this your brother was dead, and is alive again; he was lost, and is found.«</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="16">
      <VERS vnumber="1">He also said to his disciples: »There was a certain rich man who had a steward, and an accusation was brought to him that this man was wasting his goods.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">So he called him and said to him, What is this I hear about you? Give an account of your stewardship, for you can no longer be steward.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">The steward said to himself, What shall I do, since my master is taking the stewardship away from me? I am not strong enough to dig, and I am ashamed to beg.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">I have decided what to do, so that people may receive me into their houses when I am put out of the stewardship.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">So he called in each one of his master's debtors, and he said to the first, How much do you owe my master?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And he said, A hundred measures of oil. So he said to him, Take your bill, and sit down quickly and write fifty.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Then he said to another, And how much do you owe? And he said, A hundred measures of wheat. He said to him, Take your bill, and write eighty.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">So the master commended the dishonest steward because he had dealt shrewdly. For the sons of this world are more shrewd in dealing with their own generation than the sons of light.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And I tell you, make friends for yourselves by means of unrighteous mammon, so that when it fails, they may receive you into the eternal dwellings.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">He who is faithful in a very little is faithful also in much; and he who is dishonest in a very little is dishonest also in much.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">If then you have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon, who will trust you with the true riches?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And if you have not been faithful in what is another's, who will give you what is your own?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">No servant can serve two masters; for either he will hate the one and love the other, or else he will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and mammon.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">The Pharisees, who were lovers of money, heard all this, and they scoffed at him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">He said to them, »You are those who justify yourselves before men, but God knows your hearts. For what is highly esteemed among men is an abomination in the sight of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">The law and the prophets were until John. Since that time the good news of the kingdom of God is preached, and everyone is forcing his way into it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">But it is easier for heaven and earth to pass away, than for one dot of the law to fail.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Everyone who divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery, and he who marries a woman divorced from her husband commits adultery.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">»There was a certain rich man who was clothed in purple and fine linen and feasted sumptuously every day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And a certain beggar named Lazarus was laid at his gate, full of sores,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">longing to be fed with what fell from the rich man's table. Moreover the dogs came and licked his sores.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">So the beggar died, and was carried by the angels to Abraham's bosom. The rich man also died and was buried.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And in Hades, being in torment, he lifted up his eyes, and saw Abraham far off and Lazarus in his bosom.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And he called out, Father Abraham, have mercy upon me, and send Lazarus to dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue; for I am in agony in this flame.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">But Abraham said, Son, remember that in your lifetime you received your good things, and Lazarus received evil things; but now he is comforted here and you are in agony.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And besides all this, between us and you a great chasm has been fixed, so that those who want to pass from here to you cannot, nor can anyone cross over from there to us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And he said,  Then I beg you, father, to send him to my father's house,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">for I have five brothers, so that he may warn them, lest they also come to this place of torment.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Abraham said to him, They have Moses and the prophets; let them hear them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And he said, No, father Abraham; but if someone goes to them from the dead, they will repent.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">He said to him, If they do not hear Moses and the prophets, neither will they be convinced if some one should rise from the dead.«</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Then he said to his disciples, »Things that cause people to sin are bound to come, but woe to him through whom they do come!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">It would be better for him if a millstone were hung round his neck and he were thrown into the sea, than that he should cause one of these little ones to sin.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="4">And if he sins against you seven times in a day, and turns to you seven times, and says, I repent, you must forgive him.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">The apostles said to the Lord, »Increase our faith!«</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="11">On the way to Jerusalem he was passing along between Samaria and Galilee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">As he entered a village, ten men who were lepers met him, who stood at a distance.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And they lifted up their voices and said, »Jesus, Master, have mercy on us!«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">When he saw them, he said to them, »Go, show yourselves to the priests.« And as they went, they were cleansed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Then one of them, when he saw that he was healed, turned back, praising God with a loud voice;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">and he fell on his face at Jesus feet, giving him thanks. And he was a Samaritan.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Then said Jesus, »Were not ten cleansed? Where are the nine?</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="19">And he said to him, »Rise and go your way; your faith has made you well.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Now when he was asked by the Pharisees when the kingdom of God would come, he answered them, »The kingdom of God does not come with observation;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">nor will they say, Look, here it is! or There! for behold, the kingdom of God is within you.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Then he said to the disciples, »The days are coming when you will desire to see one of the days of the Son of Man, and you will not see it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And they will say to you, Look here! or Look there! Do not go after them or follow them.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="18">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Then he told them a parable, to show that they ought always to pray and not lose heart.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">He said: »In a certain city there was a judge who neither feared God nor regarded man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And there was a widow in that city who kept coming to him and saying, Grant me justice against my adversary.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">For a while he refused; but afterward he said to himself, Though I neither fear God nor regard man,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">yet because this widow bothers me, I will give her justice, or she will wear me out by her continual coming.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And the Lord said, »Hear what the unjust judge says.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And will not God bring about justice for his elect, who cry to him day and night? Will he delay long over them?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">I tell you that he will bring about justice for them speedily. Nevertheless, when the Son of Man comes, will he find faith on the earth?«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Also he told this parable to some who trusted in themselves that they were righteous, and despised others:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">»Two men went up to the temple to pray, one a Pharisee and the other a tax collector.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">The Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself, God, I thank you that I am not like other menextortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even like this tax collector.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">I fast twice a week; I give tithes of all that I get.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">But the tax collector, standing far off, would not even lift up his eyes to heaven, but beat his breast, saying, God, be merciful to me a sinner!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">I tell you, this man went down to his house justified rather than the other; for everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, and he who humbles himself will be exalted.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Now they were also bringing infants to him that he might touch them; but when the disciples saw it, they rebuked them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">But Jesus called them to him and said, »Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them; for to such belongs the kingdom of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Truly, I say to you, whoever does not receive the kingdom of God like a little child will not enter it.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Now a certain ruler asked him, »Good Teacher, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">So Jesus said to him, »Why do you call me good? No one is good but God alone.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">You know the commandments: Do not commit adultery, Do not murder, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Honor your father and mother.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And he said, »All these I have kept from my youth.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">When Jesus heard it, he said to him, »One thing you still lack. Sell all that you have and distribute to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">But when he heard this, he became very sad, for he was extremely rich.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Jesus looked at him and said, »How hard it is for those who have riches to enter the kingdom of God!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">For it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Those who heard it said, »Then who can be saved?«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">But he said, »What is impossible with men is possible with God.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Then Peter said, »Behold, we have left all and followed you.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">So he said to them, »Truly, I say to you, there is no one who has left house or parents or brothers or wife or children, for the sake of the kingdom of God,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">who will not receive many times more in this time, and in the age to come eternal life.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Then he took the twelve aside and said to them, »Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem, and everything that is written of the Son of Man by the prophets will be accomplished.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="33">They will scourge him and kill him, and on the third day he will rise again.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">But they understood none of these things; this saying was hidden from them, and they did not know what he was talking about.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">As he drew near to Jericho, a blind man was sitting by the roadside begging.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">And hearing a multitude going by, he asked what this meant.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">They told him, »Jesus of Nazareth is passing by.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">And he cried out, »Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">And those who led the way rebuked him, telling him to be quiet; but he cried out all the more, »Son of David, have mercy on me!«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">So Jesus stopped, and commanded him to be brought to him. And when he came near, he asked him,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">»What do you want me to do for you?« He said, »Lord, I want to receive my sight.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">And Jesus said to him, »Receive your sight; your faith has made you well.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">And immediately he received his sight and followed him, glorifying God. And all the people, when they saw it, gave praise to God.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="19">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Jesus entered Jericho and was passing through.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Now behold, there was a man named Zacchaeus; he was a chief tax collector, and he was rich.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And he sought to see who Jesus was, but could not because of the crowd, for he was of short stature.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">So he ran on ahead and climbed up into a sycamore tree to see him, for he was to pass that way.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And when Jesus came to the place, he looked up and said to him, »Zacchaeus, make haste and come down; for I must stay at your house today.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">So he made haste and came down, and received him joyfully.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And when they saw it they all murmured, »He has gone in to be the guest of a man who is a sinner.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And Zacchaeus stood and said to the Lord, »Look, Lord, the half of my goods I give to the poor; and if I have defrauded any one of anything, I restore it fourfold.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And Jesus said to him, »Today salvation has come to this house, because he also is a son of Abraham.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">For the Son of Man came to seek and to save what was lost.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">As they heard these things, he went on to tell a parable, because he was near to Jerusalem, and because they thought that the kingdom of God was to appear immediately.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Therefore he said: »A certain nobleman went into a far country to receive for himself a kingdom and then return.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">So he called ten of his servants, gave them ten minas, and said to them, Do business till I come.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">But his citizens hated him and sent a delegation after him, saying, We do not want this man to reign over us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And so it was that when he returned, having received the kingdom, he then commanded these servants, to whom he had given the money, to be called to him, that he might know what they had gained by trading.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Then came the first, saying,  Master, your mina has earned ten minas more.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And he said to him, Well done, good servant! Because you have been faithful in a very little, be in authority over ten cities.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And the second came, saying, Master, your mina has earned five minas.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Likewise he said to him, You also be over five cities.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Then another came, saying, Master, here is your mina, which I have kept laid away in a handkerchief;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">for I was afraid of you, because you are a hard man. You take up what you did not lay down, and reap what you did not sow.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">He said to him, I will judge you out of your own mouth, you wicked servant! You knew that I was a hard man, taking up what I did not lay down and reaping what I did not sow?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Why then did you not put my money in the bank, that at my coming I might have collected it with interest?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And he said to those who stood by, Take the mina from him, and give it to him who has ten minas.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And they said to him, Master, he has ten minas already!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">I tell you, that to every one who has will more be given; but from him who has not, even what he has will be taken away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">But those enemies of mine, who did not want me to reign over them, bring them here and slay them before me.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">When he had said this, he went on ahead, going up to Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">When he came near to Bethphage and Bethany, at the mount that is called Olivet, he sent two of the disciples,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">saying, »Go into the village opposite you, where as you enter you will find a colt tied, on which no one has ever sat. Untie it and bring it here.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">If any one asks you, Why are you untying it? you shall say to him, The Lord has need of it.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">So those who were sent went away and found it just as he had told them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">And as they were untying the colt, its owners said to them, »Why are you untying the colt?«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">And they said, »The Lord has need of it.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">And they brought it to Jesus, and they threw their garments on the colt and set Jesus on it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">And as he went along, many spread their garments on the road.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">And, as he was now drawing near the descent of the Mount of Olives, the whole multitude of the disciples began to rejoice and praise God with a loud voice for all the mighty works they had seen,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">saying, <STYLE css="display:block;text-indent:5mm">»Blessed is the King</STYLE><STYLE css="display:block;text-indent:10mm">who comes in the name of the Lord!</STYLE><STYLE css="display:block;text-indent:5mm">Peace in heaven</STYLE><STYLE css="display:block;text-indent:10mm">and glory in the highest!«</STYLE></VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">And some of the Pharisees in the crowd said to him, »Teacher, rebuke your disciples.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">He answered, »I tell you, if these keep silent, the stones would cry out.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">And when he drew near and saw the city he wept over it,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">saying, »If you had known, even you, this day, the things that make for peace! But now they are hidden from your eyes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">For the days will come upon you when your enemies will build an embankment around you, and surround you and hem you in on every side,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">and dash you to the ground, you and your children within you, and they will not leave one stone upon another in you; because you did not know the time of your visitation.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">Then he entered the temple and began to drive out those who sold,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">saying to them, »It is written, <STYLE css="display:block;text-indent:5mm">My house shall be a house of prayer;</STYLE><STYLE css="display:block;text-indent:10mm">but you have made it a den of robbers.«</STYLE></VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">And he was teaching daily in the temple. But the chief priests the scribes and the leaders of the people sought to destroy him,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">but they could not find anything they could do, for all the people hung upon his words.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="20">
      <VERS vnumber="1">One day as he was teaching the people in the temple and preaching the gospel, the chief priests and the scribes, together with the elders, came up to him</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">and said to him, »Tell us by what authority are you doing these things? Or who it is that gave you this authority.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">He answered them, »I also will ask you a question; now tell me,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">the baptism of Johnwas it from heaven or from men?«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And they reasoned among themselves, saying, »If we say, From heaven, he will say, Why did you not believe him?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But if we say, From men, all the people will stone us, for they are persuaded that John was a prophet.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">So they answered that they did not know where it was from.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And Jesus said to them, »Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Then he began to tell the people this parable: »A man planted a vineyard, leased it to vine-dressers, and went into another country for a long time.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">At harvest time he sent a servant to the tenants, that they would give him some of the fruit of the vineyard. But the tenants beat him and sent him away empty-handed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">He sent another servant; him also they beat and treated shamefully, and sent him away empty-handed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">He sent a third; and they wounded him and cast him out.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Then the owner of the vineyard said, What shall I do? I will send my beloved son; perhaps they will respect him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">But when the tenants saw him, they reasoned among themselves and said, This is the heir. Let us kill him, that the inheritance may be ours.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">So they cast him out of the vineyard and killed him. What then will the owner of the vineyard do to them?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">He will come and destroy those tenants, and give the vineyard to others.« When they heard this, they said, »May this never be!«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">But he looked at them and said, »What then is this that is written: <STYLE css="display:block;text-indent:5mm">The stone which the builders rejected</STYLE><STYLE css="display:block;text-indent:10mm">has become the chief cornerstone?</STYLE></VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Everyone who falls on that stone will be broken to pieces; but on whomever it falls, it will grind him to powder.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">The chief priests and the scribes sought to lay hands on him that very hour, but they feared the peoplefor they knew that he had spoken this parable against them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">So they watched him, and sent spies who pretended to be righteous, that they might catch him on what he said, in order to deliver him up to the power and authority of the governor.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And they asked him, »Teacher, we know that you speak and teach rightly, and you do not show partiality, but teach the way of God in truth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Is it lawful for us to pay taxes to Caesar or not?«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">But he perceived their craftiness, and said to them,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">»Show me a denarius. Whose likeness and inscription does it have?« They said, »Caesars.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">He said to them, »Then render to Caesar the things that are Caesars, and to God the things that are Gods.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And they were not able in the presence of the people to catch him by what he said. But marveling at his answer they were silent.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Some of the Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection, came to him,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">and they questioned him, »Teacher, Moses wrote for us that if a mans brother dies, having a wife but no children, the man must take the wife and raise up children for his brother.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Now there were seven brothers. The first took a wife, and died without children.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And the second</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">and then the third took her, and in the same way the seven died, and they left no children.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">Finally the woman died also.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">In the resurrection, therefore, whose wife will she be? For all seven had her as wife.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">And Jesus said to them, »The sons of this age marry and are given in marriage.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">But those who are considered worthy to attain that age and the resurrection from the dead neither marry nor are given in marriage,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">nor can they die any more, for they are equal to the angels and are sons of God, being sons of the resurrection.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">But that the dead are raised, even Moses showed, in the passage about the bush, where he calls the Lord the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">Now he is not the God of the dead but of the living, for all live to him.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">And some of the scribes answered, »Teacher, you have spoken well.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">For they no longer dared to ask him any question.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">And he said to them, »How can they say that the Christ is the Son of David?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">For David himself says in the Book of Psalms, <STYLE css="display:block;text-indent:5mm">The Lord said to my Lord,</STYLE><STYLE css="display:block;text-indent:5mm">»Sit at my right hand,</STYLE></VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">
        <STYLE css="display:block;text-indent:10mm">till I make your enemies</STYLE>
        <STYLE css="display:block;text-indent:15mm">a footstool for your feet.«</STYLE>
      </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">David therefore calls him Lord, and how is he his son?«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">And in the hearing of all the people, he said to his disciples,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">»Beware of the scribes, who like to walk in long robes, and love greetings in the marketplaces and the best seats in the synagogues and the places of honor at feasts,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">who devour widows houses and for a pretense make long prayers. They will receive greater condemnation.«</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="21">
      <VERS vnumber="1">He looked up and saw the rich putting their gifts into the treasury,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">and he also saw a poor widow put in two copper coins.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">So he said, »Truly I tell you, this poor widow has put in more than all of the others;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">for these all contributed out of their abundance, but she out of her poverty put in all that she had to live on.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And as some spoke of the temple, how it was adorned with beautiful stones and offerings, he said,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">»As for these things which you see, the days will come when there shall not be left here one stone upon another that will not be thrown down.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">So they asked him, »Teacher, when will these things be? And what will be the sign when they are about to take place?«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And he said: »Take heed that you not are deceived. For many will come in my name, saying, I am he, and, The time is near. Do not go after them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And when you hear of wars and revolutions, do not be terrified; for these things must first take place, but the end will not come immediately.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Then he said to them, »Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">There will be great earthquakes, and in various places famines and pestilences; and there will be fearful sights and great signs from heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">But before all this, they will lay their hands on you and persecute you, delivering you up to the synagogues and prisons. And you will be brought before kings and governors for my name's sake.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">This will turn into an opportunity for you to bear testimony.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Therefore settle it in your minds not to meditate beforehand how you will answer;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">for I will give you a mouth and wisdom which none of your adversaries will be able to resist or contradict.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">You will be betrayed even by parents and brothers, relatives and friends; and they will put some of you to death.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">You will be hated by all for my name's sake.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">But not a hair of your head will perish.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">By your endurance you will gain your lives.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">»But when you see Jerusalem surrounded by armies, then know that its desolation is near.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Then let those in Judea flee to the mountains, let those who are in the city depart, and let not those who are out in the country enter it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">For these are days of vengeance, to fulfil all that is written.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Woe to those who are pregnant and to those who are nursing babies in those days! For there will be great distress in the land and wrath upon this people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">They will fall by the edge of the sword, and be led captive to all nations. Jerusalem will be trampled by the Gentiles until the times of the Gentiles are fulfilled.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">»There will be signs in sun and moon and stars, and on the earth distress of nations in perplexity at the roaring of the sea and the waves,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">men fainting from fear and foreboding of what is coming on the world, for the powers of the heavens will be shaken.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Then they will see the Son of Man coming in a cloud with power and great glory.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Now when these things begin to take place, look up and lift up your heads, because your redemption is drawing near.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">He told them a parable: »Look at the fig tree, and all the trees.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">When they are sprouting, you see and know for yourselves that summer is already near.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">So you also, when you see these things happening, know that the kingdom of God is near.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">Truly, I say to you, this generation will not pass away till all things take place.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will not pass away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">»But take heed to yourselves, lest your hearts be weighed down with dissipation and drunkenness and cares of this life, and that Day come on you unexpectedly like a trap.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="36">Watch at all times, and pray always that you may have strength to escape all these things that will take place, and to stand before the Son of Man.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">And every day he was teaching in the temple, but at night he went out to spend the night on the mount called Olivet.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">And early in the morning all the people came to him in the temple to hear him.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="22">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now the feast of Unleavened Bread drew near, which is called the Passover.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And the chief priests and the scribes were seeking how to kill him, for they feared the people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Then Satan entered Judas, called Iscariot, who was numbered of the twelve.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">So he went his way and conferred with the chief priests and officers, how he might betray him to them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And they were glad, and agreed to give him money.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">So he consented, and sought an opportunity to betray him to them in the absence of the multitude.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Then came the day of Unleavened Bread, on which the Passover lamb had to be sacrificed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">So he sent Peter and John, saying, »Go and prepare the Passover for us, that we may eat.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">They said to him, »Where do you want us to prepare it?«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">He said to them, »Behold, when you have entered the city, a man carrying a jar of water will meet you; follow him into the house which he enters.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And say to the owner of the house, The Teacher says to you: Where is the guest room, where I may eat the Passover with my disciples?</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="13">So they went, and found it just as he had told them; and they prepared the Passover.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">When the hour came, he sat at table, and the apostles with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And he said to them, »I have earnestly desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">for I tell you, I will not eat it again until it is fulfilled in the kingdom of God.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Then he took the cup, and gave thanks, and said, »Take this and divide it among yourselves;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">for I tell you, I will not drink of the fruit of the vine until the kingdom of God comes.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And he took bread, gave thanks and broke it, and gave it to them, saying, »This is my body which is given for you; do this in remembrance of me.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Likewise he took the cup after supper, saying, »This cup is the new covenant in my blood, which is poured out for you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">But behold the hand of him who betrays me is with me on the table.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">For the Son of Man goes as it has been determined, but woe to that man by whom he is betrayed!«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Then they began to question among themselves, which of them it was who would do this.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">A dispute also arose among them, which of them was to be considered the greatest.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And he said to them, »The kings of the Gentiles exercise lordship over them; and those who exercise authority over them are called benefactors.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">But not so among you; on the contrary, he who is greatest among you, let him be as the youngest, and he who leads as one who serves.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">For who is greater, one who sits at the table, or one who serves? Is it not the one who sits at the table? But I am among you as One who serves.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">You are those who have continued with me in my trials.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="33">But he said to him, »Lord, I am ready to go with you to prison and to death.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">He said, »I tell you, Peter, the rooster will not crow this day before you deny three times that you know me.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">And he said to them, »When I sent you out with no purse or bag or sandals, did you lack anything?« They said, »Nothing.«</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="38">They said, »Look, Lord, here are two swords.« And he said to them, »It is enough.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">He came out, and went to the Mount of Olives, as was his custom, and his disciples followed him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">When he came to the place, he said to them, »Pray that you may not enter into temptation.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">And he withdrew from them about a stones throw, and knelt down and prayed,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">»Father, if you are willing, take this cup from me; nevertheless not my will, but yours, be done.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">An angel appeared to him from heaven, and strengthened him.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="45">When he rose from prayer, and came to his disciples, he found them sleeping from sorrow.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">He said to them, »Why do you sleep? Rise and pray that you may not enter into temptation.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">While he was still speaking, a crowd came, and the man who was called Judas, one of the twelve, was leading them. He drew near to Jesus to kiss him;</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="49">When those around him saw what was going to happen, they said, »Lord, shall we strike with the sword?«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">And one of them struck the servant of the high priest and cut off his right ear.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="51">But Jesus answered, »No more of this!« And he touched his ear and healed him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="52">Then Jesus said to the chief priests, officers of the temple, and the elders who had come to him, »Have you come out as against a robber, with swords and clubs?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="53">When I was with you day after day in the temple, you did not lay hands on me. But this is your hour, and the power of darkness.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="54">Then they seized him and led him away, bringing him into the high priests house. Peter followed at a distance.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="55">When they had kindled a fire in the middle of the courtyard and sat down together, Peter sat among them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="56">And a servant girl, seeing him as he sat in the firelight, looked at him, and said, »This man also was with him.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="57">But he denied it, saying, »Woman, I do not know him.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="58">And a little later some one else saw him and said, »You also are of them.« But Peter said, »Man, I am not!«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="59">Then after about an hour had passed, another insisted, saying, »Certainly this fellow also was with him, for he is a Galilean.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="60">But Peter said, »Man, I do not know what you are saying!« Immediately, while he was still speaking, the rooster crowed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="61">And the Lord turned and looked at Peter. And Peter remembered the word of the Lord, how he had said to him, »Before the rooster crows today, you will deny me three times.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="62">And he went out and wept bitterly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="63">Now the men who were holding Jesus mocked him and beat him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="64">They blindfolded him and asked him, »Prophesy! Who is the one who struck you?«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="65">And they spoke many other things against him, blaspheming.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="66">As soon as it was day, the council of the elders of the people came together, both chief priests and scribes; and they led him away to their council chamber, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="67">»If you are the Christ, tell us.« But he said to them, »If I tell you, you will not believe.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="68">And if I ask you, you will not answer.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="69">But from now on the Son of Man will be seated at the right hand of the power of God.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="70">They all said, »Are you the Son of God, then?« He said to them, »You said what I am.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="71">And they said, »What further testimony do we need? We have heard it ourselves from his own lips.«</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="23">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Then the whole body of them arose and led him to Pilate.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And they began to accuse him, saying, »We found this man perverting our nation and forbidding to pay taxes to Caesar, saying that he himself is Christ, a king.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">So Pilate asked him, »Are you the King of the Jews?« He answered him, »It is as you say.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Then Pilate said to the chief priests and the crowd, »I find no crime in this man.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">But they were urgent, saying, »He stirs up the people, teaching throughout all Judea, from Galilee to this place.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">When Pilate heard this, he asked if the man was a Galilean.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And when he learned that he belonged to Herods jurisdiction, he sent him to Herod, who also was in Jerusalem at that time.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Now when Herod saw Jesus, he was very glad, for he had desired to see him for a long time, because he had heard about him, and he hoped to see some miracle done by him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Then he questioned him with many words, but he gave him no answer.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">The chief priests and the scribes stood by, vehemently accusing him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And Herod with his soldiers treated him with contempt and mocked him; then, dressing him in a gorgeous robe, he sent him back to Pilate.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">That very day Pilate and Herod became friends with each other, for before this they had been at enmity with each other.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Pilate then called together the chief priests, the rulers, and the people,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">and said to them, »You have brought this man to me as one who was inciting the people to rebellion. And behold, having examined him in your presence, I have found no guilt in this man concerning those charges which you make against him;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">neither did Herod, for he sent him back to us. Behold, nothing deserving death has been done by him;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">I will therefore chastise him and release him.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">
      </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">But they all cried out together, »Away with this man, and release to us Barabbas«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">a man who had been thrown into prison for an insurrection in the city, and for murder.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Wanting to release Jesus, Pilate addressed to them again.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">But they shouted, »Crucify him, crucify him!«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Then he said to them the third time, »Why, what evil has he done? I have found in him no crime deserving death. I will therefore chastise him and release him.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">But they were insistent, demanding with loud voices that he be crucified. And their voices prevailed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">So Pilate gave sentence that their demand should be granted.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And he released the man who had been thrown into prison for insurrection and murder, the one they asked for; but Jesus he delivered up to their will.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And as they led him away, they seized one Simon of Cyrene, who was coming in from the country, and laid on him the cross, to carry it behind Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And a great multitude of the people followed him, and women who also mourned and lamented him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">But Jesus turning to them said, »Daughters of Jerusalem, do not weep for me, but weep for yourselves and for your children.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">For behold, the days are coming when they will say, Blessed are the barren, the wombs that never bore, and the breasts that never nursed!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">
        <STYLE css="display:block;text-indent:5mm">Then they will begin to say to the mountains,</STYLE>

      <VERS vnumber="31">For if they do these things when the wood is green, what will happen when it is dry?«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">Two others, criminals, were also led with him to be put to death.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">And when they came to the place called The Skull, there they crucified him, and the criminals, one on the right and the other on the left.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Then Jesus said, »Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do.« And they divided his garments and cast lots.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">And the people stood watching; but even the rulers sneered at him, saying, »He saved others; let him save himself if he is the Christ of God, the Chosen One.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">The soldiers also mocked him, coming up and offering him wine vinegar,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">and saying, »If you are the King of the Jews, save yourself.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">There was also an inscription written over him: <STYLE css="display:block;text-indent:5mm">THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS.</STYLE></VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">One of the criminals who were hanged there hurled insults at him, saying, »Are you not the Christ? Save yourself and us!«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">But the other rebuked him, saying, »Do you not fear God, since you are under the same sentence of condemnation?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">And we indeed justly, for we are receiving the due reward of our deeds; but this man has done nothing wrong.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">Then he said, »Jesus, remember me when you come into your kingdom.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">And Jesus said to him, »Truly, I say to you, today you will be with me in Paradise.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">It was now about the sixth hour, and there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">for the sun was darkened; and the curtain of the temple was torn in two.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">And Jesus, crying out with a loud voice, said, »Father, into your hands I commit my spirit.« And having said this, he breathed his last.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">Now when the centurion saw what had happened, he praised God, and said, »Certainly this was a righteous man!«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">When all the multitudes who had gathered to witness this sight saw what had taken place, they beat their breasts, and returned home.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">But all his acquaintances, and the women who had followed him from Galilee, stood at a distance, watching these things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">Now there was a man named Joseph, a member of the Council, a good and righteous man,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="51">who had not consented to their decision and deed. He came from of Arimathea, a city of the Jews, and he was waiting for the kingdom of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="52">This man went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="53">Then he took it down and wrapped it in linen cloth, and laid it in a tomb that was hewn out of the rock, where no one had ever yet been laid.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="54">It was the Preparation Day, and the Sabbath was about to begin.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="55">The women who had come with him from Galilee followed and saw the tomb, and how his body was laid.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="56">Then they returned and prepared spices and perfumes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="57">
        <STYLE css="display:block;text-indent:5mm">And on the Sabbath they rested according to the commandment.</STYLE>
      </VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="24">
      <VERS vnumber="1">But on the first day of the week, at early dawn, they came to the tomb, bringing the spices which they had prepared.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And they found the stone rolled away from the tomb,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">but when they went in they did not find the body of the Lord Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">While they were perplexed about this, behold, two men stood by them in dazzling apparel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And as they were terrified and bowed their faces to the ground, the men said to them, »Why do you seek the living among the dead?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">He is not here, but is risen! Remember how he told you while he was still in Galilee,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">The Son of Man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and on the third day rise again.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And they remembered his words.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Then they returned from the tomb and told all these things to the eleven and to all the rest.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">It was Mary Magdalene, Joanna, Mary the mother of James, and the other women with them, who told this to the apostles.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">But their words seemed to them like idle tales, and they did not believe them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">But Peter arose and ran to the tomb; and stooping down, he saw the linen wrappings lying by themselves; and he went away, marveling to himself at what had happened.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Now behold, that same day two of them were going to a village called Emmaus, about seven miles from Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And they were talking with each other about all these things that had happened.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">While they talked and discussed, Jesus himself drew near and went with them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">But their eyes were kept from recognizing him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And he said to them, »What is this conversation which you are exchanging with each other as you walk?« And they stood still, looking sad.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Then one of them, named Cleopas, answered him, »Are you the only visitor to Jerusalem and do not know the things that have happened there in these days?«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And he said to them, »What things?« And they said to him, »The things concerning Jesus of Nazareth, who was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">and how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him to be condemned to death, and crucified him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">But we had hoped that he was the one who was going to redeem Israel. Indeed, besides all this, it is the third day since all this happened.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">In addition, some women of our company amazed us. They were at the tomb early in the morning,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">and when they did not find his body, they came saying that they had also seen a vision of angels who said he was alive.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Some of those who were with us went to the tomb, and found it just as the women had said; but him they did not see.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And he said to them, »O foolish men, and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Did not the Christ have to suffer these things and enter his glory?«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And beginning with Moses and all the prophets, he explained to them the things concerning himself in all the scriptures.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">As they drew near the village to which they were going, he acted as though he would be going farther,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">but they constrained him, saying, »Stay with us, for it is toward evening and the day is now far spent.« So he went in to stay with them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">When he was at the table with them, he took bread, blessed and broke it, and gave it to them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Then their eyes were opened and they recognized him; and he vanished from their sight.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">And they said to each other, »Did not our hearts burn within us while he talked with us on the road, while he opened to us the scriptures?«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">So they rose up that very hour and returned to Jerusalem, and they found the eleven and those who were with them gathered together,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">saying, »The Lord has risen indeed, and has appeared to Simon!«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">Then they told what had happened on the road, and how he was known to them in the breaking of the bread.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">As they were saying this, Jesus himself stood among them and said to them, »Peace be with you.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">But they were startled and frightened, and supposed that they saw a spirit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">And he said to them, »Why are you troubled, and why do doubts rise in your hearts?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">See my hands and my feet, that it is I myself. Handle me and see, for a spirit does not have flesh and bones as you see I have.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">When he had said this, he showed them his hands and his feet.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">And while they still did not believe for joy, and marveled, he said to them, »Have you anything here to eat?«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">They gave him a piece of broiled fish,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">and he took it and ate in their presence.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">Then he said to them, »These are my words which I spoke to you, while I was still with you, that everything written about me in the law of Moses and the prophets and the psalms must be fulfilled.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">Then he opened their minds, so they could understand the Scriptures.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">And he said to them, »Thus it is written, that the Christ should suffer and rise again from the dead the third day,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">and that repentance and forgiveness of sins should be preached in his name to all nations, beginning at Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">You are witnesses of these things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">And behold, I send the promise of my Father upon you; but stay in the city, until you are clothed with power from on high.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">Then he led them out as far as Bethany, and he lifted up his hands and blessed them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="51">While he blessed them, he parted from them, and was carried up into heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="52">Then they worshiped him and returned to Jerusalem with great joy,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="53">and were continually in the temple praising God.</VERS>

  <BIBLEBOOK bnumber="43">
    <CHAPTER cnumber="1">
      <VERS vnumber="1">In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">He was with God in the beginning.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">All things were made through him, and without him nothing was made that was made.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">In him was life, and the life was the light of men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness did not comprehend it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">There was a man sent from God, whose name was John.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">He came for a witness, to bear witness of the light, that all might believe through him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">He was not the light, but came to bear witness of the light.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">The true light that gives light to every man was coming into the world.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">He was in the world, and the world was made through him, and the world did not know him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">He came to his own, and his own did not receive him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">But to all who received him, to those who believed in his name, he gave the right to become children of God</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">who were born, not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man, but of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we have seen his glory, the glory as of the only begotten from the Father, full of grace and truth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">John bore witness of him and cried out, saying, »This was he of whom I said, He who comes after me ranks before me, for he was before me.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And from his fullness have we all received, grace upon grace.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">For the law was given through Moses; grace and truth came through Jesus Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">No one has ever seen God; God the only Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, he has made him known.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Now this is the testimony of John, when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, »Who are you?«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">He confessed, he did not deny, but confessed, »I am not the Christ.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And they asked him, »What then? Are you Elijah?« He said, »I am not.« »Are you the prophet?« And he answered, »No.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Then they said to him, »Who are you? Give us an answer for those who sent us. What do you say about yourself?«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">He said, <STYLE css="display:block;text-indent:5mm">»I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness,</STYLE><STYLE css="display:block;text-indent:5mm">Make straight the way of the Lord,</STYLE> as the prophet Isaiah said.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Now they had been sent from the Pharisees.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">They asked him, »Then why do you baptize, if you are not the Christ, nor Elijah, nor the prophet?«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">John answered them, »I baptize with water, but there stands One among you whom you do not know.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">It is he who comes after me, the thong of whose sandal I am not worthy to untie.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">This took place in Bethany beyond the Jordan, where John was baptizing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">The next day John saw Jesus coming toward him, and said, »Behold, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">This is he of whom I said, After me comes a man who ranks before me, for he was before me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">I myself did not know him; but for this I came baptizing with water, that he might be revealed to Israel.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">And John bore witness, »I saw the Spirit descend as a dove from heaven, and it remained on him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">I did not know him, but he who sent me to baptize with water said to me, He on whom you see the Spirit descend and remain, this is he who baptizes with the Holy Spirit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">And I have seen and testified that this is the Son of God.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">Again the next day John was standing with two of his disciples.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">And he looked at Jesus as he walked, and said, »Behold, the Lamb of God!«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">The two disciples heard him say this, and they followed Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">Jesus turned, and saw them following, and said to them, »What do you seek?« They said to him, »Rabbi« (which means Teacher), »where are you staying?«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">He said to them, »Come and see.« They came and saw where he was staying; and they stayed with him that day, for it was about the tenth hour.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">One of the two who heard John speak, and followed him, was Andrew, Simon Peter's brother.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">He first found his own brother Simon, and said to him, »We have found the Messiah« (which means the Christ).</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">He brought him to Jesus. Jesus looked at him and said, »You are Simon son of John. You shall be called Cephas« (which means Peter).</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">The next day Jesus wanted to go to Galilee. And he found Philip and said to him, »Follow me.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">Now Philip was from Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">Philip found Nathanael and said to him, »We have found him of whom Moses in the law, and also the prophets, wrote  Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">And Nathanael said to him, »Can anything good come out of Nazareth?« Philip said to him, »Come and see.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">Jesus saw Nathanael coming toward him, and said of him, »Behold, an Israelite indeed, in whom is no deceit!«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">Nathanael said to him, »How do you know me?« Jesus answered him, »Before Philip called you, when you were under the fig tree, I saw you.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">Nathanael answered him, »Rabbi, you are the Son of God! You are the King of Israel!«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">Jesus answered him, »Because I said to you, I saw you under the fig tree, do you believe? You shall see greater things than these.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="51">And he said to him, »Truly, truly, I say to you, you shall see heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of Man.«</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="2">
      <VERS vnumber="1">On the third day there was a wedding at Cana in Galilee, and the mother of Jesus was there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And Jesus and his disciples had also been invited to the wedding.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">When the wine was gone, the mother of Jesus said to him, »They have no wine.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Jesus said to her, »Woman, what have you to do with me? My hour has not yet come.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">His mother said to the servants, »Do whatever he tells you.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Now six stone jars were standing there, according to the manner for purification of the Jews, each holding twenty or thirty gallons.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Jesus said to them, »Fill the jars with water.« And they filled them up to the brim.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">He said to them, »Now draw some out, and take it to the master of the feast.« So they took it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">When the master of the feast had tasted the water that was made wine, and did not know where it had come from (though the servants who had drawn the water knew), the master of the feast called the bridegroom.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And he said to him, »Every man sets out the good wine first; and when the guests have drunk freely, then the poor wine; but you have kept the good wine until now.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">This, the first of his signs, Jesus did at Cana in Galilee, and manifested his glory; and his disciples believed in him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">After this he went down to Capernaum, with his mother and his brothers and his disciples; and there they stayed for a few days.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">The Passover of the Jews was at hand, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">In the temple he found those who were selling oxen and sheep and doves, and the money-changers at their business.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And he made a whip of cords, and drove them all, with the sheep and oxen, out of the temple; and he poured out the coins of the money-changers and overturned their tables.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And he said to those who sold doves, »Take these things away! You shall not make my Father's house a house of merchandise!«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">His disciples remembered that it was written, »Zeal for your house will consume me.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Then the Jews said to him, »What sign do you show to us, since you do this?«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Jesus answered them, »Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">The Jews then said, »It has taken forty-six years to build this temple, and will you raise it up in three days?«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">But he was speaking of the temple of his body.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">When therefore he was raised from the dead, his disciples remembered that he had said this; and they believed the scripture and the word which Jesus had spoken.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Now when he was in Jerusalem at the Passover feast, many believed in his name when they saw the signs which he did.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">But Jesus did not trust himself to them, because he knew all men,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">and he had no need for anyone to bear witness of man, for he knew what was in man.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="3">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now there was a man of the Pharisees, named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">This man came to Jesus by night and said to him, »Rabbi, we know that you are a teacher come from God; for no one can do these signs that you do unless God is with him.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Jesus answered him, »Truly, truly, I say to you, unless one is born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Nicodemus said to him, »How can a man be born when he is old? Can he enter a second time into his mother's womb and be born?«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Jesus answered, »Truly, truly, I say to you, unless one is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Do not marvel that I said to you, You must be born again.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">The wind blows where it wishes, and you hear the sound of it, but you cannot tell where it comes from or where it goes. So it is with everyone who is born of the Spirit.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Nicodemus said to him, »How can this be?«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Jesus answered him, »Are you the teacher of Israel, and yet you do not understand these things?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Truly, truly, I say to you, we speak of what we know, and testify to what we have seen; but you do not receive our testimony.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">If I have told you earthly things and you do not believe, how will you believe if I tell you heavenly things?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">No one has ascended into heaven, but he who came from heaven  the Son of Man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so must the Son of Man be lifted up,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">that whoever believes in him may have eternal life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">For God so loved the world that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world through him might be saved.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">He who believes in him is not condemned; but he who does not believe is condemned already, because he has not believed in the name of the only Son of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And this is the judgment, that the light has come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">For every one who does evil hates the light, and does not come to the light, lest his deeds should be exposed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">But he who does the truth comes to the light, that it may be clearly seen that his deeds have been done in God.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">After this Jesus and his disciples went into the land of Judea, and there he remained with them and baptized.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Now John also was baptizing at Aenon near Salim, because there was much water there; and people came and were baptized.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">For John had not yet been put in prison.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Now a discussion arose between some of John's disciples and a Jew over purifying.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And they came to John and said to him, »Rabbi, he who was with you beyond the Jordan, to whom you have testifiedbehold, he is baptizing, and all are going to him.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">John answered, »A man can receive only what is given to him from heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">You yourselves bear me witness, that I said, I am not the Christ, but I have been sent before him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">He who has the bride is the bridegroom; but the friend of the bridegroom, who stands and hears him, rejoices greatly because of the bridegroom's voice. Therefore this joy of mine is now full.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="31">»He who comes from above is above all; he who is of the earth belongs to the earth, and of the earth he speaks. He who comes from heaven is above all.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">He testifies to what he has seen and heard; yet no one receives his testimony.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">He who has received his testimony has certified that God is true.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">For he whom God has sent speaks the words of God, for God gives the Spirit without measure.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">The Father loves the Son, and has given all things into his hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">He who believes in the Son has eternal life; he who does not obey the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God remains on him.«</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="4">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now when the Lord knew that the Pharisees had heard that Jesus was making and baptizing more disciples than John</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">(although Jesus himself did not baptize, but only his disciples),</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">he left Judea and departed again to Galilee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Now he had to go through Samaria.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">So he came to a city of Samaria which is called Sychar, near the plot of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Jacob's well was there, and Jesus, wearied as he was from his journey, sat down by the well. It was about the sixth hour.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">There came a woman of Samaria to draw water. Jesus said to her, »Give me a drink.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">For his disciples had gone away into the city to buy food.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Then the woman of Samaria said to him, »How is it that you, being a Jew, ask a drink from me, a Samaritan woman?« For Jews have no dealings with Samaritans.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Jesus answered her, »If you knew the gift of God, and who it is that is saying to you, Give me a drink, you would have asked him, and he would have given you living water.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">The woman said to him, »Sir, you have nothing to draw with, and the well is deep. Where do you get that living water?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Are you greater than our father Jacob, who gave us the well, and drank from it himself, as well as his sons and his cattle?«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Jesus answered her, »Everyone who drinks of this water will thirst again,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">but whoever drinks of the water that I shall give him will never thirst. The water that I shall give him will become in him a spring of water welling up to eternal life.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">The woman said to him, »Sir, give me this water, that I may not thirst, nor come here to draw.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Jesus said to her, »Go, call your husband, and come here.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">The woman answered, »I have no husband.« Jesus said to her, »You are right in saying, I have no husband;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">for you have had five husbands, and the one whom you now have is not your husband; this you have said truly.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">The woman said to him, »Sir, I perceive that you are a prophet.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Our fathers worshiped on this mountain, and you Jews say that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Jesus said to her, »Woman, believe me, the hour is coming when neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem will you worship the Father.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">You worship what you do not know; we worship what we know, for salvation is from the Jews.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">But the hour is coming, and now is, when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth, for such the Father seeks to worship him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">God is spirit, and those who worship him must worship in spirit and truth.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">The woman said to him, »I know that Messiah is coming« (who is called Christ). »When he comes, he will tell us all things.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Jesus said to her, »I who speak to you am he.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Just then his disciples came. And they marveled that he was talking with a woman, but no one said, »What do you wish?« or, »Why are you talking with her?«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Then the woman left her water jar, and went away into the city, and said to the people,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">»Come, see a man who told me all that I ever did. Could this be the Christ?«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">They went out of the city and came to him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Meanwhile his disciples urged him, saying, »Rabbi, eat.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">But he said to them, »I have food to eat of which you do not know.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">So the disciples said to one another, »Has any one brought him food?«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Jesus said to them, »My food is to do the will of him who sent me, and to finish his work.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">Do you not say, There are yet four months and then comes the harvest? Behold, I tell you, lift up your eyes, and look at the fields! They are already white for harvest.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">And he who reaps receives wages, and gathers fruit for eternal life, so that sower and reaper may rejoice together.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">For here the saying is true, One sows and another reaps.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">I sent you to reap that for which you have not labored; others have labored, and you have entered into their labor.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">Many of the Samaritans from that city believed in him because of the woman's testimony, »He told me all that I ever did.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">So when the Samaritans came to him, they urged him to stay with them; and he stayed there two days.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">And many more believed because of his word.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">They said to the woman, »We no longer believe just because of what you said; now we have heard for ourselves, and we know that this man is indeed the Savior of the world.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">After the two days he departed to Galilee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">For Jesus himself testified that a prophet has no honor in his own country.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">So when he came to Galilee, the Galileans welcomed him, having seen all that he had done in Jerusalem at the feast, for they too had gone to the feast.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">So he came again to Cana in Galilee, where he had made the water wine. And at Capernaum there was an official whose son was sick.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">When he heard that Jesus had come from Judea to Galilee, he went to him and begged him to come down and heal his son, for he was at the point of death.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">Jesus said to him, »Unless you people see signs and wonders, you will never believe.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">The official said to him, »Sir, come down before my child dies.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">Jesus said to him, »Go; your son will live.« The man believed the word that Jesus spoke to him and went his way.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="51">As he was going down, his servants met him and told him that his son was living.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="52">So he inquired of them the hour when his son got better, and they said to him, »Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="53">So the father knew that it was at the same hour in which Jesus had said to him, »Your son will live.« And he himself believed, and all his household.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="54">This was now the second sign that Jesus did when he had come from Judea to Galilee.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="5">
      <VERS vnumber="1">After this there was a feast of the Jews, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Now there is in Jerusalem by the Sheep Gate a pool, which is called in Hebrew, Bethesda, having five porches.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">In these lay a multitude of disabled people, blind, lame, paralyzed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">
      </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">One man who was there had been an invalid for thirty-eight years.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">When Jesus saw him lying there and knew that he had been in this condition for a long time, he said to him, »Do you want to be made well?«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">The sick man answered him, »Sir, I have no man to put me into the pool when the water is stirred up; but while I am coming, another steps down before me.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Jesus said to him, »Rise, take up your bed, and walk.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And at once the man was healed, and he took up his bed and walked. <STYLE css="display:block;text-indent:5mm">Now that day was the Sabbath.</STYLE></VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">So the Jews said to the man who was cured, »It is the Sabbath; it is not lawful for you to carry your bed.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">But he answered them, »The man who made me well said to me, Take up your bed, and walk.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">They asked him, »Who is the man who said to you, Take up your bed, and walk?«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Now the man who had been healed did not know who it was, for Jesus had withdrawn, as there was a crowd in that place.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Afterward, Jesus found him in the temple, and said to him, »See, you are well. Sin no more, so that nothing worse may happen to you.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">The man went away and told the Jews that it was Jesus who had made him well.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">For this reason the Jews persecuted Jesus, because he was doing these things on the Sabbath.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">But Jesus answered them, »My Father is working still, and I am working.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Therefore the Jews sought all the more to kill him, because he not only broke the Sabbath, but also said that God was his Father, making himself equal with God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Jesus said to them, »Truly, truly, I say to you, the Son can do nothing of himself, but only what he sees the Father doing; for whatever he does, the Son also does.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">For the Father loves the Son, and shows him all things that he himself does; and he will show him greater works than these, that you may marvel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">For as the Father raises the dead and gives life to them, even so the Son gives life to whom he will.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">For the Father judges no one, but has given all judgment to the Son,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">that all may honor the Son just as they honor the Father. He who does not honor the Son does not honor the Father who sent him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Truly, truly, I say to you, he who hears my word and believes him who sent me, has eternal life; and shall not come into judgment, but has passed from death to life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Truly, truly, I say to you, the hour is coming, and now is, when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God; and those who hear will live.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">For as the Father has life in himself, so he has granted the Son also to have life in himself,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">and has given him authority to execute judgment, because he is the Son of Man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Do not marvel at this; for the hour is coming when all who are in the graves will hear his voice</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">and come forth  those who have done good, to the resurrection of life, and those who have done evil, to the resurrection of judgment.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">»I can do nothing of myself; as I hear, I judge; and my judgment is just, because I seek not my own will but the will of him who sent me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">»If I bear witness of myself, my testimony is not true.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">There is another who bears witness of me, and I know that the testimony which he bears of me is true.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">You have sent to John, and he has borne witness to the truth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Not that the testimony which I receive is from man; but I say this that you may be saved.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">He was a burning and shining lamp, and you were willing to rejoice for a time in his light.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">But the testimony which I have is greater than that of John; for the works which the Father has given me to finish, these very works which I am doing, bear witness of me, that the Father has sent me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">And the Father who sent me has himself testified of me. You have never heard his voice, nor seen his form.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">And you do not have his word abiding in you, for you do not believe him whom he has sent.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">You search the Scriptures, because in them you think that you have eternal life; and these are they that testify of me.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="6">
      <VERS vnumber="1">After this Jesus went to the other side of the Sea of Galilee, which is the Sea of Tiberias.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And a great multitude followed him, because they saw his signs which he performed on those who were diseased.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Jesus went up on the mountain, and there sat down with his disciples.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Now the Passover, the feast of the Jews, was near.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Then Jesus lifted up his eyes, and seeing a great multitude coming toward him, he said to Philip, »Where shall we buy bread, that these people may eat?«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But this he said to test him, for he himself knew what he would do.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Philip answered him, »Two hundred denarii would not buy enough bread for each one of them to have a little.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">One of his disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, said to him,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">»There is a lad here who has five barley loaves and two small fish, but what are they among so many?«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Jesus said, »Make the people sit down.« Now there was much grass in the place; so the men sat down, in number about five thousand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Jesus then took the loaves, and when he had given thanks, he distributed them to those who were seated; so also the fish, as much as they wanted.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And when they had eaten their fill, he said to his disciples, »Gather up the fragments left over, that nothing may be lost.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">So they gathered them up and filled twelve baskets with the fragments of the five barley loaves, left over by those who had eaten.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">When the people saw the sign that Jesus did, they said, »Surely this is the Prophet who is to come into the world.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Perceiving then that they were about to come and take him by force to make him king, Jesus withdrew again to the mountain by himself.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">When evening came, his disciples went down to the sea,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">got into a boat, and started across the sea to Capernaum. It was now dark, and Jesus had not yet come to them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">The sea rose because a strong wind was blowing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">So when they had rowed about three or four miles, they saw Jesus walking on the sea and drawing near the boat; and they were afraid.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">But he said to them, »It is I; do not be afraid.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Then they were glad to take him into the boat, and immediately the boat was at the land where they were going.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">On the next day the people who remained on the other side of the sea saw that there had been only one boat there, and that Jesus had not entered the boat with his disciples, but that his disciples had gone away alone.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">However, boats from Tiberias came near the place where they ate the bread after the Lord had given thanks.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">So when the people saw that Jesus was not there, nor his disciples, they also got into the boats and went to Capernaum, seeking Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">When they found him on the other side of the sea, they said to him, »Rabbi, when did you come here?«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Jesus answered them, »Truly, truly, I say to you, you seek me, not because you saw the signs, but because you ate your fill of the loaves.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Do not labor for the food which perishes, but for the food which endures to eternal life, which the Son of Man will give to you; for on him has God the Father set his seal.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Then they said to him, »What must we do, to be doing the works of God?«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Jesus answered them, »This is the work of God, that you believe in him whom he has sent.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">So they said to him, »What sign will you perform then, that we may see it and believe you? What work will you do?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Our fathers ate the manna in the desert; as it is written, He gave them bread from heaven to eat.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">Jesus then said to them, »Truly, truly, I say to you, it was not Moses who gave you the bread from heaven; but my Father gives you the true bread from heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">For the bread of God is he who comes down from heaven and gives life to the world.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Then they said to him, »Lord, give us this bread always.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">And Jesus said to them, »I am the bread of life. He who comes to me shall never hunger, and he who believes in me shall never thirst.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">But I said to you that you have seen me and yet do not believe.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">All that the Father gives me will come to me, and the one who comes to me I will by no means cast out.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">For I have come down from heaven, not to do my own will, but the will of him who sent me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">And this is the will of him who sent me, that I should lose nothing of all that he has given me, but raise it up at the last day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">For this is the will of my Father, that every one who sees the Son and believes in him should have eternal life; and I will raise him up at the last day.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">The Jews then began to murmur about him, because he said, »I am the bread which came down from heaven.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">They said, »Is not this Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? How does he now say, I have come down from heaven?«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">Jesus answered them, »Do not murmur among yourselves.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him; and I will raise him up at the last day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">It is written in the prophets, And they shall all be taught by God. Everyone who has heard and learned from the Father comes to me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">Not that any one has seen the Father except the one who is from God; he has seen the Father.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">Truly, truly, I say to you, he who believes has everlasting life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">I am the bread of life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">Your fathers ate the manna in the wilderness, and they died.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">This is the bread which comes down from heaven, that a man may eat of it and not die.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="51">I am the living bread which came down from heaven. If anyone eats of this bread, he will live for ever; and the bread which I shall give for the life of the world is my flesh.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="52">Then the Jews began to argue among themselves, saying, »How can this man give us his flesh to eat?«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="53">So Jesus said to them, »Truly, truly, I say to you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood, you have no life in you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="54">Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life, and I will raise him up at the last day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="55">For my flesh is food indeed, and my blood is drink indeed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="56">He who eats my flesh and drinks my blood abides in me, and I in him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="57">As the living Father sent me, and I live because of the Father, so he who feeds on me will live because of me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="58">This is the bread which came down from heaven, not as your fathers ate the manna and died. He who eats this bread will live for ever.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="59">This he said in the synagogue as he taught in Capernaum.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="60">Many of his disciples, when they heard it, said, »This is a hard saying; who can listen to it?«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="61">When Jesus knew in himself that his disciples complained about this, he said to them, »Does this offend you?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="62">What then if you should see the Son of Man ascend to where he was before?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="63">It is the Spirit who gives life; the flesh profits nothing. The words that I have spoken to you are spirit, and they are life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="64">But there are some of you who do not believe.« For Jesus knew from the beginning who they were who did not believe, and who would betray him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="65">And he said, »This is why I told you that no one can come to me unless it has been granted to him by the Father.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="66">From this time many of his disciples went back and no longer walked with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="67">Then Jesus said to the twelve, »Do you also want to go away?«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="68">Simon Peter answered him, »Lord, to whom shall we go? You have the words of eternal life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="69">And we believe, and have come to know, that you are the Holy One of God.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="70">Jesus answered them, »Did I not choose you, the twelve, and one of you is a devil?«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="71">He spoke of Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon, for it was he who was to betray him, though one of the twelve.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="7">
      <VERS vnumber="1">After this Jesus went about in Galilee; he would not go about in Judea, because the Jews sought to kill him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Now the Jews' feast of Tabernacles was at hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">So his brothers said to him, »Leave here and go to Judea, that your disciples may see the works you are doing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">For no one works in secret if he seeks to be known openly. If you do these things, show yourself to the world.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">For even his brothers did not believe in him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Jesus said to them, »My time has not yet come, but your time is always ready.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">The world cannot hate you, but it hates me because I testify of it that its works are evil.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">You go up to the feast. I am not yet going up to this feast, for my time has not yet fully come.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Having said this, he remained in Galilee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">But after his brothers had gone up to the feast, then he also went up, not publicly, but in secret.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">The Jews were looking for him at the feast, and saying, »Where is he?«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And there was much complaining among the people about him. Some said, »He is a good man«; others said, »No, on the contrary, he deceives the people.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">However, no one spoke openly of him for fear of the Jews.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Now about the middle of the feast Jesus went up into the temple and taught.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And the Jews marveled, saying, »How did this man get such learning, having never studied?«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Jesus answered them, »My teaching is not mine, but his who sent me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">If anyone is willing to do his will, he shall know whether the teaching is from God or whether I speak on my own authority.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">He who speaks from himself seeks his own glory; but he who seeks the glory of the One who sent him is true, and in him there is no falsehood.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Did not Moses give you the law? Yet none of you keeps the law. Why do you seek to kill me?«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">The people answered, »You have a demon. Who is seeking to kill you?«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Jesus answered them, »I did one deed, and you all marvel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Moses therefore gave you circumcision (not that it is from Moses, but from the fathers), and you circumcise a man on the Sabbath.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">If on the Sabbath a man receives circumcision, so that the law of Moses may not be broken, are you angry with me because on the Sabbath I made a man's whole body well?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Do not judge by appearances, but judge with right judgment.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Then some of the people of Jerusalem said, »Is not this the man whom they seek to kill?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Here he is, speaking publicly, and they say nothing to him! Can it be that the authorities really know that he is the Christ?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">But we know where this man is from; when the Christ comes, no one will know where he is from.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Then Jesus cried out, as he taught in the temple, »You know me, and you know where I am from; and I have not come on my own, but he who sent me is true, and him you do not know.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">But I know him, for I am from him, and he sent me.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Then they sought to take him; but no one laid a hand on him, because his hour had not yet come.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">And many of the people believed in him, and they said, »When the Christ comes, will he do more signs than this man has done?«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">The Pharisees heard the crowd muttering these things about him, and the Pharisees and the chief priests sent officers to arrest him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">Then Jesus said to them, »I shall be with you a little while longer, and then I go to him who sent me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">You will seek me, and you will not find me; where I am you cannot come.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">The Jews said to one another, »Where does this man intend to go that we shall not find him? Does he intend to go to the Dispersion among the Greeks and teach the Greeks?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">What does he mean when he said, You will seek me and you will not find me, and, Where I am you cannot come?«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">On the last day, that great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried out, »If anyone thirsts, let him come to me and drink.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">He who believes in me, as the Scripture has said, out of his heart will flow rivers of living water.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">Now this he said about the Spirit, whom those who believed in him were to receive; for as yet the Spirit had not been given, because Jesus was not yet glorified.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">When they heard these words, some of the people said, »Surely this is the prophet.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">Others said, »This is the Christ.« But some said, »Will the Christ come from Galilee?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">Has not the scripture said that the Christ comes from David, and from Bethlehem, the town where David was?«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">So there was a division among the people because of him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">Some of them wanted to seize him, but no one laid hands on him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">The officers then went back to the chief priests and Pharisees, who said to them, »Why did you not bring him?«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">The officers answered, »No man ever spoke like this man!«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">The Pharisees answered them, »Are you deceived, you also?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">Have any of the rulers or of the Pharisees believed in him?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">But this crowd that does not know the law is accursed.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">Nicodemus, who had gone to Jesus before, and who was one of them, said to them,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="51">»Does our law judge a man without first giving him a hearing and learning what he is doing?«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="52">They replied, »Are you from Galilee, too? Search and look, and you will find that no prophet is to rise out of Galilee.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="53">Then each went to his own house.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="8">
      <VERS vnumber="1">But Jesus went to the Mount of Olives.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Early in the morning he came again to the temple; all the people came to him, and he sat down and taught them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Then the scribes and the Pharisees brought to him a woman caught in adultery. And when they had set her in the midst,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">they said to him, »Teacher, this woman was caught in the act of adultery.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Now in the law Moses commanded us to stone such. What do you say?«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">They said this to test him, that they might have something of which to accuse him. But Jesus bent down and wrote on the ground with his finger.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And when they continued to ask him, he stood up and said to them, »Let him who is without sin among you be the first to throw a stone at her.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And again he stooped down and wrote on the ground.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Then those who heard it went away one by one, beginning with the oldest even to the last, and Jesus was left alone, with the woman standing before him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Jesus straightened up and said to her, »Woman, where are they? Has no one condemned you?«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">She said, »No one, Lord.« And Jesus said, »Neither do I condemn you; go, and sin no more.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Again Jesus spoke to them, saying, »I am the light of the world. He who follows me will not walk in darkness, but will have the light of life.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">The Pharisees then said to him, »You are bearing witness of yourself; your testimony is not true.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Jesus answered, »Even if I bear witness of myself, my testimony is true, for I know where I came from and where I am going; but you do not know where I come from and where I am going.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">You judge according to the flesh; I judge no one.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And yet if I do judge, my judgment is true, for I am not alone, but I am with the Father who sent me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">In your own law it is written that the testimony of two men is true.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">I am One who bears witness of myself, and the Father who sent me bears witness of me.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Then they said to him, »Where is your Father?« Jesus answered, »You know neither me nor my Father; if you knew me, you would know my Father also.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">These words he spoke in the treasury, as he taught in the temple; but no one arrested him, because his hour had not yet come.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Then Jesus said to them again, »I am going away, and you will seek me, and will die in your sin. Where I go you cannot come.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Then the Jews said, »Will he kill himself, since he says, Where I go you cannot come?«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">He said to them, »You are from below; I am from above. You are of this world; I am not of this world.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Therefore I told to you that you would die in your sins; for if you do not believe that I am he, you will die in your sins.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">They said to him, »Who are you?« Jesus said to them, »Just what I have been saying to you from the beginning.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">I have much to say about you and much to judge; but he who sent me is true, and I declare to the world what I have heard from him.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">They did not understand that he spoke to them of the Father.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">So Jesus said, »When you have lifted up the Son of man, then you will know that I am he, and that I do nothing on my own authority but speak just what the Father taught me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And he who sent me is with me; he has not left me alone, for I always do what is pleasing to him.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">As he spoke these words, many believed in him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Jesus then said to the Jews who had believed in him, »If you continue in my word, you are truly my disciples.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">And you will know the truth, and the truth will make you free.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">They answered him, »We are Abraham's descendants, and have never been in bondage to anyone. How can you say, You will be made free?«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Jesus answered them, »Truly, truly, I say to you, everyone who commits sin is a slave of sin.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">And a slave does not continue in the house forever, but a son continues forever.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">So if the Son makes you free, you will be free indeed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">I know that you are Abraham's descendants, yet you seek to kill me, because my word has no place in you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">I speak of what I have seen with my Father, and you do what you have heard from your Father.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">They answered him, »Abraham is our father.« Jesus said to them, »If you were Abraham's children, you would do the things Abraham did,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">but now you seek to kill me, a man who has told you the truth which I heard from God. This is not what Abraham did.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">You do the deeds of your father.« They said to him, »We were not born of fornication; we have one Father  God.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">Jesus said to them, »If God were your Father, you would love me, for I proceeded and came forth from God; I have not come of my own accord, but he sent me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">Why do you not understand what I say? It is because you are not able to hear my word.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">You are of your father the devil, and you want to do your father's desires. He was a murderer from the beginning, and does not stand in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he lies, he speaks according to his own nature, for he is a liar and the father of lies.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">But because I tell the truth, you do not believe me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">Which of you convicts me of sin? If I tell the truth, why do you not believe me?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">He who is of God hears the words of God; the reason you do not hear them is that you are not of God.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">The Jews answered him, »Are we not right in saying that you are a Samaritan and have a demon?«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">Jesus answered, »I do not have a demon; but I honor my Father, and you dishonor me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">Yet I do not seek my own glory; there is One who seeks it and he will be the judge.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="51">Truly, truly, I say to you, if anyone keeps my word he will never see death.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="52">The Jews said to him, »Now we know that you have a demon! Abraham died, as did the prophets; and you say, If anyone keeps my word, he will never taste death.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="53">Are you greater than our father Abraham? He died, and so did the prophets. Who do you claim to be?«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="54">Jesus answered, »If I glorify myself, my glory is nothing. It is my Father who glorifies me, of whom you say that he is your God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="55">But you have not known him; I know him. If I said, I do not know him, I would be a liar like you; but I do know him and keep his word.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="56">Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day; he saw it and was glad.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="57">The Jews then said to him, »You are not yet fifty years old, and have you seen Abraham?«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="58">Jesus said to them, »Truly, truly, I say to you, before Abraham was, I am.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="59">So they took up stones to throw at him; but Jesus hid himself, and went out of the temple.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="9">
      <VERS vnumber="1">As he passed by, he saw a man blind from birth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And his disciples asked him, »Rabbi, who sinned, this man or his parents, that he was born blind?«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Jesus answered, »Neither this man sinned nor his parents sinned. But that the works of God might be revealed in him,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">we must work the works of him who sent me, while it is day. Night is coming, when no one can work.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">As he said this, he spat on the ground and made clay of the saliva, and anointed the man's eyes with the clay.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And he said to him, »Go, wash in the pool of Siloam« (which means, Sent). So he went and washed, and came back seeing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">The neighbors and those who had seen him before as a beggar, said, »Is not this the man who used to sit and beg?«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Some said, »It is he.« Others said, »No, but he is like him.« He said, »I am the man.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">They said to him, »Then how were your eyes opened?«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">He answered and said, »A man called Jesus made clay and anointed my eyes and said to me, Go to the pool of Siloam and wash. So I went and washed, and I received sight.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">They said to him, »Where is he?« He said, »I do not know.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">They brought to the Pharisees the man who had formerly been blind.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Now it was a Sabbath day when Jesus made the clay and opened his eyes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Then the Pharisees also asked him again how he had received his sight. He said to them, »He put clay on my eyes, and I washed, and I see.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Some of the Pharisees said, »This man is not from God, for he does not keep the Sabbath.« But others said, »How can a man who is a sinner do such signs?« And there was a division among them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">So they again said to the blind man, »What do you say about him, since he has opened your eyes?« He said, »He is a prophet.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">The Jews did not believe that he had been blind, and had received his sight, until they called the parents of the man who had received his sight.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And they asked them, »Is this your son, who you say was born blind? How then does he now see?«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">His parents answered, »We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">but how he now sees we do not know, nor do we know who opened his eyes. Ask him. He is of age; he will speak for himself.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">His parents said this because they feared the Jews, for the Jews had agreed already that if anyone confessed that he was Christ, he would be put out of the synagogue.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Therefore his parents said, »He is of age; ask him.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">So for the second time they called the man who had been blind, and said to him, »Give God the glory; we know that this man is a sinner.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">He answered, »Whether he is a sinner or not, I do not know. One thing I know, that though I was blind, now I see.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Then they said to him, »What did he do to you? How did he open your eyes?«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">He answered them, »I have told you already and you did not listen. Why do you want to hear it again? Do you want to become his disciples, too?«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Then they reviled him and said, »You are his disciple, but we are disciples of Moses.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">We know that God spoke to Moses, but as for this fellow, we do not know where he comes from.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">The man answered, »Why, this is a marvel! You do not know where he comes from, and yet he opened my eyes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">We know that God does not listen to sinners, but if any one is a worshiper of God and does his will, he listens to him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">Never since the world began has it been heard that anyone opened the eyes of a man born blind.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">If this man were not from God, he could do nothing.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">They answered him, »You were born in utter sin, and are you teaching us?« And they cast him out.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">Jesus heard that they had cast him out, and when he found him, he said, »Do you believe in the Son of Man?«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">He answered, »Who is he, sir, that I may believe in him?«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">Jesus said to him, »You have seen him, and it is he who speaks with you.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">Then he said, »Lord, I believe!« And he worshiped him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">Jesus said, »For judgment I have come into this world, that those who do not see may see, and that those who see may become blind.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">Then some of the Pharisees who were with him heard this, and said to him, »Are we blind also?«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">Jesus said to them, »If you were blind, you would have no guilt; but now that you say, We see, your sin remains.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="14">I am the good shepherd; I know my sheep, and my sheep know me</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">just as the Father knows me and I know the Father; and I lay down my life for the sheep.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And I have other sheep that are not of this fold; I must bring them also, and they will heed my voice. So there shall be one flock and one shepherd.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">For this reason my Father loves me, because I lay down my life, that I may take it again.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">No one takes it from me, but I lay it down of my own accord. I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again. This command I have received from my Father.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">There was again a division among the Jews because of these words.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Many of them said, »He has a demon, and is mad. Why listen to him?«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Others said, »These are not the sayings of one who has a demon. Can a demon open the eyes of the blind?«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Then came the Feast of Dedication at Jerusalem. It was winter,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">and Jesus was in the temple, walking in Solomon's Porch.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">So the Jews gathered round him and said to him, »How long will you keep us in suspense? If you are the Christ, tell us plainly.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Jesus answered them, »I told you, and you do not believe. The works that I do in my Father's name, they bear witness of me;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">but you do not believe, because you are not of my sheep.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">I give them eternal life, and they shall never perish; no one shall snatch them out of my hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">My Father, who has given them to me, is greater than all; and no one is able to snatch them out of my Father's hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">I and the Father are one.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">The Jews took up stones again to stone him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">Jesus answered them, »I have shown you many good works from the Father. For which of these do you stone me?«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">The Jews answered him, »For a good work we do not stone you, but for blasphemy, and because you, being a man, make yourself God.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Jesus answered them, »Is it not written in your law, I said, you are gods?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">If he called them gods, to whom the word of God came (and the Scripture cannot be broken),</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">do you say of him whom the Father sanctified and sent into the world, You are blaspheming, because I said, I am the Son of God?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">If I do not do the works of my father, do not believe me;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">but if I do them, even though you do not believe me, believe the works, that you may know and understand that the Father is in me, and I am in the Father.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">Again they tried to seize him, but he escaped from their hands.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">He went away again across the Jordan to the place where John was baptizing at first, and there he stayed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">And many came to him and they said, »John performed no sign, but all that John said about this man was true.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">And many believed in him there.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="11">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now a certain man was sick, Lazarus of Bethany, the village of Mary and her sister Martha.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">It was this Mary who anointed the Lord with fragrant oil and wiped his feet with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was sick.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">So the sisters sent to him, saying, »Lord, he whom you love is sick.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">When Jesus heard it, he said, »This sickness is not unto death, but for the glory of God, so that the Son of God may be glorified through it.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Now Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">So, when he heard that he was sick, he stayed two more days in the place where he was.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Then after this he said to the disciples, »Let us go to Judea again.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">The disciples said to him, »Rabbi, the Jews were just now seeking to stone you, and are you going there again?«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Jesus answered, »Are there not twelve hours in the day? If anyone walks in the day, he does not stumble, because he sees the light of this world.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">But if one walks in the night, he stumbles, because the light is not in him.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">These things he said, and after that he said to them, »Our friend Lazarus has fallen asleep, but I go to wake him up.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">His disciples said, »Lord, if he sleeps, he will recover.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Now Jesus had spoken of his death, but they thought that he meant taking rest in sleep.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">So then Jesus told them plainly, »Lazarus is dead;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">and for your sake I am glad that I was not there, so that you may believe. But let us go to him.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Then Thomas, who is called the Twin, said to his fellow disciples, »Let us also go, that we may die with him.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">So when Jesus came, he found that he had already been in the tomb four days.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Bethany was near Jerusalem, about two miles off,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">and many of the Jews had come to Martha and Mary to comfort them concerning their brother.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">When Martha heard that Jesus was coming, she went and met him, but Mary sat in the house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Martha said to Jesus, »Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">But even now I know that whatever you ask of God, God will give you.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Jesus said to her, »Your brother will rise again.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Martha said to him, »I know that he will rise again in the resurrection at the last day.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Jesus said to her, »I am the resurrection and the life. He who believes in me, though he die, yet shall he live;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">and whoever lives and believes in me shall never die. Do you believe this?«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">She said to him, »Yes, Lord, I believe that you are the Christ, the Son of God, who is to come into the world.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And when she had said this, she went her way and called Mary her sister, saying, »The Teacher is here and is calling for you.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">When she heard it, she rose quickly and went to him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Now Jesus had not yet come to the village, but was still in the place where Martha had met him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">The Jews who were with her in the house, and comforting her, when they saw that Mary rose up quickly and went out, followed her, supposing that she was going to the tomb to weep there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">Then Mary, when she came where Jesus was and saw him, fell at his feet, saying to him, »Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">When Jesus saw her weeping, and the Jews who came with her also weeping, he was deeply moved in spirit and troubled.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">And he said, »Where have you laid him?« They said to him, »Lord, come and see.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">Jesus wept.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">Then the Jews said, »See how he loved him!«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">But some of them said, »Could not he who opened the eyes of the blind man have kept this man from dying?«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">Then Jesus, deeply moved again, came to the tomb. It was a cave, and a stone lay against it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">Jesus said, »Take away the stone.« Martha, the sister of the dead man, said to him, »Lord, by this time there is a bad odor, for he has been dead four days.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">Jesus said to her, »Did I not tell you that if you would believe you would see the glory of God?«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">So they took away the stone. And Jesus lifted up his eyes and said, »Father, I thank you that you have heard me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">I knew that you always hear me, but I said this for the benefit of the people standing by, that they may believe that you sent me.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">When he had said this, he cried with a loud voice, »Lazarus, come out!«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">The dead man came out, his hands and feet bound with grave clothes, and his face wrapped with a cloth. Jesus said to them, »Unbind him, and let him go.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">Many of the Jews therefore, who had come to Mary and had seen what Jesus did, believed in him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">But some of them went to the Pharisees and told them what Jesus had done.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">Then the chief priests and the Pharisees gathered a council, and said, »What are we to do? For this man performs many signs.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">If we let him go on like this, everyone will believe in him, and the Romans will come and take away both our place and our nation.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">But one of them, Caiaphas, who was high priest that year, said to them, »You know nothing at all!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">You do not understand that it is expedient for you that one man should die for the people, and that the whole nation not perish.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="51">He did not say this on his own, but being high priest that year he prophesied that Jesus would die for the nation,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="52">and not for that nation only, but also that he would gather together into one the children of God who were scattered abroad.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="53">So from that day on they plotted to put him to death.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="54">Jesus therefore no longer went about openly among the Jews, but went from there to the country near the wilderness, to a town called Ephraim; and there he stayed with his disciples.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="55">Now the Passover of the Jews was at hand, and many went from the country up to Jerusalem before the Passover, to purify themselves.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="56">They were looking for Jesus and saying to one another as they stood in the temple, »What do you think? That he will not come to the feast?«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="57">Now the chief priests and the Pharisees had given orders that if anyone knew where he was, he should report it, so that they might arrest him.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="12">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Then, six days before the Passover, Jesus came to Bethany where Lazarus was, whom Jesus had raised from the dead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">There they made him a supper; and Martha served, while Lazarus was one of those who sat at the table with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Then Mary took a pound of very costly perfume of pure nard, anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped his feet with her hair. And the house was filled with the fragrance of the perfume.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">But one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot, who was later to betray him, said,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">»Why was this perfume not sold for three hundred denarii and given to the poor?«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">This he said, not that he cared for the poor, but because he was a thief; and as he had the money box, he used to take what was put into it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Jesus said, »Let her alone, she has kept this for the day of my burial.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">The poor you always have with you, but you do not always have me.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Now a great crowd of the Jews learned that he was there, and they came, not only on account of Jesus but also to see Lazarus, whom he had raised from the dead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">So the chief priests planned to put Lazarus also to death,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">because on account of him many of the Jews were going away and believing in Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">The next day a great crowd that had come to the feast heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">They took branches of palm trees and went out to meet him, crying, <STYLE css="display:block;text-indent:5mm">»Hosanna!</STYLE><STYLE css="display:block;text-indent:5mm">Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!</STYLE><STYLE css="display:block;text-indent:10mm">The King of Israel!«</STYLE></VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Jesus found a young donkey and sat upon it, as it is written,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">
        <STYLE css="display:block;text-indent:5mm">»Fear not, daughter of Zion;</STYLE>
        <STYLE css="display:block;text-indent:5mm">behold, your King is coming,</STYLE>
        <STYLE css="display:block;text-indent:10mm">sitting on a donkey's colt.«</STYLE>
      </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">His disciples did not understand this at first; but when Jesus was glorified, then they remembered that these things had been written about him and that they had done these things to him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">The crowd that had been with him when he called Lazarus out of the tomb and raised him from the dead bore witness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">For this reason the people went to meet him, because they heard that he had done this sign.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">The Pharisees then said to one another, »You see that you are accomplishing nothing. Look, The world has gone after him!«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Now there were some Greeks among those who went up to worship at the Feast.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Then they came to Philip, who was from Bethsaida in Galilee, and said to him, »Sir, we wish to see Jesus.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Philip went and told Andrew; and in turn Andrew and Philip told Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Jesus answered them, »The hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Truly, truly, I say to you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it remains alone; but if it dies, it produces much fruit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">He who loves his life will lose it, and he who hates his life in this world will keep it for eternal life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">If anyone serves me, he must follow me; and where I am, there my servant will be also. If anyone serves me, him my Father will honor.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">»Now is my soul troubled, and what shall I say? Father, save me from this hour? No, for this purpose I came to this hour.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Father, glorify your name.« Then a voice came from heaven, »I have glorified it, and I will glorify it again.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">The crowd standing by heard it and said that it had thundered. Others said, »An angel has spoken to him.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Jesus answered, »This voice has come for your sake, not for mine.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Now is the judgment of this world; now the ruler of this world will be cast out.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">And I, when I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all men to myself.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">He said this to show by what death he was to die.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">The crowd answered him, »We have heard from the Law that the Christ remains forever; and how can you say, The Son of Man must be lifted up? Who is this Son of Man?«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">Then Jesus said to them, »A little while longer the light is with you. Walk while you have the light, lest the darkness overtake you; he who walks in the darkness does not know where he is going.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">While you have the light, believe in the light, that you may become sons of light.« <STYLE css="display:block;text-indent:5mm">When Jesus had said this, he departed and hid himself from them.</STYLE></VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">Though he had done so many signs before them, yet they did not believe in him;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">that the word of Isaiah the prophet might be fulfilled, which he spoke: <STYLE css="display:block;text-indent:5mm">»Lord, who has believed our report?</STYLE><STYLE css="display:block;text-indent:10mm">And to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?«</STYLE></VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">Therefore they could not believe, because Isaiah said again:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">
        <STYLE css="display:block;text-indent:5mm">»He has blinded their eyes</STYLE>
        <STYLE css="display:block;text-indent:10mm">and hardened their hearts,</STYLE>

        <STYLE css="display:block;text-indent:5mm">so that I should heal them.«</STYLE>
      </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">Isaiah said this because he saw his glory and spoke of him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">Nevertheless even among the rulers many believed in him, but because of the Pharisees they did not confess him, lest they should be put out of the synagogue;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">for they loved the praise of men more than the praise of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">Then Jesus cried out and said, »He who believes in me, believes not in me but in him who sent me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">And he who sees me sees him who sent me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">I have come as a light into the world, that whoever believes in me should not remain in darkness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">If anyone hears my words and does not keep them, I do not judge him; for I did not come to judge the world but to save the world.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">He who rejects me and does not receive my words has a judge; the word that I have spoken will condemn him on the last day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">For I have not spoken on my own authority; but the Father who sent me gave me a command, what to say and what to speak.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">And I know that his command is eternal life. Whatever I say, therefore, I say just as the Father has told me.«</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="13">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now before the feast of the Passover, when Jesus knew that his hour had come to depart from this world to the Father, having loved his own who were in the world, he loved them to the end.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And during supper, when the devil had already put it into the heart of Judas Iscariot, Simon's son, to betray him,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Jesus, knowing that the Father had given all things into his hands, and that he had come from God and was going to God,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">rose from supper, laid aside his garments, took a towel and girded himself.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">After that, he poured water into a basin and began to wash the disciples' feet, and to wipe them with the towel with which he was girded.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Then he came to Simon Peter. And Peter said to him, »Lord, are you going to wash my feet?«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Jesus answered him, »You do not realize now what I am doing, but later you will understand.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Peter said to him, »You shall never wash my feet.« Jesus answered him, »If I do not wash you, you have no part with me.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Simon Peter said to him, »Lord, not my feet only, but also my hands and my head!«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Jesus said to him, »He who has bathed needs only to wash his feet, but is completely clean; and you are clean, but not every one of you.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">For he knew who was to betray him; that was why he said, »You are not all clean.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">When he had washed their feet, and taken his garments, and returned to his place, he said to them, »Do you know what I have done to you?</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="22">The disciples looked at one another, uncertain of whom he spoke.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">One of his disciples, whom Jesus loved, was leaning close to the breast of Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Simon Peter motioned to him and said, »Ask who it is of whom he speaks.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Then, leaning back on the breast of Jesus, he said to him, »Lord, who is it?«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Jesus answered, »It is he to whom I shall give this piece of bread when I have dipped it.« And having dipped the bread, he gave it to Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Then after the bread, Satan entered into him. Jesus said to him, »What you are going to do, do quickly.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">But no one at the table knew why he said this to him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Some thought that, because Judas had the money box, Jesus was telling him, »Buy what we need for the feast«; or, that he should give something to the poor.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Having received the piece of bread, he went out immediately. And it was night.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">When Jesus had spoken these words, he went out with his disciples over the Kidron valley, where there was a garden, which he and his disciples entered.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Now Judas, who betrayed him, also knew the place; for Jesus often met there with his disciples.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">So Judas, having received a detachment of soldiers and some officers from the chief priests and the Pharisees, came there with lanterns, torches, and weapons.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Then Jesus, knowing all that was to come upon him, went forward and said to them, »Whom do you seek?«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">They answered him, »Jesus of Nazareth.« Jesus said to them, »I am he.« And Judas, who betrayed him, was standing with them.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="7">Again he asked them, »Whom do you seek?« And they said, »Jesus of Nazareth.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Jesus answered, »I told you that I am he. So, if you seek me, let these men go.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">This happened so that the words which he had spoken would be fulfilled, »Of those whom you gave me I have lost none.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Then Simon Peter, having a sword, drew it and struck the high priests servant, and cut off his right ear. The servants name was Malchus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Jesus said to Peter, »Put your sword into its sheath; shall I not drink the cup which the Father has given me?«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Then the detachment of soldiers and their captain and the officers of the Jews arrested Jesus and bound him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And they led him to Annas first; for he was the father-in-law of Caiaphas, who was high priest that year.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Now it was Caiaphas who had advised the Jews that it was expedient that one man should die for the people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Simon Peter followed Jesus, and so did another disciple. As this disciple was known to the high priest, he went with Jesus into the courtyard of the high priest.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">But Peter stood at the door outside. Then the other disciple, who was known to the high priest, went out and spoke to the girl who kept the door, and brought Peter in.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Then the girl who kept the door said to Peter, »You are not also one of this mans disciples, are you?« He said, »I am not.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Now the servants and officers had made a charcoal fire, because it was cold, and they were standing and warming themselves. Peter also was with them, standing and warming himself.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">The high priest then questioned Jesus about his disciples and his teaching.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Jesus answered him, »I have spoken openly to the world. I always taught in synagogues and in the temple, where all the Jews come together, and I have said nothing in secret.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Why do you ask me? Ask those who have heard me what I said to them. They know what I said.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And when he had said this, one of the officers standing by struck Jesus with his hand, saying, »Is that the way you answer the high priest?«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Jesus answered him, »If I have spoken wrongly, bear witness to the wrong; but if I have spoken rightly, why do you strike me?«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Then Annas sent him bound to Caiaphas the high priest.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Now Simon Peter stood warming himself. Therefore they said to him, »You are not also one of his disciples, are you?« He denied it and said, »I am not.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">One of the servants of the high priest, a relative of him whose ear Peter had cut off, said, »Did I not see you in the garden with him?«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Peter again denied it; and at once a rooster crowed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Then they led Jesus from Caiaphas to the Praetorium, and it was early morning. But they did not enter the Praetorium themselves, so that they might not be defiled, but might eat the Passover.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">So Pilate went out to them and said, »What accusation do you bring against this man?«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">They answered him, »If he were not an evildoer, we would not have handed him over to you.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Pilate said to them, »Take him yourselves and judge him by your own law.« The Jews said to him, »It is not lawful for us to put anyone to death.«</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="33">Then Pilate entered the Praetorium again, called Jesus, and said to him, »Are you the King of the Jews?«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Jesus answered, »Do you say this on your own, or did others say it to you about me?«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">Pilate answered, »Am I a Jew? Your own nation and the chief priests have handed you over to me; what have you done?«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">Jesus answered, »My kingdom is not of this world. If my kingdom were of this world, my servants would fight, so that I should not be delivered to the Jews; but now my kingship is not from here.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">Pilate said to him, »You are a king then?« Jesus answered, »You say what I ama king. For this I was born, and for this I have come into the world, to bear witness to the truth. Everyone who is of the truth hears my voice.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">Pilate said to him, »What is truth?« <STYLE css="display:block;text-indent:5mm">After he had said this, he went out to the Jews again, and told them, »I find no crime in him.</STYLE></VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">So then Pilate took Jesus and scourged him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And the soldiers twisted a crown of thorns and put it on his head, and they clothed him in a purple robe.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">They came up to him, saying, »Hail, King of the Jews!« and struck him with their hands.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Pilate went out again, and said to them, »See, I am bringing him out to you, that you may know that I find no crime in him.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">So Jesus came out, wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe. Pilate said to them, »Behold the man!«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">When the chief priests and officers saw him, they cried out, »Crucify him, crucify him!« Pilate said to them, »You take him and crucify him, for I find no fault in him.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">The Jews answered him, »We have a law, and according to that law he ought to die, because he made himself the Son of God.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">When Pilate heard these words, he was the more afraid,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">and he went again into the Praetorium and said to Jesus, »Where are you from?« But Jesus gave him no answer.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Pilate said to him, »You will not speak to me? Do you not know that I have power to release you, and power to crucify you?«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Jesus answered, »You would have no power over me unless it had been given you from above. Therefore the one who delivered me to you has the greater sin.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">From then on Pilate sought to release him, but the Jews cried out, »If you let this man go, you are not Caesars friend. Anyone who makes himself a king sets himself against Caesar.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">When Pilate heard these words, he brought Jesus out, and sat down on the judgment seat at a place that is called The Pavement, but in Hebrew, Gabbatha.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Now it was the day of Preparation of the Passover, about the sixth hour. And he said to the Jews, »Behold your King!«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">But they cried out, »Away with him! Away with him! Crucify him!« Pilate said to them, »Shall I crucify your King?« The chief priests answered, »We have no King but Caesar.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Then he handed him over to them to be crucified. <STYLE css="display:block;text-indent:5mm">So they took Jesus.</STYLE></VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And he, bearing his cross, went out to a place called the Place of the Skull, which is called in Hebrew, Golgotha.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">There they crucified him, and two others with him, one on either side, and Jesus in the center.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Pilate wrote a title and put it on the cross. It read: <STYLE css="display:block;text-indent:5mm">JESUS OF NAZARETH, THE KING OF THE JEWS.</STYLE></VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Many of the Jews read this title, for the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city; and it was written in Hebrew, Greek, and Latin.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">The chief priests of the Jews then said to Pilate, »Do not write, The King of the Jews, but, This man said, I am King of the Jews.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Pilate answered, »What I have written, I have written.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">When the soldiers had crucified Jesus, they took his garments, and made four parts, one for each soldier, and also his tunic. Now the tunic was without seam, woven in one piece from top to bottom.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">So they said to one another, »Let us not tear it, but cast lots for it, whose it shall be.« This happened that the Scripture might be fulfilled which says: <STYLE css="display:block;text-indent:5mm">»They divided my garments among them,</STYLE><STYLE css="display:block;text-indent:10mm">and for my clothing they cast lots.«</STYLE><STYLE css="display:block;text-indent:5mm">This is what the soldiers did.</STYLE></VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="26">When Jesus saw his mother, and the disciple whom he loved standing by, he said to his mother, »Woman, behold your son!«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Then he said to the disciple, »Behold, your mother!« And from that hour the disciple took her to his own home.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">After this, Jesus, knowing that all was now accomplished, that the Scripture might be fulfilled, said, »I thirst.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Now a vessel full of wine vinegar was sitting there; so they filled a sponge with the vinegar, put it on hyssop, and put it to his mouth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">So when Jesus had received the vinegar, he said, »It is finished!« And he bowed his head and gave up his spirit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Therefore, because it was the day of Preparation, that the bodies should not remain on the cross on the Sabbath (for that Sabbath was a high day), the Jews asked Pilate that their legs might be broken, and that they might be taken away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">Then the soldiers came and broke the legs of the first, and of the other who had been crucified with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">But when they came to Jesus and saw that he was already dead, they did not break his legs.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">But one of the soldiers pierced his side with a spear, and immediately blood and water came out.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">He who saw it has testified, and his testimony is true, and he knows that he tells the truth, that you also may believe.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">For these things were done that the scripture should be fulfilled, »Not one of his bones shall be broken.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">And again another scripture says, »They shall look on him whom they have pierced.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">After this Joseph of Arimathea, who was a disciple of Jesus, but secretly, for fear of the Jews, asked Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus, and Pilate gave him permission. So he came and took away his body.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">And Nicodemus, who had at first come to Jesus by night, also came, bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about a hundred pounds.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">So they took the body of Jesus, and bound it in strips of linen with the spices, as is the burial custom of the Jews.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">Now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden, and in the garden a new tomb in which no one had ever been laid.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">So because of the Jewish day of Preparation, as the tomb was nearby, they laid Jesus there.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="20">
      <VERS vnumber="1">On the first day of the week Mary Magdalene went to the tomb early, while it was still dark, and saw that the stone had been taken away from the tomb.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">So she ran, and came to Simon Peter and the other disciple, the one whom Jesus loved, and said to them, »They have taken the Lord out of the tomb, and we do not know where they have laid him.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Peter therefore went out with the other disciple, and they were going toward the tomb.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">They both ran, but the other disciple outran Peter and reached the tomb first.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And stooping to look in, he saw the linen cloths lying there, but he did not go in.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Then Simon Peter came, following him, and went into the tomb; and he saw the linen cloths lying there,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">and the napkin that had been around his head, not lying with the linen cloths, but folded up in a place by itself.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Then the other disciple, who reached the tomb first, also went in; and he saw and believed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">For as yet they did not know the Scripture, that he must rise from the dead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Then the disciples went back to their homes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">But Mary stood weeping outside the tomb, and as she wept she stooped to look into the tomb.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And she saw two angels in white, sitting where the body of Jesus had lain, one at the head and the other at the feet.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">They said to her, »Woman, why are you weeping?« She said to them, »Because they have taken away my Lord, and I do not know where they have laid him.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Saying this, she turned around and saw Jesus standing there, but she did not know that it was Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Jesus said to her, »Woman, why are you weeping? Whom are you seeking?« Supposing him to be the gardener, she said to him, »Sir, if you have carried him away, tell me where you have laid him, and I will take him away.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Jesus said to her, »Mary!« She turned and said to him in Hebrew, »Rabboni!« (which means, Teacher).</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Jesus said to her, »Do not hold me, for I have not yet ascended to the Father; but go to my brethren and say to them, »I am ascending to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Mary Magdalene went and said to the disciples, »I have seen the Lord!« And she told them that he had said these things to her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">On the evening of that day, the first day of the week, the doors being shut where the disciples were, for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood among them and said to them, »Peace be with you.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">When he had said this, he showed them his hands and his side. Then the disciples were glad when they saw the Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Jesus said to them again, »Peace be with you! As the Father has sent me, I also send you.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And when he had said this, he breathed on them, and said to them, »Receive the Holy Spirit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">If you forgive the sins of any, they are forgiven them; if you retain the sins of any, they are retained.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Now Thomas, one of the twelve, called the Twin, was not with them when Jesus came.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">So the other disciples told him, »We have seen the Lord.« But he said to them, »Unless I see in his hands the print of the nails, and put my finger in the mark of the nails, and put my hand in his side, I will not believe.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Eight days later, his disciples were again in the house, and Thomas was with them. The doors were shut, but Jesus came and stood among them, and said, »Peace be with you!«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Then he said to Thomas, »Put your finger here, and see my hands. Reach out your hand, and put it into my side; do not be unbelieving, but believing.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Thomas answered him, »My Lord and my God!«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Jesus said to him, »Have you believed because you have seen me? Blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Jesus did many other signs in the presence of his disciples, which are not written in this book;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">but these are written that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing you may have life in his name.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="21">
      <VERS vnumber="1">After this Jesus showed himself again to the disciples by the Sea of Tiberias, and in this way he showed himself:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Simon Peter, Thomas called the Twin, Nathanael of Cana in Galilee, the sons of Zebedee, and two others of his disciples were together.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Simon Peter said to them, »I am going fishing.« They said to him, »We will go with you.« They went out and got into the boat; but that night they caught nothing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">But early in the morning, Jesus stood on the shore; yet the disciples did not know that it was Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Jesus said to them, »Children, have you any fish?« They answered him, »No.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">He said to them, »Cast the net on the right side of the boat, and you will find some.« So they cast, and now they were not able to haul it in because of the great number of fish.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Then that disciple whom Jesus loved said to Peter, »It is the Lord!« Now when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he put on his outer garment (for he had removed it), and threw himself into the sea.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">But the other disciples came in the boat, dragging the net full of fish, for they were not far from land, but about a hundred yards off.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">When they had come to land, they saw a fire of coals there, with fish lying on it, and bread.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Jesus said to them, »Bring some of the fish you have just caught.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Simon Peter went aboard and dragged the net ashore, full of large fish, one hundred and fifty-three; and although there were so many, the net was not torn.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Jesus said to them, »Come and have breakfast.« Now none of the disciples dared ask him, »Who are you?« They knew it was the Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Jesus came and took the bread and gave it to them, and did the same with the fish.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">This was now the third time Jesus appeared to his disciples after he was raised from the dead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">When they had finished breakfast, Jesus said to Simon Peter, »Simon, son of John, do you love me more than these?« He said to him, »Yes, Lord; you know that I love you.« He said to him, »Feed my lambs.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">He said to him again a second time, »Simon, son of John, do you love me?« He said to him, »Yes, Lord; you know that I love you.« He said to him, »Tend my sheep.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">He said to him the third time, »Simon, son of John, do you love me?« Peter was grieved because he said to him the third time, »Do you love me?« And he said to him, »Lord, you know all things; you know that I love you.« Jesus said to him, »Feed my sheep.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Truly, truly, I say to you, when you were younger, you girded yourself and walked where you wished; but when you are old, you will stretch out your hands, and another will gird you and carry you where you do not wish to go.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">This he said to show by what death he would glorify God. And after this he said to him, »Follow me.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Peter turned and saw following them the disciple whom Jesus loved, who had leaned on his breast at the supper and had said, »Lord, who is the one who is going to betray you?«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">When Peter saw him, he said to Jesus, »Lord, what about this man?«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Jesus said to him, »If I want him to remain until I come, what is that to you? You follow me.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Then the saying spread among the brethren that this disciple would not die. Yet Jesus did not say to him that he would not die, but, »If I want him to remain until I come, what is that to you?«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">This is the disciple who testifies to these things, and who wrote these things; and we know that his testimony is true.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">But there are also many other things which Jesus did. If every one of them were to be written, I suppose that even the world itself could not contain the books that would be written.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
  </BIBLEBOOK>
  <BIBLEBOOK bnumber="44">
    <CHAPTER cnumber="1">
      <VERS vnumber="1">In the first book, O Theophilus, I wrote about all that Jesus began to do and to teach,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">until the day when he was taken up to heaven, after he had given orders through the Holy Spirit to the apostles whom he had chosen.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">To these he also presented himself alive after his suffering, by many convincing proofs, appearing to them over a period of forty days and speaking of the things concerning the kingdom of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And while staying with them, he commanded them not to leave Jerusalem, but to wait for what the Father had promised, »Which,« he said, »you heard of from me;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">for John baptized with water, but before many days you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">So when they had come together, they asked him, »Lord, are you at this time going to restore the kingdom to Israel?«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">He said to them, »It is not for you to know times or seasons which the Father has fixed by his own authority.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you; and you shall be my witnesses both in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and even to the ends of the earth.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And after he had said this, as they were looking on, he was lifted up, and a cloud took him out of their sight.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And as they were gazing intently into the sky while he was going, behold, two men in white clothing stood beside them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">They also said, »Men of Galilee, why do you stand looking into the sky? This Jesus, who has been taken up from you into heaven, will come in just the same way as you have watched him go into heaven.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Then they returned to Jerusalem from the mount called Olivet, which is near Jerusalem, a Sabbath day's journey away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And when they had entered, they went up to the upper room, where they were staying; Peter and John and James and Andrew, Philip and Thomas, Bartholomew and Matthew, James the son of Alphaeus and Simon the Zealot and Judas the son of James.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">All these with one mind devoted themselves to prayer, along with the women and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with his brothers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">In those days Peter stood up among the brethren (the company of persons was in all about a hundred and twenty), and said,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">»Brethren, the scripture had to be fulfilled, which the Holy Spirit spoke beforehand by the mouth of David, concerning Judas who was guide to those who arrested Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">For he was counted among us and received his share in this ministry.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">(Now this man bought a field with the reward of his wickedness; and falling headlong, he burst open in the middle and all his intestines gushed out.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And it became known to all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so that the field was called in their language Akeldama, that is, Field of Blood.)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">For it is written in the book of Psalms, <STYLE css="display:block;text-indent:5mm">Let his homestead be made desolate,</STYLE><STYLE css="display:block;text-indent:10mm">and let there be no one to dwell in it;</STYLE> and, <STYLE css="display:block;text-indent:5mm">let another man take his office.</STYLE></VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Therefore it is necessary that of the men who have accompanied us all the time that the Lord Jesus went in and out among us,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">beginning from the baptism of John until the day when he was taken up from usone of these men must become with us a witness to his resurrection.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">So they put forward two men, Joseph called Barsabbas (who was also called Justus), and Matthias.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And they prayed and said, »You, Lord, who know the hearts of all men, show which one of these two you have chosen</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">to take the place in this ministry and apostleship from which Judas turned aside, to go to his own place.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And they cast lots for them, and the lot fell to Matthias; and he was added to the eleven apostles.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="2">
      <VERS vnumber="1">When the day of Pentecost had come, they were all together in one place.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And suddenly there came from heaven a sound like the rush of a violent wind, and it filled the whole house where they were sitting.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And there appeared to them tongues as of fire distributing themselves, and they rested on each one of them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Now there were Jews living in Jerusalem, devout men from every nation under heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And at this sound the crowd came together, and they were bewildered, because each one heard them speaking in his own language.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">They were amazed and wondered, saying, »Are not all these who are speaking Galileans?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And how is it that we hear them, each of us in his own native language?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Parthians and Medes and Elamites, and residents of Mesopotamia, Judea and Cappadocia, Pontus and Asia,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="12">And they were all amazed and perplexed, saying to one another, »What does this mean?«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">But others were mocking and said, »They are full of sweet wine.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">But Peter, taking his stand with the eleven, raised his voice and addressed them: »Men of Judea and all you who live in Jerusalem, let this be known to you and give heed to my words.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="16">The people also gathered from the towns around Jerusalem, bringing the sick and those afflicted with unclean spirits, and they were all healed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">But the high priest rose up and all who were with him, that is, the party of the Sadducees, and they were filled with jealousy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">They arrested the apostles and put them in the public jail.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">But during the night an angel of the Lord opened the doors of the prison, and brought them out, and said,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="36">For some time ago Theudas rose up, claiming to be somebody, and a group of about four hundred men joined him. But he was killed, and all who followed him were dispersed and came to nothing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">After this man, Judas the Galilean rose up in the days of the census and drew away some people after him; he too perished, and all those who followed him were scattered.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="58">Then they cast him out of the city and began to stone him; and the witnesses laid down their garments at the feet of a young man named Saul.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="59">And as they were stoning Stephen, he prayed, »Lord Jesus, receive my spirit.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="60">Then he fell on his knees and cried out with a loud voice, »Lord, do not hold this sin against them.« And when he had said this, he fell asleep.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="8">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Saul was consenting to his death. <STYLE css="display:block;text-indent:5mm">And on that day a great persecution arose against the church in Jerusalem, and they were all scattered throughout the region of Judea and Samaria, except the apostles.</STYLE></VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Devout men buried Stephen, and made great lamentation over him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">But Saul began ravaging the church, and, entering house after house, he dragged off men and women and put them in prison.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Now those who had been scattered went about preaching the word.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Philip went down to a city of Samaria and proclaimed Christ to them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">The crowds with one accord were giving attention to what was said by Philip, when they heard and saw the signs which he did.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">For unclean spirits, crying with a loud voice, came out of many who were possessed; and many who were paralyzed and lame were healed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">So there was much joy in that city.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Now there was a man named Simon, who had formerly practiced magic in the city and amazed all the people of Samaria. He boasted that he was someone great,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">and they all, from the least to the greatest, gave attention to him, saying, »This man is what is called the Great Power of God.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And they gave heed to him, because for a long time he had amazed them with his magic.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">But when they believed Philip as he preached good news about the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Even Simon himself believed, and after being baptized he continued with Philip. And seeing signs and great miracles performed, he was amazed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Now when the apostles in Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent them Peter and John,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">who came down and prayed for them that they might receive the Holy Spirit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">For he had not yet fallen upon any of them; they had simply been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Then they laid their hands on them, and they received the Holy Spirit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Now when Simon saw that the Spirit was given through the laying on of the apostles' hands, he offered them money,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">saying, »Give me also this power, so that everyone on whom I lay my hands may receive the Holy Spirit.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">But Peter said to him, »May your silver perish with you, because you thought you could obtain the gift of God with money!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">You have no part or share in this matter, for your heart is not right before God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Repent therefore of this wickedness of yours, and pray to the Lord that, if possible, the intent of your heart may be forgiven you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">For I see that you are in the gall of bitterness and in the bond of iniquity.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And Simon answered, »Pray for me to the Lord, so that nothing of what you have said may come upon me.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Now when they had testified and spoken the word of the Lord, they returned to Jerusalem, preaching the gospel to many villages of the Samaritans.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">But an angel of the Lord said to Philip, »Get up and go toward the south to the road that goes down from Jerusalem to Gaza.« This is a desert road.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">So he got up and went. And there was an Ethiopian eunuch, a court official of Candace, queen of the Ethiopians, who was in charge of all her treasure; and he had come to Jerusalem to worship,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">and he was returning and sitting in his chariot, and was reading the prophet Isaiah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And the Spirit said to Philip, »Go up and join this chariot.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">So Philip ran up to him, and heard him reading Isaiah the prophet, and asked, »Do you understand what you are reading?«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">And he said, »How can I, unless someone guides me?« And he invited Philip to come up and sit with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">Now the passage of Scripture which he was reading was this: <STYLE css="display:block;text-indent:5mm">»He was led as a sheep to slaughter;</STYLE><STYLE css="display:block;text-indent:10mm">and as a lamb before its shearer is silent,</STYLE><STYLE css="display:block;text-indent:15mm">so he does not open his mouth.</STYLE></VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">
        <STYLE css="display:block;text-indent:5mm">In his humiliation justice was denied him.</STYLE>
        <STYLE css="display:block;text-indent:10mm">Who can describe his generation?</STYLE>
        <STYLE css="display:block;text-indent:15mm">For his life is taken up from the earth.«</STYLE>
      </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">And the eunuch said to Philip, »Please tell me, of whom does the prophet say this, about himself or about someone else?«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">Then Philip opened his mouth, and beginning with this scripture he told him the good news of Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">And as they went along the road they came to some water; and the eunuch said, »Look, here is water! What prevents me from being baptized?«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">
      </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">And he commanded the chariot to stop, and they both went down into the water, Philip and the eunuch, and he baptized him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">And when they came up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord snatched Philip away; and the eunuch saw him no more, but went on his way rejoicing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">But Philip found himself at Azotus, and as he passed through he kept preaching the gospel to all the towns until he came to Caesarea.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="9">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now Saul, still breathing threats and murder against the disciples of the Lord, went to the high priest,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">and asked for letters from him to the synagogues at Damascus, so that if he found any belonging to the Way, both men and women, he might bring them bound to Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Now as he journeyed he approached Damascus, and suddenly a light from heaven flashed around him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And he fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to him, »Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me?«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And he said, »Who are you, Lord?« And he said, »I am Jesus whom you are persecuting,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">but get up and enter the city, and it will be told you what you must do.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">The men who were traveling with him stood speechless, hearing the voice but seeing no one.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Saul got up from the ground; and when his eyes were opened, he could see nothing; so they led him by the hand and brought him into Damascus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And for three days he was without sight, and neither ate nor drank.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Now there was a disciple at Damascus named Ananias; and the Lord said to him in a vision, »Ananias.« And he said, »Here I am, Lord.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And the Lord said to him, »Get up and go to the street called Straight, and inquire at the house of Judas for a man from Tarsus named Saul, for he is praying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">and in a vision he has seen a man named Ananias come in and lay his hands on him so that he might regain his sight.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">But Ananias answered, »Lord, I have heard from many about this man, how much harm he has done to your saints at Jerusalem;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">and here he has authority from the chief priests to bind all who call on your name.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">But the Lord said to him, »Go, for he is a chosen instrument of mine to carry my name before the Gentiles and kings and the sons of Israel;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">for I will show him how much he must suffer for the sake of my name.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">So Ananias departed and entered the house. And after laying his hands on him said, »Brother Saul, the Lord Jesus, who appeared to you on the road by which you were coming, has sent me so that you may regain your sight and be filled with the Holy Spirit.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And immediately there fell from his eyes something like scales, and he regained his sight. And he got up and was baptized,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">and he took food and was strengthened. <STYLE css="display:block;text-indent:5mm">Now for several days he was with the disciples who were at Damascus.</STYLE></VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And immediately he began to proclaim Jesus in the synagogues, saying, »He is the Son of God.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">All those who heard him were amazed, and said, »Is this not he who made havoc in Jerusalem of those who called on this name, and who had come here for the purpose of bringing them bound before the chief priests?«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">But Saul increased all the more in strength, and confounded the Jews who lived at Damascus by proving that this Jesus is the Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">When many days had passed, the Jews plotted to kill him,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">but their plot became known to Saul. They were watching the gates day and night, to kill him;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">but his disciples took him by night and let him down through an opening in the wall, lowering him in a basket.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">When he came to Jerusalem, he tried to join the disciples; but they were all afraid of him, not believing that he was a disciple.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">But Barnabas took him and brought him to the apostles. And he declared to them how he had seen the Lord on the road, and that he had spoken to him, and how he had preached boldly at Damascus in the name of Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And he was with them moving about freely in Jerusalem, speaking out boldly in the name of the Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And he was talking and arguing with the Hellenistic Jews; but they were seeking to kill him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">But when the brethren learned of it, they brought him down to Caesarea and sent him off to Tarsus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">So the church throughout all Judea and Galilee and Samaria enjoyed peace and was built up; and going on in the fear of the Lord and in the comfort of the Holy Spirit, it continued to increase.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">Now as Peter went through all those regions, he came down also to the saints who lived at Lydda.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">There he found a man named Aeneas, who had been bedridden for eight years and was paralyzed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Peter said to him, »Aeneas, Jesus Christ heals you; get up and make your bed.« Immediately he got up.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">And all who lived at Lydda and Sharon saw him, and they turned to the Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">Now there was at Joppa a certain disciple named Tabitha (which is translated Dorcas). She was full of good works and acts of charity.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">And at that time she fell sick and died; and when they had washed her, they laid her body in an upper room.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">Since Lydda was near Joppa, the disciples, having heard that Peter was there, sent two men to him, imploring him, »Please come to us without delay.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">So Peter rose and went with them. And when he arrived, they took him to the upper room. All the widows stood beside him, weeping and showing the tunics and other garments that Dorcas made while she was with them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">But Peter sent them all out and knelt down and prayed; then turning to the body, he said, »Tabitha, arise.« And she opened her eyes, and when she saw Peter, she sat up.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">And he gave her his hand and raised her up. Then calling the saints and widows he presented her alive.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">It became known all over Joppa, and many believed in the Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">And Peter stayed for many days in Joppa with a tanner named Simon.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="10">
      <VERS vnumber="1">At Caesarea there was a man named Cornelius, a centurion of what was known as the Italian Cohort,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">a devout man and one who feared God with all his household, and gave alms generously to the people and prayed to God continually.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">About the ninth hour of the day he clearly saw in a vision an angel of God who had just come in and said to him, »Cornelius!«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And he stared at him in terror, and said, »What is it, Lord?« And he said to him, »Your prayers and alms have ascended as a memorial before God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Now send men to Joppa, and bring a man named Simon who is called Peter;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">he is staying with a tanner named Simon, whose house is by the sea.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">When the angel who spoke to him had left, he called two of his servants and a devout soldier of those who were his personal attendants,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">and after he had explained everything to them, he sent them to Joppa.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">The next day, as they were on their journey and approaching the city, Peter went up on the housetop about the sixth hour to pray.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And he became hungry and was desiring something to eat; but while they were preparing it, he fell into a trance</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">and he saw heaven opened, and something descending, like a great sheet, let down by four corners to the earth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">In it were all kinds of four-footed animals and reptiles of the earth and birds of the air.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">A voice came to him, »Get up, Peter. Kill and eat!«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">But Peter said, »No, Lord; for I have never eaten anything that is common or unclean.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And the voice came to him again a second time, »What God has cleansed, you must not call common.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">This happened three times, and immediately the thing was taken up to heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Now while Peter was inwardly perplexed as to what the vision which he had seen might mean, behold, the men that were sent by Cornelius, having made inquiry for Simon's house, appeared at the gate.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">They called out, asking whether Simon who was known as Peter was staying there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">While Peter was reflecting on the vision, the Spirit said to him, »Behold, three men are looking for you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">But get up, go downstairs and accompany them without hesitation, for I have sent them myself.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Peter went down to the men and said, »Behold, I am the one you are looking for; what is the reason you have come?«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">They said, »Cornelius, a centurion, a righteous and God-fearing man, who is well spoken of by the whole Jewish nation, was directed by a holy angel to send for you to come to his house, and to hear what you have to say.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">So he invited them in to be his guests. <STYLE css="display:block;text-indent:5mm">The next day he rose and went off with them, and some of the brethren from Joppa accompanied him.</STYLE></VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">On the following day he entered Caesarea. Now Cornelius was expecting them and had called together his relatives and close friends.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">When Peter entered, Cornelius met him and fell down at his feet and worshipped him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">But Peter raised him up, saying, »Stand up; I too am just a man.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">As he talked with him, he went in and found many people assembled.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And he said to them, »You yourselves know how unlawful it is for a Jew to associate with a foreigner or to visit him; but God has shown me that I should not call any man common or unclean.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">So when I was sent for, I came without raising any objection. I ask then why you sent for me.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Cornelius said, »Four days ago to this hour, I was praying in my house during the ninth hour; and behold, a man stood before me in shining garments,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">and he said, Cornelius, your prayer has been heard and your alms have been remembered before God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">Send therefore to Joppa and ask for Simon who is called Peter; he is lodging in the house of Simon, a tanner, by the sea.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">So I sent for you immediately, and you have been kind enough to come. Now therefore we are all here present in the sight of God, to hear all that you have been commanded by the Lord.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">And opening his mouth, Peter said: »I most certainly understand now that God is not one to show partiality,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">but in every nation the man who fears him and does what is right is welcome to him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">You know the word which he sent to Israel, preaching good news of peace through Jesus Christ (he is Lord of all).</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">You know what has happened throughout all Judea, beginning from Galilee after the baptism which John preached:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and with power, and how he went about doing good and healing all who were oppressed by the devil, for God was with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">We are witnesses of all that he did both in the country of the Jews and in Jerusalem. They put him to death by hanging him on a tree;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">but God raised him up on the third day and caused him to be seen,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">not to all the people but to us who were chosen by God as witnesses, who ate and drank with him after he rose from the dead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">And he commanded us to preach to the people, and to testify that he is the one appointed by God to be judge of the living and the dead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">Of him all the prophets bear witness that everyone who believes in him receives forgiveness of sins through his name.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">While Peter was still speaking these words, the Holy Spirit fell on all who heard the message.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">All the circumcised believers who came with Peter were amazed, because the gift of the Holy Spirit had been poured out even on the Gentiles.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">For they heard them speaking in tongues and praising God. Then Peter said,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">»Can anyone refuse the water for these people to be baptized who have received the Holy Spirit just as we have?«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">And he ordered them to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. Then they asked him to stay on for a few days.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="11">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now the apostles and the brethren who were throughout Judea heard that the Gentiles also had received the word of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">So when Peter went up to Jerusalem, the circumcised believers criticized him,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">saying, »You went to uncircumcised men and ate with them.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">But Peter began and explained to them in order:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">»I was in the city of Joppa praying; and in a trance I saw a vision, something descending like a great sheet, let down from heaven by four corners; and it came down to me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And when I looked into it I saw four-footed animals of the earth, wild beasts, reptiles, and birds of the air.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Then I heard a voice saying to me, Get up, Peter. Kill and eat!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">But I said, No, Lord; for nothing common or unclean has ever entered my mouth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">But the voice answered a second time from heaven, What God has cleansed you must not call common.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">This happened three times, and all was drawn up again into heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And behold, at that moment three men appeared at the house in which we were staying, having been sent to me from Caesarea.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">The Spirit told me to go with them with no hesitation. These six brethren also went with me, and we entered the man's house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And he told us how he had seen the angel standing in his house and saying, Send to Joppa and bring Simon, who is also called Peter;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">he will declare to you a message by which you will be saved, you and all your household.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">As I began to speak, the Holy Spirit fell on them just as on us at the beginning.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And I remembered the word of the Lord, how he said, John baptized with water, but you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">So if God gave them the same gift as he gave us, who believed in the Lord Jesus Christ, who was I that I could oppose God?«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">When they heard this, they quieted down and glorified God, saying, »So then, God has granted to the Gentiles also the repentance unto life.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Now those who were scattered because of the persecution that arose in connection with Stephen traveled as far as Phoenicia and Cyprus and Antioch, speaking the word to no one except Jews.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">But there were some of them, men of Cyprus and Cyrene, who came to Antioch and began speaking to the Greeks also, preaching the Lord Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">The hand of the Lord was with them, and a great number believed and turned to the Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">News of this reached the ears of the church at Jerusalem, and they sent Barnabas to Antioch.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">When he arrived and saw the grace of God, he was glad and encouraged them all to remain true to the Lord with all their hearts;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">for he was a good man, full of the Holy Spirit and of faith. And a great number of people were brought to the Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">So Barnabas went to Tarsus to look for Saul;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">and when he had found him, he brought him to Antioch. So for a whole year they met with the church and taught great numbers of people; and the disciples were called Christians first in Antioch.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Now at this time some prophets came down from Jerusalem to Antioch.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">One of them named Agabus stood up and foretold by the Spirit that there would be a great famine all over the world. And this took place in the reign of Claudius.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And the disciples determined, each according to his ability, to send relief for the brethren living in Judea.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And this they did, sending it to the elders by Barnabas and Saul.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="12">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now about that time Herod the king laid hands on some who belonged to the church in order to persecute them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">He had James the brother of John put to death with the sword.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">When he saw that it pleased the Jews, he proceeded to arrest Peter also. This was during the days of Unleavened Bread.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">When he had seized him, he put him in prison, and delivered him to four squads of soldiers to guard him, intending after the Passover to bring him out to the people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">So Peter was kept in prison, but earnest prayer for him was made to God by the church.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">The very night when Herod was about to bring him out, Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two chains, and sentries before the door were guarding the prison.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And behold, an angel of the Lord suddenly appeared, and a light shone in the cell; and he struck Peter's side and woke him up, saying, »Get up quickly.« And the chains fell off his hands.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And the angel said to him, »Dress yourself and put on your sandals.« And he did so. And he said to him, »Wrap your cloak around you and follow me.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">So he went out and followed him; and he did not know that what was done by the angel was real, but thought he was seeing a vision.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">When they had passed the first and the second guard, they came to the iron gate leading into the city. It opened for them by itself, and they went out and passed on through one street; and immediately the angel left him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">When Peter came to himself, he said, »Now I know for sure that the Lord has sent his angel and rescued me from the hand of Herod and from all that the Jewish people were expecting.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">When he realized this, he went to the house of Mary, the mother of John who was also called Mark, where many were gathered together and were praying.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And when he knocked at the door of the gate, a servant-girl named Rhoda came to answer.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">When she recognized Peter's voice, in her joy she did not open the gate, but ran in and announced that Peter was standing in front of the gate.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="5">When an attempt was made by both the Gentiles and the Jews with their rulers, to mistreat them and to stone them,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">they became aware of it and fled to the cities of Lycaonia, Lystra and Derbe, and to the surrounding country;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">and there they continued to preach the gospel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">At Lystra there was a man sitting who had no strength in his feet, lame from birth, who had never walked.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">He listened to Paul speaking; and Paul, looking intently at him and seeing that he had faith to be made well,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="11">And when the crowds saw what Paul had done, they lifted up their voices, saying in the Lycaonian language, »The gods have come down to us in the likeness of men!«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Barnabas they called Zeus, and Paul, because he was the chief speaker, they called Hermes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">The priest of Zeus, whose temple was just outside the city, brought oxen and garlands to the gates, and wanted to offer sacrifice with the crowds.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">But when the apostles Barnabas and Paul heard of it, they tore their robes and rushed out into the crowd, crying out</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">»Men, why are you doing this? We also are men, of like nature with you, and bring you good news, that you should turn from these vain things to a living God who made the heaven and the earth and the sea and all that is in them.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="23">And when they had appointed elders for them in every church, with prayer and fasting they committed them to the Lord in whom they believed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">They passed through Pisidia, and came into Pamphylia.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And when they had spoken the word in Perga, they went down to Attalia.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">From there they sailed to Antioch, where they had been commended to the grace of God for the work which they had completed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">When they arrived, they gathered the church together and declared all that God had done with them, and how he had opened a door of faith to the Gentiles.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">So, being sent on their way by the church, they passed through both Phoenicia and Samaria, reporting the conversion of the Gentiles, and they gave great joy to all the brethren.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">When they came to Jerusalem, they were welcomed by the church and the apostles and the elders, and they reported all that God had done with them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">But some believers who belonged to the party of the Pharisees stood up, and said, »It is necessary to circumcise them, and to charge them to keep the Law of Moses.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">The apostles and the elders came together to consider this matter.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">After there had been much debate, Peter stood up and said to them, »Brethren, you know that in the early days God made a choice among you, that by my mouth the Gentiles would hear the word of the gospel and believe.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="11">But we believe that we are saved through the grace of the Lord Jesus, just as they are.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">All the assembly kept silent; and they listened to Barnabas and Paul as they related what signs and wonders God had done through them among the Gentiles.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">After they finished speaking, James replied, »Brethren, listen to me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Simeon has related how God first showed his concern by taking from the Gentiles a people for his name.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="21">For Moses from ancient generations has in every city those who preach him, since he is read in the synagogues every Sabbath.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Then it seemed good to the apostles and the elders, with the whole church, to choose men from among them and send them to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas. They sent Judas called Barsabbas, and Silas, leading men among the brethren,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">and they sent the following letter with them: »The apostles and the brethren who are elders, to the brethren in Antioch and Syria and Cilicia who are from the Gentiles, greetings.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Since we have heard that some persons from us have disturbed you with words, unsettling your minds, although we gave them no instructions,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">it has seemed good to us, having come to one accord, to choose men and send them to you with our beloved Barnabas and Paul,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">men who have risked their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">We have therefore sent Judas and Silas, who themselves will tell you the same things by word of mouth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">For it seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to us to lay upon you no greater burden than these essentials:</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="30">So when they were sent off, they went down to Antioch; and having gathered the congregation together, they delivered the letter.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="39">There arose such a sharp disagreement that they separated from one another, and Barnabas took Mark with him and sailed away to Cyprus.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">Paul wanted this man to accompany him; and he took him and circumcised him because of the Jews who were in those places, for they all knew that his father was a Greek.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">As they went on their way through the cities, they delivered to them for observance the decisions which had been reached by the apostles and elders who were in Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">So the churches were strengthened in the faith, and increased in numbers daily.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And they went through the region of Phrygia and Galatia, having been forbidden by the Holy Spirit to speak the word in Asia.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And when they came to Mysia, they tried to go into Bithynia, but the Spirit of Jesus did not allow them;</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="11">So putting out to sea from Troas, we ran a straight course to Samothrace, and on the day following to Neapolis;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">and from there to Philippi, which is the leading city of the district of Macedonia, and a Roman colony. We stayed in this city some days;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">and on the Sabbath day we went outside the gate to the riverside, where we supposed there was a place of prayer; and we sat down and began speaking to the women who had come together.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">A woman named Lydia, from the city of Thyatira, a seller of purple fabrics, who was a worshiper of God, was listening. The Lord opened her heart to respond to the things spoken by Paul.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">When she and her household had been baptized, she urged us, saying, »If you have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, come into my house and stay.« And she prevailed upon us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">It happened that as we were going to the place of prayer, we were met by a slave-girl who had a spirit of divination. She brought her owners much profit by fortune-telling.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">She followed Paul and the rest of us, crying, »These men are servants of the Most High God, who are telling you the way of salvation.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">She continued doing this for many days. But Paul was greatly annoyed, and turned and said to the spirit, »I command you in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her!« And it came out at that very moment.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">But when her owners saw that their hope of profit was gone, they seized Paul and Silas and dragged them into the marketplace before the authorities,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">and when they had brought them to the magistrates they said, »These men are Jews and they are throwing our city into an uproar.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">They advocate customs which it is not lawful for us Romans to accept or practice.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">The crowd joined against them, and the magistrates tore the garments off them and ordered them to be beaten with rods.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And when they had inflicted many blows upon them, they threw them into prison, charging the jailer to guard them securely.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Having received such a charge, he put them into the inner prison and fastened their feet in the stocks.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">But about midnight Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns to God, and the prisoners were listening to them,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">and suddenly there came a great earthquake, so that the foundations of the prison were shaken; and immediately all the doors were opened and everyone's chains were unfastened.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">When the jailer woke and saw that the prison doors were open, he drew his sword and was about to kill himself, supposing that the prisoners had escaped.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">But Paul cried with a loud voice, »Do not harm yourself, for we are all here!«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And he called for lights and rushed in, and trembling with fear he fell down before Paul and Silas.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">He brought them out and said, »Sirs, what must I do to be saved?«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">They said, »Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved, you and your household.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">They spoke the word of the Lord to him and to all who were in his house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">He took them that very hour of the night and washed their wounds, and immediately he was baptized, he and all his family.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Then he brought them up into his house, and set food before them; and he rejoiced with his whole household that he had believed in God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">But when it was day, the magistrates sent their police, saying, »Release those men.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">And the jailer reported these words to Paul, saying, »The chief magistrates have sent to release you. Therefore come out now and go in peace.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">But Paul said to them, »They have beaten us publicly, without trial, men who are Roman citizens, and have thrown us into prison; and do they now cast us out secretly? No! Let them come themselves and take us out.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">The police reported these words to the magistrates, and they were afraid when they heard that they were Roman citizens.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">So they came and apologized to them, and they took them out and asked them to leave the city.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="2">And Paul went in, as was his custom, and for three weeks he reasoned with them from the scriptures,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">explaining and proving that the Christ had to suffer and rise again from the dead, and saying, »This Jesus whom I am proclaiming to you is the Christ.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And some of them were persuaded, and joined Paul and Silas; as did a large number of the God-fearing Greeks and not a few of the leading women.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">But the Jews were jealous, and taking some wicked men from the market place, they formed a mob and set the city in an uproar; they attacked the house of Jason, seeking to bring them out to the people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">When they did not find them, they dragged Jason and some of the brethren before the city authorities, shouting, »These men who have turned the world upside down have come here also,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">and Jason has welcomed them, and they are all acting against the decrees of Caesar, saying that there is another king, Jesus.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">The crowd and the city authorities were disturbed when they heard this.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And when they had taken a pledge from Jason and the others, they let them go.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">The brethren immediately sent Paul and Silas away by night to Berea, and when they arrived, they went into the Jewish synagogue.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Now these were more noble-minded than those in Thessalonica, for they received the word with great eagerness, examining the Scriptures daily to see if these things were so.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Therefore many of them believed, along with a number of prominent Greek women and men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">But when the Jews of Thessalonica learned that the word of God was proclaimed by Paul in Berea also, they came there too, agitating and stirring up the crowds.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Then the brethren immediately sent Paul out to go as far as the sea, but Silas and Timothy remained there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Now those who escorted Paul brought him as far as Athens; and receiving a command for Silas and Timothy to come to him as soon as possible, they left.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Now while Paul was waiting for them at Athens, his spirit was provoked within him as he saw that the city was full of idols.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">So he was reasoning in the synagogue with the Jews and the God-fearing Greeks, and in the market place every day with those who happened to be there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And also some of the Epicurean and Stoic philosophers were conversing with him. Some said, »What would this idle babbler wish to say?« Others, »He seems to be a proclaimer of foreign deities,«because he was preaching Jesus and the resurrection.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And they took hold of him and brought him to the Areopagus, saying, »May we know what this new teaching is which you present?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">For you are bringing some strange things to our ears; so we want to know what these things mean.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">(Now all the Athenians and the foreigners who lived there spent their time in nothing other than telling or hearing something new.)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">So Paul stood up in the meeting of the Areopagus and said: »Men of Athens, I see that in every way you are very religious.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">For as I passed along, and observed the objects of your worship, I found also an altar with this inscription, <STYLE css="display:block;text-align:center">TO AN UNKNOWN GOD.</STYLE> What therefore you worship as unknown, this I proclaim to you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">The God who made the world and everything in it, since he is Lord of heaven and earth, does not live in temples made by hands;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">nor is he served by human hands, as though he needed anything, since he himself gives to all men life and breath and everything.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And he made from one man every nation of men to live on all the face of the earth, having determined their appointed times and the boundaries of their habitation,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">that they would seek God, if perhaps they might grope for him and find him, though he is not far from each one of us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">
        <STYLE css="display:block;text-indent:5mm">For in him we live and move and have our being,</STYLE> as even some of your own poets have said, <STYLE css="display:block;text-indent:5mm">We are his offspring.</STYLE></VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Being then God's offspring, we ought not to think that the Divine Nature is like gold or silver or stone, an image formed by the art and imagination of man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">The times of ignorance God overlooked, but now he commands all people everywhere to repent,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">because he has fixed a day on which he will judge the world in righteousness by a man whom he has appointed, and of this he has given proof to all men by raising him from the dead.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">Now when they heard about the resurrection of the dead, some of them sneered, but others said, »We want to hear you again on this subject.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">So Paul went out from among them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">But some men joined him and believed, among whom also were Dionysius the Areopagite and a woman named Damaris and others with them.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="18">
      <VERS vnumber="1">After this he left Athens and went to Corinth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And he found a Jew named Aquila, a native of Pontus, having recently come from Italy with his wife Priscilla, because Claudius had commanded all the Jews to leave Rome. He went to see them,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">and because he was of the same trade he stayed with them, and they worked, for by trade they were tentmakers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And every Sabbath he was reasoning in the synagogue, and trying to persuade Jews and Greeks.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">When Silas and Timothy came from Macedonia, Paul devoted himself exclusively to preaching, testifying to the Jews that Jesus was the Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But when they opposed him and blasphemed, he shook out his garments and said to them, »Your blood be on your own heads! I am clean. From now on I will go to the Gentiles.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Then he left there and went to the house of a man named Titius Justus, a worshiper of God, whose house was next door to the synagogue.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Crispus, the ruler of the synagogue, believed in the Lord, together with all his household; and many of the Corinthians who heard him believed and were baptized.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And the Lord said to Paul one night in a vision, »Do not be afraid, but go on speaking and do not be silent;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">for I am with you, and no man will attack you to harm you, for I have many people in this city.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And he stayed a year and six months, teaching the word of God among them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">But while Gallio was proconsul of Achaia, the Jews made a united attack upon Paul and brought him before the judgment seat,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">saying, »This man is persuading men to worship God contrary to the law.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">But when Paul was about to open his mouth, Gallio said to the Jews, »If it were a matter of wrong or of vicious crime, O Jews, it would be reasonable for me to put up with you;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">but since it is a matter of questions about words and names and your own law, see to it yourselves; I refuse to be a judge of these things.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And he drove them from the judgment seat.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And they all seized Sosthenes, the ruler of the synagogue, and beat him in front of the judgment seat. But Gallio paid no attention to this.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">After this Paul stayed many days longer, and then took leave of the brethren and sailed for Syria, and with him were Priscilla and Aquila. In Cenchrea he had his hair cut, for he had taken a vow.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">They came to Ephesus, and he left them there. Now he himself went into the synagogue and reasoned with the Jews.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">When they asked him to stay for a longer time, he declined;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">but on taking leave of them he said, »I will return to you if God wills,« and he set sail from Ephesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">When he had landed at Caesarea, he went up and greeted the church, and then went down to Antioch.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">After spending some time there, he departed and went from place to place through the region of Galatia and Phrygia, strengthening all the disciples.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Now a Jew named Apollos, a native of Alexandria, came to Ephesus. He was an eloquent man, well versed in the scriptures.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">He had been instructed in the way of the Lord; and being fervent in spirit, he spoke and taught accurately the things concerning Jesus, though he knew only the baptism of John.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And he began to speak out boldly in the synagogue. But when Priscilla and Aquila heard him, they took him aside and explained to him the way of God more accurately.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And when he wanted to go across to Achaia, the brethren encouraged him and wrote to the disciples to welcome him. When he had arrived, he greatly helped those who had believed through grace,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">for he powerfully refuted the Jews in public, proving by the Scriptures that Jesus was the Christ.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="19">
      <VERS vnumber="1">While Apollos was at Corinth, Paul passed through the upper country and came to Ephesus. There he found some disciples.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And he said to them, »Did you receive the Holy Spirit when you believed?« And they said, »No, we have not even heard that there is a Holy Spirit.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And he said, »Into what then were you baptized?« They said, »Into John's baptism.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Paul said, »John baptized with the baptism of repentance, telling the people to believe in the one who was coming after him, that is, in Jesus.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">On hearing this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And when Paul had laid his hands upon them, the Holy Spirit came on them, and they spoke with tongues and prophesied.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">There were about twelve men in all.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And he entered the synagogue and for three months spoke boldly, arguing and persuading about the kingdom of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">But when some were stubborn and disbelieved, speaking evil of the Way before the congregation, he withdrew from them, and took the disciples with him, reasoning daily in the hall of Tyrannus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">This took place for two years, so that all who lived in the province of Asia heard the word of the Lord, both Jews and Greeks.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">God did extraordinary miracles by the hands of Paul,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">so that handkerchiefs or aprons were even carried from his body to the sick, and diseases left them and the evil spirits went out.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">But also some of the Jewish exorcists, who went from place to place, attempted to name over those who had the evil spirits the name of the Lord Jesus, saying, »I adjure you by Jesus whom Paul preaches.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Seven sons of Sceva, a Jewish chief priest, were doing this.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">But the evil spirit answered them, »Jesus I know, and I know about Paul, but who are you?«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And the man in whom the evil spirit was leaped on them, overpowered all of them, and prevailed against them, so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">This became known to all, both Jews and Greeks, who lived in Ephesus; and fear fell upon them all and the name of the Lord Jesus was being magnified.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Many also of those who believed now came, confessing and disclosing their practices.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And a number of those who practiced magic arts brought their books together and burned them in the sight of all; and they counted the value of them and found it came to fifty thousand pieces of silver.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">So the word of the Lord grew mightily and prevailed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Now after these things were finished, Paul purposed in the spirit to go to Jerusalem after he had passed through Macedonia and Achaia, saying, »After I have been there, I must also see Rome.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And having sent into Macedonia two of his helpers, Timothy and Erastus, he himself stayed in Asia for a while.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">About that time there arose no small disturbance concerning the Way.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">For a man named Demetrius, a silversmith, who made silver shrines of Artemis, brought no little business to the craftsmen.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">These he gathered together, with the workmen of similar trades, and said, »Men, you know that from this business we have our wealth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And you see and hear that not only in Ephesus, but in almost all of Asia, this Paul has persuaded and turned away a considerable number of people, saying that gods made with hands are no gods at all.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Not only is there danger that this trade of ours fall into disrepute, but also that the temple of the great goddess Artemis be regarded as worthless and that she whom all of Asia and the world worship will even be dethroned from her magnificence.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">When they heard this, they were enraged and began crying out, »Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">The city was filled with the confusion, and they rushed with one accord into the theater, dragging along Gaius and Aristarchus, Paul's traveling companions from Macedonia.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Paul wanted to go in among the crowd, but the disciples would not let him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Some of the Asiarchs also, who were friends of his, sent to him and begged him not to venture into the theater.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">Now some were shouting one thing, some another; for the assembly was in confusion, and most of the people did not know why they had come together.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">Some of the crowd prompted Alexander, since the Jews had put him forward. And Alexander motioned with his hand, wishing to make a defense to the people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">But when they recognized that he was a Jew, for about two hours they all with one voice shouted, »Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">And when the town clerk had quieted the crowd, he said, »Men of Ephesus, what man is there after all who does not know that the city of the Ephesians is guardian of the temple of the great Artemis and of the image which fell down from heaven?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">Therefore, since these facts are undeniable, you ought to be quiet and do nothing rash.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">For you have brought these men here who are neither robbers of temples nor blasphemers of our goddess.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">If then Demetrius and the craftsmen with him have a complaint against anyone, the courts are open, and there are proconsuls; let them bring charges against one another.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">But if you want anything further, it shall be settled in the lawful assembly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">As it is, we are in danger of being charged with rioting because of today's events. In that case we would not be able to account for this commotion, since there is no reason for it.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">After he had said this, he dismissed the assembly.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="20">
      <VERS vnumber="1">After the uproar had ceased, Paul sent for the disciples, and when he had exhorted them and taken his leave of them, he set out for Macedonia.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">When he had gone through those parts and had given them much encouragement, he came to Greece.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">There he spent three months, and when a plot was made against him by the Jews as he was about to set sail for Syria, he decided to return through Macedonia.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">He was accompanied by Sopater of Berea, the son of Pyrrhus, and by Aristarchus and Secundus of the Thessalonians, and Gaius of Derbe, and Timothy, and Tychicus and Trophimus of Asia.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">These went on ahead and were waiting for us at Troas.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But we sailed away from Philippi after the Days of Unleavened Bread, and in five days came to them at Troas, where we stayed seven days.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">On the first day of the week, when we were gathered together to break bread, Paul began talking to them, intending to leave the next day, and he prolonged his message until midnight.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">There were many lamps in the upper room where we were gathered.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And there was a young man named Eutychus sitting in the window sill, sinking into a deep sleep. And as Paul talked on and on, he was overcome by sleep and fell down from the third story and was picked up dead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">But Paul went down and fell on him, and after embracing him, he said, »Do not be alarmed, for his life is in him.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">When he had gone back up and had broken the bread and eaten, he talked with them a long while until daybreak, and then left.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">They took away the boy alive, and were greatly comforted.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">But going ahead to the ship, we set sail for Assos, intending to take Paul aboard there; for so he had arranged, intending himself to go by land.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And when he met us at Assos, we took him on board and came to Mitylene.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Sailing from there, we arrived the following day opposite Chios; and the next day we crossed over to Samos; and the day after that we came to Miletus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">For Paul had decided to sail past Ephesus, so that he would not have to spend time in Asia; for he was hurrying to be in Jerusalem, if possible, on the day of Pentecost.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">From Miletus he sent to Ephesus and called to him the elders of the church.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And when they came to him, he said to them: »You yourselves know how I lived the whole time I was with you, from the first day that I set foot in Asia,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">serving the Lord with all humility and with tears and with trials which came upon me through the plots of the Jews;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">how I did not shrink from declaring to you anything that was profitable, and teaching you publicly and from house to house,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">testifying both to Jews and to Greeks of repentance toward God and faith in our Lord Jesus Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And now, behold, bound in the Spirit, I am going to Jerusalem, not knowing what will happen to me there,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">except that the Holy Spirit solemnly testifies to me in every city, saying that bonds and afflictions await me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">But I do not consider my life of any account nor as precious to myself, if only I may finish my course and the ministry which I received from the Lord Jesus, to testify to the gospel of the grace of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And now, behold, I know that all of you among whom I have gone about preaching the kingdom will see my face no more.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Therefore, I testify to you this day that I am innocent of the blood of all men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">For I did not shrink from declaring to you the whole counsel of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Be on guard for yourselves and for all the flock, among which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers, to shepherd the church of God which he purchased with the blood of his Own.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">I know that after my departure savage wolves will come in among you, not sparing the flock;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">and from among your own selves will arise men speaking perverse things, to draw away the disciples after them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Therefore be alert, remembering that for three years I did not cease night and day to admonish each one with tears.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">And now I commend you to God and to the word of his grace, which is able to build you up and to give you the inheritance among all those who are sanctified.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">I have coveted no one's silver or gold or clothes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">You yourselves know that these hands ministered to my own needs and to the men who were with me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">In everything I did, I showed you that by this kind of hard work we must help the weak, remembering the words the Lord Jesus himself said: It is more blessed to give than to receive.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">When he had said this, he knelt down and prayed with them all.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">And they all wept and embraced Paul and kissed him,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">grieving most of all over the word which he had spoken, that they would not see his face again. And they accompanied him to the ship.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="21">
      <VERS vnumber="1">When we had parted from them and set sail, we came by a straight course to Cos, and the next day to Rhodes, and from there to Patara.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And having found a ship crossing over to Phoenicia, we went aboard and set sail.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">When we had come in sight of Cyprus, leaving it on the left we sailed to Syria, and landed at Tyre; for there the ship was to unload its cargo.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And having sought out the disciples, we stayed there for seven days. Through the Spirit they told Paul not to go on to Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And when our days there were ended, we left and started on our journey, while they all, with wives and children, brought us on our way until we were out of the city. After kneeling down on the beach and praying, we said farewell to one another.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Then we went on board the ship, and they returned home.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">When we had finished the voyage from Tyre, we arrived at Ptolemais; and we greeted the brethren and stayed with them for a day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">On the next day we left and came to Caesarea, and entering the house of Philip the evangelist, who was one of the seven, we stayed with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">He had four unmarried daughters who prophesied.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">As we were staying there for some days, a prophet named Agabus came down from Judea.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And coming to us, he took Paul's belt and bound his own feet and hands, and said, »This is what the Holy Spirit says, In this way the Jews at Jerusalem will bind the man who owns this belt and deliver him into the hands of the Gentiles.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">When we heard this, we and the people there begged him not to go up to Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Then Paul answered, »What are you doing, weeping and breaking my heart? For I am ready not only to be bound but even to die at Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And when he would not be persuaded, we ceased and said, »The will of the Lord be done.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">After these days we got ready and went up to Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And some of the disciples from Caesarea went with us, bringing us to the house of Mnason of Cyprus, an early disciple, with whom we were to lodge.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">When we arrived at Jerusalem, the brethren received us gladly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And the following day Paul went in with us to James, and all the elders were present.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">After he had greeted them, he related one by one the things that God had done among the Gentiles through his ministry.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And when they heard it, they glorified God. And they said to him, »You see, brother, how many thousands there are among the Jews of those who have believed; they are all zealous for the law,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">and they have been told about you that you teach all the Jews who are among the Gentiles to forsake Moses, telling them not to circumcise their children or to walk according to the customs.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">What then is to be done? They will certainly hear that you have come.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Therefore do what we tell you. We have four men who are under a vow;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">take these men and purify yourself along with them and pay their expenses, so that they may shave their heads. Thus all will know that there is nothing in what they have been told about you, but that you yourself live in observance of the law.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">But as for the Gentiles who have believed, we wrote to them our decision that they should abstain from meat sacrificed to idols and from blood and from what is strangled and from fornication.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">The next day Paul took the men and purified himself along with them. Then he went to the temple to give notice of the date when the days of purification would end and the offering would be made for each one of them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">When the seven days were almost over, the Jews from Asia, upon seeing him in the temple, stirred up all the crowd and laid hands on him,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">crying out, »Men of Israel, help! This is the man who is teaching all men everywhere against our people and our law and this place; and besides he also brought Greeks into the temple, and he has defiled this holy place.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">For they had previously seen Trophimus the Ephesian in the city with him, and they supposed that Paul had brought him into the temple.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Then all the city was aroused, and the people rushed together, and taking hold of Paul they dragged him out of the temple, and immediately the gates were shut.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">While they were trying to kill him, a report came up to the commander of the Roman cohort that all Jerusalem was in confusion.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">At once he took along some soldiers and centurions and ran down to them; and when they saw the commander and the soldiers, they stopped beating Paul.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">Then the commander came up and arrested him, and ordered him to be bound with two chains. He inquired who he was and what he had done.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Some in the crowd shouted one thing, and some another; and as he could not learn the facts because of the uproar, he ordered him to be brought into the barracks.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">When he came to the steps, he was actually carried by the soldiers because of the violence of the mob;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">for the mob of the people followed, shouting, »Away with him!«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">As Paul was about to be brought into the barracks, he said to the commander, »May I say something to you?« And he said, »Do you know Greek?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">Then you are not the Egyptian who some time ago stirred up a revolt and led the four thousand men of the Assassins out into the wilderness?«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">Paul replied, »I am a Jew, from Tarsus in Cilicia, a citizen of no insignificant city; I beg you, let me speak to the people.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">When he had given him permission, Paul, standing on the steps, motioned to the people with his hand; and when there was a great hush, he spoke to them in the Hebrew language, saying,</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="22">
      <VERS vnumber="1">»Brethren and fathers, hear my defense which I now offer to you.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And when they heard that he addressed them in the Hebrew language, they became more quiet. And he said:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">»I am a Jew, born in Tarsus of Cilicia, but brought up in this city, educated under Gamaliel, strictly according to the law of our fathers, being zealous for God just as you all are today.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">I persecuted this Way to the death, binding and delivering into prison both men and women,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">as also the high priest and all the Council of the elders can testify. From them I also received letters to the brethren, and started off for Damascus in order to bring even those who were there to Jerusalem as prisoners to be punished.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">»As I made my journey and drew near to Damascus, about noon a bright light from heaven suddenly flashed around me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And I fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to me, Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And I answered, Who are you, Lord? And he said to me, I am Jesus of Nazareth, whom you are persecuting.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And those who were with me saw the light, but did not hear the voice of the one who was speaking to me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And I said, What shall I do, Lord? And the Lord said to me, Get up and go on into Damascus, and there you will be told of all that has been appointed for you to do.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">But since I could not see because of the brightness of that light, I was led by the hand by those who were with me and came into Damascus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">»A certain Ananias, a devout man according to the Law, and well spoken of by all the Jews who lived there,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">came to me, and standing near said to me, Brother Saul, receive your sight! And at that very time I looked up at him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Then he said, The God of our fathers has appointed you to know his will and to see the Righteous One and to hear words from his mouth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">For you will be a witness for him to all men of what you have seen and heard.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Now why do you delay? Get up and be baptized, and wash away your sins, calling on his name.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">»When I had returned to Jerusalem and was praying in the temple, I fell into a trance</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">and saw him saying to me, Make haste, and get out of Jerusalem quickly, because they will not accept your testimony about me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And I said, Lord, they themselves know that in one synagogue after another I used to imprison and beat those who believed in you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">When the blood of Stephen your witness was shed, I also was standing by and approving, and keeping the garments of those who were killing him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And he said to me, Go; for I will send you far away to the Gentiles.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Up to this word they listened to him, and then they raised their voices and said, »Away with such a fellow from the earth! For he ought not to live.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And as they were crying out and throwing off their cloaks and tossing dust into the air,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">the commander ordered him to be brought into the barracks, and commanded him to be examined by scourging so that he might find out the reason why they were shouting against him that way.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">But when they stretched him out with thongs, Paul said to the centurion who was standing by, »Is it lawful for you to scourge a man who is a Roman citizen and uncondemned?«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">When the centurion heard this, he went to the commander and told him, saying, »What are you about to do? For this man is a Roman citizen.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">So the commander came and said to him, »Tell me, are you a Roman citizen?« And he said, »Yes.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">The commander answered, »I bought this citizenship for a large sum.« Paul said, »But I was born a citizen.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">So those who were about to examine him withdrew from him immediately; and the commander also was afraid when he realized that Paul was a Roman citizen and that he had put him in chains.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">But on the next day, wishing to know for certain why he had been accused by the Jews, he released him and ordered the chief priests and all the Council to assemble, and brought Paul down and set him before them.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="23">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And Paul, looking intently at the council, said, »Brethren, I have lived my life before God in all good conscience up to this day.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">The high priest Ananias commanded those standing beside him to strike him on the mouth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Then Paul said to him, »God shall strike you, you whitewashed wall! Do you sit to judge me according to the law, and yet contrary to the law you order me to be struck?«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Those who stood by said, »Would you revile God's high priest?«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And Paul said, »I did not know, brethren, that he was the high priest; for it is written, You shall not speak evil of a ruler of your people.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But when Paul perceived that one part were Sadducees and the other Pharisees, he cried out in the council, »Brethren, I am a Pharisee, a son of Pharisees; with respect to the hope and the resurrection of the dead I am on trial.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">When he said this, a dissension broke out between the Pharisees and the Sadducees, and the assembly was divided.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">For the Sadducees say that there is no resurrection, nor an angel, nor a spirit, but the Pharisees acknowledge them all.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">There occurred a great uproar; and some of the scribes of the Pharisees' party stood up and began to argue heatedly, saying, »We find nothing wrong with this man. What if a spirit or an angel has spoken to him?«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">The dispute became so violent that the commander was afraid Paul would be torn to pieces by them and ordered the troops to go down and take him away from them by force, and bring him into the barracks.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">The following night the Lord stood by him and said, »Take courage, for as you have testified about me at Jerusalem, so you must bear witness also at Rome.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">When it was day, the Jews formed a conspiracy and bound themselves by an oath neither to eat nor drink until they had killed Paul.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">There were more than forty who formed this plot.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">They went to the chief priests and the elders and said, »We have bound ourselves under a solemn oath to taste nothing until we have killed Paul.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">You therefore, along with the council, give notice now to the commander to bring him down to you, as though you were going to determine his case more exactly. And we are ready to kill him before he comes near.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">But the son of Paul's sister heard of their ambush, and he went and entered the barracks and told Paul.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Paul called one of the centurions and said, »Take this young man to the commander; for he has something to tell him.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">So he took him and brought him to the commander and said, »Paul the prisoner called me and asked me to bring this young man to you, since he has something to tell you.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">The commander took him by the hand, and going aside asked him privately, »What is it that you have to tell me?«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And he said, »The Jews have agreed to ask you to bring Paul down tomorrow to the Council, as though they were going to inquire somewhat more thoroughly about him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">But do not yield to them; for more than forty of them are waiting in ambush for him, having bound themselves by an oath neither to eat nor drink until they have killed him; and now they are ready, waiting for the promise from you.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">So the commander dismissed the young man, instructing him, »Tell no one that you have informed me of this.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Then he called two of the centurions and said, »At the third hour of the night get ready two hundred soldiers with seventy horsemen and two hundred spearmen to go as far as Caesarea.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Also provide mounts for Paul to ride, and bring him safely to Felix the governor.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And he wrote a letter having this form:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">»Claudius Lysias, to His Excellency, Governor Felix: greetings.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">This man was seized by the Jews, and was about to be killed by them, when I came upon them with the troops and rescued him, having learned that he was a Roman citizen.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And desiring to know the charge for which they were accusing him, I brought him down to their council.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">I found that he was accused over questions about their Law, but there was no accusation against him deserving death or imprisonment.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And when I was informed that there would be a plot against the man, I sent him to you at once, also instructing his accusers to bring charges against him before you.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">So the soldiers, in accordance with their orders, took Paul and brought him by night to Antipatris.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">But the next day, leaving the horsemen to go on with him, they returned to the barracks.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">When these had come to Caesarea and delivered the letter to the governor, they also presented Paul to him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">When he had read the letter, he asked from what province he was, and when he learned that he was from Cilicia,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">he said, »I will hear you when your accusers arrive also.« And he commanded him to be kept in Herod's Praetorium.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="24">
      <VERS vnumber="1">After five days the high priest Ananias came down with some elders, with an attorney named Tertullus, and they brought their charges against Paul before the governor.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And when Paul was called, Tertullus began to accuse him, saying to Felix: »Since through you we have enjoyed much peace, and since by your provision, reforms are introduced on behalf of this nation,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">we acknowledge this in every way and everywhere, most excellent Felix, with all gratitude.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">But, that I may not weary you further, I beg you in your kindness to hear us briefly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">For we have found this man a pestilent fellow who stirs up dissension among all the Jews throughout the world, and a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">He even tried to desecrate the temple; so we seized him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">
      </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">By examining him yourself you will be able to learn the truth about all these charges of which we accuse him.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">The Jews also joined in the attack, asserting that these things were so.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">When the governor had motioned for him to speak, Paul replied: »Realizing that for many years you have been a judge over this nation, I cheerfully make my defense.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Since you can easily verify that no more than twelve days ago I went up to Jerusalem to worship.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">They did not find me disputing with anyone or stirring up a crowd, either in the temple or in the synagogues, or in the city.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Neither can they prove to you the charges they are now making against me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">But this I admit to you, that according to the Way which they call a sect I do worship the God of our fathers, believing everything that is in accordance with the Law and that is written in the Prophets,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">having a hope in God, which these men cherish themselves, that there will certainly be a resurrection of both the righteous and the wicked.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And so I do my best always to have a clear conscience before God and men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Now after several years I came to bring alms to my nation and to present offerings.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">As I was doing this, they found me purified in the temple, without any crowd or uproar. But there were some Jews from Asia</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">who ought to be here before you and to make accusation, if they should have anything against me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Or else let these men themselves tell what wrongdoing they found when I stood before the Council,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">except this one thing which I shouted out while standing among them, With respect to the resurrection of the dead I am on trial before you today.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">But Felix, having a more exact knowledge about the Way, put them off, saying, »When Lysias the commander comes down, I will decide your case.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Then he gave orders to the centurion for him to be kept in custody but have some freedom, and not to prevent any of his friends from ministering to his needs.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">But some days later Felix came with Drusilla, his wife who was a Jewess, and sent for Paul and heard him speak about faith in Christ Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">But as he was discussing righteousness, self-control and the judgment to come, Felix became frightened and said, »Go away for the present, and when I find time I will summon you.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">At the same time, he was hoping that money would be given him by Paul. So he sent for him often and conversed with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">But when two years had passed, Felix was succeeded by Porcius Festus, and desiring to do the Jews a favor, Felix left Paul in prison.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="25">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Festus then, three days after arriving in the province, went up to Jerusalem from Caesarea.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And the chief priests and the principal men of the Jews brought charges against Paul; and they urged him,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">as a favor to them, to have Paul transferred to Jerusalem, for they were preparing an ambush to kill him along the way.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Festus answered that Paul was being kept at Caesarea, and that he himself intended to go there shortly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">»Therefore,« he said, »let the men of authority among you go there with me, and if there is anything wrong about the man, let them prosecute him.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">After he had spent not more than eight or ten days among them, he went down to Caesarea, and on the next day he took his seat on the tribunal and ordered Paul to be brought.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And when Paul arrived, the Jews who had come down from Jerusalem stood around him, bringing many serious charges against him, which they could not prove.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Paul said in his defense, »Neither against the law of the Jews, nor against the temple, nor against Caesar have I offended at all.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">But Festus, wishing to do the Jews a favor, said to Paul, »Are you willing to go up to Jerusalem and stand trial before me there on these charges?«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">But Paul said, »I am standing before Caesar's tribunal, where I ought to be tried. I have done no wrong to the Jews, as you also very well know.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">If, then, I am a wrongdoer and have committed anything worthy of death, I do not refuse to die; but if none of the charges brought against me is true, no one can hand me over to them. I appeal to Caesar.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Then when Festus had conferred with his council, he answered, »You have appealed to Caesar, to Caesar you shall go.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Now when a few days had passed, King Agrippa and Bernice arrived at Caesarea and paid their respects to Festus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">While they were spending many days there, Festus laid Paul's case before the king, saying, »There is a man who was left as a prisoner by Felix;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">and when I was at Jerusalem, the chief priests and the elders of the Jews brought charges against him, asking for sentence against him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">I answered them that it is not the custom of the Romans to hand over any man before the accused meets his accusers face to face and has an opportunity to make his defense against the charges.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">When therefore they came together here, I did not delay, but on the next day took my seat on the tribunal and ordered the man to be brought in.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">When the accusers stood up, they did not charge him of such crimes as I had expected,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">but they simply had some points of dispute with him about their own religion and about a dead man, Jesus, whom Paul asserted to be alive.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Being at a loss how to investigate such matters, I asked whether he was willing to go to Jerusalem and there stand trial on these matters.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">But when Paul appealed to be held in custody for the Emperor's decision, I ordered him to be kept in custody until I could send him to Caesar.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Then Agrippa said to Festus, »I also would like to hear the man myself.« »Tomorrow,« he said, »you shall hear him.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">So on the next day Agrippa and Bernice came with great pomp and entered the audience room with the high ranking officers and the prominent men of the city. At the command of Festus, Paul was brought in.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Festus said, »King Agrippa and all who are present with us, you see this man about whom the whole Jewish people petitioned me, both at Jerusalem and here, shouting that he ought not to live any longer.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">But I found that he had done nothing deserving of death; and as he himself appealed to the emperor, I decided to send him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">But I have nothing definite about him to write to my lord. Therefore I have brought him before you all and especially before you, King Agrippa, so that after the investigation has taken place, I may have something to write.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">For it seems to me unreasonable, in sending a prisoner, not to indicate the charges against him.«</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="26">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Agrippa said to Paul, »You have permission to speak for yourself.« Then Paul stretched out his hand and began his defense:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">»I consider myself fortunate that it is before you, King Agrippa, I am to make my defense today against all the accusations of the Jews,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">because you are especially familiar with all customs and controversies of the Jews; therefore I beg you to listen to me patiently.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">So then, all the Jews know my manner of life from my youth up, which from the beginning was spent among my own nation and at Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">They have known about me for a long time, if they are willing to testify, that I lived as a Pharisee according to the strictest sect of our religion.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And now I am standing trial for the hope of the promise made by God to our fathers;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">the promise to which our twelve tribes hope to attain, as they earnestly serve God night and day. And for this hope, O King, I am being accused by Jews.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Why is it thought incredible by any of you that God raises the dead?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">I myself was convinced that I ought to do many things to oppose the name of Jesus of Nazareth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And that is just what I did in Jerusalem; I not only shut up many of the saints in prison, by authority from the chief priests, but when they were put to death I cast my vote against them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And as I punished them often in all the synagogues, I tried to force them to blaspheme; and being furiously enraged against them, I persecuted them even to foreign cities.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">»On one of these journeys I was going to Damascus with the authority and commission of the chief priests.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">At midday, O King, I saw on the way a light from heaven, brighter than the sun, shining around me and those who journeyed with me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And when we had all fallen to the ground, I heard a voice saying to me in the Hebrew language, Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me? It is hard for you to kick against the goads.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And I said, Who are you, Lord? And the Lord said, I am Jesus whom you are persecuting.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">But get up and stand on your feet; for this purpose I have appeared to you, to appoint you a minister and a witness to the things which you have seen of me, and also to the things in which I will appear to you;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">rescuing you from the Jewish people and from the Gentiles, to whom I am sending you,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">to open their eyes, so that they may turn from darkness to light and from the power of Satan to God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins and a place among those who are sanctified by faith in me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">»So, King Agrippa, I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">but declared first to those at Damascus, then at Jerusalem and throughout all the country of Judea, and also to the Gentiles, that they should repent and turn to God and perform deeds worthy of their repentance.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">For this reason the Jews seized me in the temple and tried to kill me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">To this day I have had the help that comes from God, and so I stand here testifying both to small and great, saying nothing but what the prophets and Moses said would happen:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">that the Christ must suffer, and that, by being the first to rise from the dead, he would proclaim light both to the people and to the Gentiles.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And as he was saying this in his defense, Festus said in a loud voice, »Paul, you are out of your mind! Your great learning is driving you mad.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">But Paul said, »I am not mad, most excellent Festus, but I am speaking the sober truth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">For the king knows about these things, and to him I speak freely; for I am persuaded that none of these things has escaped his notice, for this was not done in a corner.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">King Agrippa, do you believe the prophets? I know that you do.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And Agrippa said to Paul, »In a short time you think to persuade me to become a Christian!«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And Paul said, »Whether in a short or a long time, I would to God that not only you but also all who hear me this day might become such as I amexcept for these chains.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">The king rose and the governor and Bernice, and those who were sitting with them,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">and when they had gone aside, they began talking to one another, saying, »This man is not doing anything worthy of death or imprisonment.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">And Agrippa said to Festus, »This man could have been set free if he had not appealed to Caesar.«</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="27">
      <VERS vnumber="1">When it was decided that we would sail for Italy, they delivered Paul and some other prisoners to a centurion of the Augustan cohort named Julius.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And embarking in a ship from Adramyttium, which was about to sail to the ports along the coast of Asia, we put out to sea, accompanied by Aristarchus, a Macedonian from Thessalonica.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">The next day we put in at Sidon; and Julius treated Paul kindly, and allowed him to go to his friends and be cared for.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">We put out to sea from there and sailed under the lee of Cyprus, because the winds were against us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">When we had sailed across the open sea off the coast of Cilicia and Pamphylia, we landed at Myra in Lycia.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">There the centurion found an Alexandrian ship sailing for Italy, and he put us aboard it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">When we had sailed slowly for a good many days, and with difficulty had arrived off Cnidus, since the wind did not allow us to go farther, we sailed under the lee of Crete, off Salmone.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">We sailed along it with difficulty and came to a place called Fair Havens, near which was the city of Lasea.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">As much time had been lost, and the voyage was now dangerous because the fast had already gone by, Paul advised them,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">and said to them, »Men, I perceive that the voyage will be with injury and great loss, not only of the cargo and the ship, but also of our lives.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">But the centurion was more persuaded by the pilot and the owner of the ship than by what was being said by Paul.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Because the harbor was not suitable to winter in, the majority reached a decision to put out to sea from there, on the chance that somehow they could reach Phoenix, a harbor of Crete, facing southwest and northwest, and spend the winter there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">When a gentle south wind came up, supposing that they had obtained their purpose, they weighed anchor and began sailing along Crete, close inshore.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">But before very long there rushed down from the land a violent wind, called the northeaster;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">and when the ship was caught in it and could not face the wind, we gave way to it and were driven along.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And running under the lee of a small island called Cauda, we were scarcely able to secure the boat.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">After they had hoisted it up, they used supporting cables to undergird the ship; and fearing that they might run aground on the shallows of Syrtis, they lowered the sea anchor and in this way let themselves be driven along.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">The next day as we were being violently storm-tossed, they began to throw the cargo overboard;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">and on the third day they threw the ship's tackle overboard with their own hands.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">When neither sun nor stars appeared for many days, and no small storm was raging on us, all hope of our being saved was finally abandoned.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">When they had gone a long time without food, then Paul stood up among them and said, »Men, you should have followed my advice and not to have set sail from Crete and incurred this damage and loss.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Yet now I urge you to keep up your courage; for there will be no loss of life among you, but only of the ship.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">For this very night an angel of the God to whom I belong and whom I serve stood before me,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">and he said, Do not be afraid, Paul; you must stand before Caesar; and behold, God has granted you all those who sail with you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">So keep up your courage, men, for I have faith in God that it will happen exactly as I have been told.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">But we must run aground on some island.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">But when the fourteenth night came, as we were being driven across the Adriatic Sea, about midnight the sailors began to sense that they were approaching land.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">They took soundings and found it to be twenty fathoms; and a little farther on they took soundings again and found it to be fifteen fathoms.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Fearing that we might run aground somewhere on the rocks, they cast four anchors from the stern and prayed for daybreak.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">But as the sailors were trying to escape from the ship and had let down the lifeboat into the sea, on the pretense of laying out anchors from the bow,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Paul said to the centurion and the soldiers, »Unless these men stay in the ship, you cannot be saved.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">Then the soldiers cut the ropes of the lifeboat and let it fall away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">As day was about to dawn, Paul urged them all to take some food, saying, »Today is the fourteenth day that you have been in suspense and without food, having taken nothing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Therefore I urge you to take some food; it will give you strength, since not a hair is to perish from the head of any of you.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">Having said this, he took bread and gave thanks to God in the presence of all, and he broke it and began to eat.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">Then they all were encouraged and ate some food themselves.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">All of us in the ship were two hundred and seventy-six persons.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">When they had eaten enough, they lightened the ship by throwing out the wheat into the sea.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">When day came, they could not recognize the land, but they did observe a bay with a beach, and they resolved to drive the ship onto it if they could.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">So they cast off the anchors and left them in the sea, at the same time loosening the ropes that tied the rudders; then hoisting the foresail to the wind they made for the beach.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">But striking a sandbar they ran the vessel aground; the bow stuck fast and remained immovable, and the stern was broken up by the pounding of the surf.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">The soldiers' plan was to kill the prisoners, so that none of them would swim away and escape.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">But the centurion, wanting to bring Paul safely through, kept them from carrying out their plan. He ordered those who could swim to jump overboard first and get to land,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">and the rest on planks or on various pieces of the ship. And so it happened that they were all brought safely to land.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="28">
      <VERS vnumber="1">When we had been brought safely through, then we found out that the island was called Malta.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">The natives showed us unusual kindness, for they kindled a fire and welcomed us all, because it had begun to rain and was cold.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">But when Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks and put them on the fire, a viper came out because of the heat and fastened itself on his hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">When the natives saw the creature hanging from his hand, they said to one another, »No doubt this man is a murderer. Though he has escaped from the sea, justice has not allowed him to live.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">However he shook the creature off into the fire and suffered no harm.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">They waited, expecting him to swell up or suddenly fall down dead; but after they had waited a long time and saw nothing unusual happen to him, they changed their minds and said that he was a god.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Now in the neighborhood of that place were lands belonging to the chief man of the island, named Publius, who welcomed us and entertained us hospitably for three days.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">It happened that the father of Publius was lying in bed sick with recurrent fever and dysentery; and Paul went in to see him and after he had prayed, he laid his hands on him and healed him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">When this had happened, the rest of the people on the island who had diseases also came and were cured.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">They honored us in many ways; and when we were ready to sail, they furnished us with the supplies we needed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">After three months we set sail in a ship which had wintered in the island, an Alexandrian ship, with the Twin Brothers as figurehead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">After we put in at Syracuse, we stayed there for three days.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">From there we sailed around and arrived at Rhegium, and a day later a south wind sprang up, and on the second day we came to Puteoli.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">There we found some brethren, and were invited to stay with them for seven days. And so we came to Rome.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And the brethren, when they heard of us, came from there as far as the Forum of Appius and Three Taverns to meet us. When Paul saw them, he thanked God and took courage.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And when we came into Rome, Paul was allowed to stay by himself, with the soldier that guarded him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">After three days Paul called together the local leaders of the Jews; and when they had gathered, he said to them, »Brethren, though I had done nothing against our people or the customs of our fathers, yet I was delivered prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And when they had examined me, they were willing to release me because there was no ground for putting me to death.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">But when the Jews objected, I was compelled to appeal to Caesarnot that I had any charge to bring against my own nation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">For this reason therefore I have asked to see you and speak with you, since it is because of the hope of Israel that I am bound with this chain.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">They said to him, »We have not received letters from Judea concerning you, and none of the brethren who have come here has reported or spoken anything bad about you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">But we desire to hear from you what your views are; for concerning this sect, we know that everywhere it is spoken against.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">When they had appointed a day for Paul, they came to him at his lodging in great numbers. And he explained the matter to them from morning till evening, testifying to the kingdom of God and trying to convince them about Jesus both from the law of Moses and from the prophets.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Some were convinced by what he said, but others would not believe.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">concerning his Son, who was born of the seed of David according to the flesh,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">and declared to be the Son of God with power according to the Spirit of holiness by his resurrection from the dead, Jesus Christ our Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Through him we have received grace and apostleship to bring about the obedience of faith for the sake of his name among all the nations,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">among whom you also are called to belong to Jesus Christ;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">To all in Rome who are beloved of God, called to be saints: <STYLE css="display:block;text-indent:5mm">Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</STYLE></VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for all of you, because your faith is proclaimed in all the world.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">For God is my witness, whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel of his Son, that without ceasing I mention you always in my prayers,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">asking that somehow by God's will I may now at last find the way to come to you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">For I long to see you, so that I may impart to you some spiritual gift to strengthen you</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">that is, that you and I may be mutually encouraged by each other's faith.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">I do not want you to be unaware, brethren, that I often planned to come to you (but have been prevented from doing so until now) in order that I might have some harvest among you, just as I have had among the other Gentiles.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">I am under obligation both to Greeks and to barbarians, both to the wise and to the foolish:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">so I am eager to preach the gospel to you also who are in Rome.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">For I am not ashamed of the gospel: for it is the power of God for the salvation of everyone who believes, to the Jew first and also to the Greek.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">For in it the righteousness of God is revealed from faith to faith; as it is written, »The just shall live by faith.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and wickedness of men who by their wickedness suppress the truth,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">for what may be known about God is plain to them, because God has shown it to them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">For since the creation of the world his invisible nature, even his eternal power and deity, has been clearly seen, being understood by the things that have been made. So they are without excuse;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">for although they knew God they did not honor him as God or give thanks to him, but they became futile in their thinking, and their foolish hearts were darkened.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Claiming to be wise, they became fools,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">and exchanged the glory of the immortal God for images made like mortal man and birds and animals and reptiles.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Therefore God gave them up in the lusts of their hearts to impurity, to the dishonoring of their bodies among themselves,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">because they exchanged the truth of God for a lie and worshipped and served the creature rather than the Creator, who is blessed forever. Amen.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">For this reason God gave them up to dishonorable passions. Even their women exchanged natural relations for unnatural.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And the men likewise gave up natural relations with women and were consumed with passion for one another, men committing shameless acts with men and receiving in their own persons the due penalty for their error.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And since they did not see fit to retain the knowledge of God, God gave them over to a base mind, to do what ought not to be done.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">They were filled with all manner of wickedness, evil, covetousness, depravity. Full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, malice; they are gossips,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">slanderers, haters of God, insolent, arrogant, boastful, inventors of evil, disobedient to parents,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">foolish, faithless, heartless, ruthless.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Therefore you have no excuse, O man, whoever you are who judge another; for in whatever point you pass judgment on him you condemn yourself, because you, the judge, are doing the very same things.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">Do you think, O man, that when you judge those who do such things and yet do the same yourself, you will escape the judgment of God?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Or do you presume upon the riches of his kindness and forbearance and patience? Do you not know that God's kindness is meant to lead you to repentance?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">But by your hardness and your impenitent heart you are storing up wrath for yourself on the day of wrath when God's righteous judgment will be revealed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">For he »will render to each one according to his works«:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">to those who by patience in doing good seek for glory, honor, and immortality, he will give eternal life;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">but for those who are self-seeking and do not obey the truth, but obey wickedness, there will be wrath and fury.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">There will be tribulation and distress for every human being who does evil, the Jew first and also the Greek,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">but glory, honor, and peace for everyone who does good, the Jew first and also the Greek.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">For God shows no partiality.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">All who have sinned without the law will also perish without the law, and all who have sinned under the law will be judged by the law.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">For it is not the hearers of the law who are righteous in the sight of God, but the doers of the law who will be justified.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">When Gentiles, who have not the law, do by nature things required by the law, they are a law to themselves, even though they do not have the law.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">They show that the requirements of the law are written on their hearts, their conscience also bearing witness, and their thoughts accusing or else excusing them</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">on that day when, according to my gospel, God will judge the secrets of men by Christ Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">But if you call yourself a Jew, and rely on the law and boast of your relation to God</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">and know his will and approve of what is excellent, because you are instructed in the law,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">and if you are sure that you are a guide to the blind, a light to those who are in darkness,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">an instructor of the foolish, a teacher of infants, having in the law the embodiment of knowledge and truth</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">you, then, who teach others, do you not teach yourself? You who preach against stealing, do you steal?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">You who say that one must not commit adultery, do you commit adultery? You who abhor idols, do you rob temples?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">You who boast in the law, do you dishonor God by breaking the law?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">For, as it is written, »The name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles because of you.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Circumcision indeed is of value if you obey the law; but if you break the law, your circumcision has become uncircumcision.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">So, if a man who is uncircumcised keeps the requirements of the law, will not his uncircumcision be regarded as circumcision?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">The one who is not circumcised physically and yet obeys the law will condemn you who, even though you have the written code and circumcision, are a breaker of the law.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">For he is not a real Jew who is one outwardly, nor is true circumcision something outward and in the flesh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">He is a Jew who is one inwardly; and real circumcision is a matter of the heart, by the Spirit, and not by the written code. His praise is not from men but from God.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="3">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Then what advantage has the Jew, or what is the value of circumcision?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Much in every way! To begin with, they are entrusted with the oracles of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">What if some did not have faith? Will their faithlessness nullify the faithfulness of God?</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="7">But if through my falsehood God's truthfulness abounds to his glory, why am I still being condemned as a sinner?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Why not say  as we are being slanderously reported as saying and as some claim that we say»Let us do evil that good may come«? Their condemnation is just.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">What then? Are we Jews any better off? Certainly not; for we have already charged that all men, both Jews and Greeks, are under the power of sin.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="11">And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness which he had by faith while he was still uncircumcised, that he might be the father of all who believe but have not been circumcised, in order that righteousness might be reckoned to them.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="17">(as it is written, »I have made you the father of many nations«) in the presence of the God in whom he believed, who gives life to the dead and calls things that do not exist as though they did.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">In hope, he believed against hope, so that he became the father of many nations; as he had been told, »So shall your descendants be.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And he did not weaken in faith when he considered his own body, which was as good as dead since he was about a hundred years old, or when he considered the barrenness of Sarah's womb.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">He did not waver at the promise of God through unbelief, but was strengthened in his faith and gave glory to God,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">being fully convinced that God was able to do what he had promised.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">That is why it was »reckoned to him as righteousness.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">But the words, »it was reckoned to him,« were written not for his sake alone,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">but for us also. It will be reckoned to us who believe in him who raised from the dead Jesus our Lord,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">who was delivered to death for our sins and was raised for our justification.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="5">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Therefore, since we have been justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">through whom we have obtained access by faith into this grace in which we stand, and we rejoice in our hope of the glory of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And not only that, but we rejoice in our sufferings, knowing that suffering produces perseverance;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">and perseverance, character; and character, hope.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And hope does not disappoint us, because God has poured out his love into our hearts by the Holy Spirit who has been given to us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">When we were still weak, at the right time Christ died for the ungodly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Why, one will hardly die for a righteous manthough perhaps for a good man one will dare even to die.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">But God demonstrates his own love for us, in that while we were still sinners Christ died for us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Since, therefore, we have now been justified by his blood, much more shall we be saved through him from the wrath of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">For if, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God through the death of his Son, much more, having been reconciled, shall we be saved by his life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Not only so, but we also rejoice in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now received our reconciliation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Therefore, just as sin entered the world through one man, and death through sin, so death spread to all men, because all men sinned.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">For sin was in the world before the law was given, but sin is not counted when there is no law.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Nevertheless death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over those whose sins were not like the transgression of Adam, who was a type of the one who was to come.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">But the free gift is not like the trespass. For if by the one man's trespass many died, much more the grace of God and the gift by the grace of the one man, Jesus Christ, abounded to many.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And the free gift is not like the effect of that one man's sin. For the judgment following one trespass brought condemnation, but the gift following many trespasses brings justification.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">For if, by the one man's trespass, death reigned through that one man, much more will those who receive the abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness reign in life through the one man Jesus Christ.)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">So then, as one man's trespass led to condemnation for all men, so one mans act of righteousness leads to justification and life for all men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">For just as through the disobedience of the one man the many were made sinners, so also through the obedience of the one man the many will be made righteous.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Law came in, that the trespass might increase. But where sin increased, grace abounded all the more,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">so that, as sin reigned in death, grace also might reign through righteousness to eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="6">
      <VERS vnumber="1">What shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin that grace may abound?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Certainly not! How can we who died to sin live any longer in it?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Or do you not know that all of us who were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">We were buried therefore with him through baptism into death, so that just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, we too might walk in newness of life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">For if we have been united with him in a death like his, we shall certainly also be united with him in a resurrection like his.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">We know that our old self was crucified with him so that the body of sin might be done away with, that we should no longer be slaves to sin.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">For he who has died has been freed from sin.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Now if we died with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">For we know that Christ, being raised from the dead, will never die again; death no longer has dominion over him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">The death he died, he died to sin once for all; but the life he lives, he lives to God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">So you also, consider yourselves dead to sin but alive to God in Christ Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Therefore do not let sin reign in your mortal body, that you obey its passions.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Do not yield your members to sin as instruments of wickedness, but yield yourselves to God as men who have been brought from death to life, and your members to God as instruments of righteousness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">For sin shall not have dominion over you, since you are not under law but under grace.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">What then? Shall we sin because we are not under law but under grace? Certainly not!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Do you not know that if you yield yourselves to any one to obey as slaves, you are slaves of the one whom you obey, whether of sin, which leads to death, or of obedience, which leads to righteousness?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">But thanks be to God, that you who were once slaves of sin have become obedient from the heart to the standard of teaching to which you were committed,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">and, having been set free from sin, you have become slaves of righteousness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">I am speaking in human terms, because of the weakness of your flesh. For just as you once yielded your members to impurity and to greater and greater iniquity, so now yield your members to righteousness for holiness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">When you were slaves of sin, you were free in regard to righteousness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">But then what return did you get from the things of which you are now ashamed? The end of those things is death.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">But now that you have been set free from sin and have become slaves of God, the return you get is holiness and its end, eternal life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="7">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Do you not know, brethrenfor I am speaking to those who know the lawthat the law has authority over a man only as long as he lives?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">For a married woman is bound by law to her husband as long as he lives, but if her husband dies she is released from the law of her husband.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">So then, she will be called an adulteress if she lives with another man while her husband is alive. But if her husband dies, she is free from that law, and though she marries another man, she is not an adulteress.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Likewise, my brethren, you have died to the law through the body of Christ, so that you may belong to another, to him who was raised from the dead, in order that we may bear fruit to God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">While we were living in the flesh, our sinful passions, aroused by the law, were at work in our members to bear fruit for death.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But now, by dying to what once held us, we have been released from the law so that we serve in the new way of the Spirit, and not in the old way of the written code.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">What shall we say, then? Is the law sin? Certainly not! Indeed, I would not have known what sin was except through the law. For I would not have known what coveting really was if the law had not said, »You shall not covet.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">But sin, finding opportunity by the commandment, produced in me all kinds of covetous desire. For apart from the law sin lies dead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">I was once alive apart from the law, but when the commandment came, sin sprang to life and I died.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">The very commandment which was to bring life I found to be death to me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">For sin, finding opportunity in the commandment, deceived me, and by it killed me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">So the law is holy, and the commandment is holy and just and good.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Did that which is good, then, become death to me? Certainly not! But it was sin, working death in me through what is good, in order that sin might be recognized as sin, so that through the commandment sin might become sinful beyond measure.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">We know that the law is spiritual; but I am carnal, sold under sin.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">I do not understand what I do. For I do not do what I want to do, but I do what I hate.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Now if I do what I do not want to do, I agree that the law is good.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">So then, it is no longer I who do it, but sin that dwells within me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">For I know that nothing good dwells within me, that is, in my flesh. I can will to do what is good, but I cannot do it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">For I do not do the good I want to do; but the evil I do not want to do is what I do.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Now if I do what I do not want to do, it is no longer I who do it, but sin that dwells within me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">So I find it to be a law that when I want to do good, evil is present with me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">For I delight in the law of God, in my inner being,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">but I see in my members another law, at war against the law of my mind and making me captive to the law of sin which dwells in my members.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Wretched man that I am! Who will deliver me from this body of death?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Thanks be to Godthrough Jesus Christ our Lord! So then, I of myself serve the law of God with my mind, but with my flesh I serve the law of sin.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="8">
      <VERS vnumber="1">There is therefore now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has set me free from the law of sin and death.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">For what the law could not do, in that it was weakened through the flesh, God did by sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin: he condemned sin in the flesh,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">in order that the righteous requirement of the law might be fulfilled in us, who do not walk according to the flesh but according to the Spirit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">For those who live according to the flesh set their minds on the things of the flesh, but those who live according to the Spirit set their minds on the things of the Spirit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">To set the mind on the flesh is death, but to set the mind on the Spirit is life and peace.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">For the mind that is set on the flesh is hostile to God; it does not submit to God's law, nor can it do so;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">and those who are in the flesh cannot please God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">But you are not in the flesh, you are in the Spirit, if in fact the Spirit of God dwells in you. And if anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ he does not belong to him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">But if Christ is in you, although your body is dead because of sin, your spirit is alive because of righteousness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">If the Spirit of him who raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you, he who raised Christ from the dead will give life to your mortal bodies also through his Spirit who dwells in you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Therefore, brethren, we are debtorsnot to the flesh, to live according to the flesh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">For if you live according to the flesh you will die; but if by the Spirit you put to death the deeds of the body, you will live.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">For all who are led by the Spirit of God are sons of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">For you did not receive the spirit of bondage again to fear, but you received the Spirit of sonship by whom we cry out, »Abba, Father.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">The Spirit himself bears witness with our spirit that we are children of God,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">and if children, then heirsheirs of God and fellow heirs with Christ, if indeed we suffer with him, in order that we may also be glorified with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">I consider that the sufferings of this present time are not worth comparing with the glory that is to be revealed in us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">For the creation waits with eager expectation for the revealing of the sons of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">For the creation was subjected to futility, not of its own will, but by the will of him who subjected it in hope;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">because the creation itself will be set free from its bondage to decay and obtain the glorious liberty of the children of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">We know that the whole creation has been groaning in birth pangs together until now.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And not only the creation, but we ourselves, who have the firstfruits of the Spirit, groan inwardly as we wait eagerly for adoption as sons, the redemption of our bodies.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">For in this hope we were saved. But hope that is seen is not hope. For who hopes for what he sees?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">But if we hope for what we do not see, we wait for it with patience.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Likewise the Spirit helps us in our weakness; for we do not know what to pray for as we ought, but the Spirit himself intercedes for us with groans that words cannot express.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And he who searches the hearts of men knows what is the mind of the Spirit, because the Spirit intercedes for the saints according to the will of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And we know that in all things God works for the good of those who love him, who are called according to his purpose.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">For those whom he foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brethren.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And those whom he predestined, he also called; those whom he called, he also justified; and those whom he justified, he also glorified.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">What then shall we say to this? If God is for us, who can be against us?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">He who did not spare his own Son, but gave him up for us all, how will he not also give us all things with him?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">Who shall bring any charge against God's elect? It is God who justifies.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Who is he who condemns? It is Christ Jesus, who died, yes, who was raised from the dead, who is at the right hand of God, who is also interceding for us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword?</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="37">No, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him who loved us.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="39">nor height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="6">But it is not as though the word of God had failed. For not all who are descended from Israel are Israel,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="8">In other words, it is not the children of the flesh who are the children of God, but the children of the promise are reckoned as descendants.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">For this is what the promise said: »About this time I will return and Sarah shall have a son.«</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="11">The scripture says, »No one who believes in him will be put to shame.«</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">I ask, then, has God rejected his people? Certainly not! I myself am an Israelite, a descendant of Abraham, a member of the tribe of Benjamin.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">God has not rejected his people whom he foreknew. Do you not know what the scripture says of Elijah, how he pleads with God against Israel?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">»Lord, they have killed your prophets and torn down your altars, and I alone am left, and they seek my life.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">But what is God's reply to him? »I have reserved for myself seven thousand men who have not bowed the knee to Baal.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">So too at the present time there is a remnant, chosen by grace.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And if it is by grace, then it is no longer on the basis of works; otherwise, grace would no longer be grace.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">What then? Israel did not obtain what it sought. The elect obtained it, but the rest were hardened,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">as it is written: <STYLE css="display:block;text-indent:5mm">»God gave them a spirit of stupor,</STYLE><STYLE css="display:block;text-indent:10mm">eyes that they should not see</STYLE><STYLE css="display:block;text-indent:10mm">and ears that they should not hear,</STYLE><STYLE css="display:block;text-indent:5mm">down to this very day.«</STYLE></VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And David says: <STYLE css="display:block;text-indent:5mm">»Let their table become a snare and a trap,</STYLE><STYLE css="display:block;text-indent:10mm">a stumbling block and a retribution for them.</STYLE></VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">
        <STYLE css="display:block;text-indent:5mm">Let their eyes be darkened so that they cannot see,</STYLE>
        <STYLE css="display:block;text-indent:10mm">and bend their backs forever.«</STYLE>
      </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">So I ask, have they stumbled so as to fall? Certainly not! But through their trespass salvation has come to the Gentiles, to make Israel jealous.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Now if their trespass means riches for the world, and if their failure means riches for the Gentiles, how much more will their fullness mean!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Now I am speaking to you Gentiles. Inasmuch then as I am an apostle to the Gentiles, I magnify my ministry</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">in the hope that I may somehow arouse to jealousy the kinsmen of my flesh and save some of them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">For if their rejection is the reconciliation of the world, what will their acceptance be but life from the dead?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">If the dough offered as firstfruits is holy, then the whole lump is holy; and if the root is holy, so are the branches.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And if some of the branches were broken off, and you, a wild olive shoot, were grafted in among the rest to share the root of the olive tree,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">do not boast over the branches. If you do boast, remember that you do not support the root, but the root supports you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">You will say then, »Branches were broken off so that I might be grafted in.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">That is true. They were broken off because of their unbelief, but you stand fast only by faith. So do not be proud, but stand in awe.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">For if God did not spare the natural branches, he will not spare you either.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Therefore consider the kindness and the severity of God: severity toward those who fell, but kindness to you, provided you continue in his kindness; otherwise you also will be cut off.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And they also, if they do not persist in unbelief, will be grafted in, for God is able to graft them in again.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">For if you were cut out of an olive tree that is wild by nature, and were grafted, contrary to nature, into a cultivated olive tree, how much more will these natural branches be grafted back into their own olive tree!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">I do not want you to be ignorant of this mystery, brothers, so that you may not be conceited: Israel has experienced a hardening in part until the full number of the Gentiles has come in.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And so all Israel will be saved, as it is written: <STYLE css="display:block;text-indent:5mm">»The Deliverer will come from Zion,</STYLE><STYLE css="display:block;text-indent:10mm">he will turn away ungodliness from Jacob;</STYLE></VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">
        <STYLE css="display:block;text-indent:5mm">and this will be my covenant with them</STYLE>
        <STYLE css="display:block;text-indent:10mm">when I take away their sins.«</STYLE>
      </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">As regards the gospel they are enemies of God, for your sake; but as regards election they are beloved for the sake of their forefathers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">For the gifts and the call of God are irrevocable.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Just as you were once disobedient to God but now have received mercy because of their disobedience,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">so they have now been disobedient in order that by the mercy shown to you they also may receive mercy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">For God has bound all men over to disobedience, that he may have mercy upon all.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">Oh, the depth of the riches and of the wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable are his judgments and his ways past finding out!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">
        <STYLE css="display:block;text-indent:5mm">»For who has known the mind of the Lord?</STYLE>
        <STYLE css="display:block;text-indent:10mm">Or who has been his counselor?«</STYLE>
      </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">

    <CHAPTER cnumber="12">
      <VERS vnumber="1">I appeal to you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, to present your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and acceptable to God, which is your spiritual worship.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Do not be conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, that you may prove what is the will of God, what is good and acceptable and perfect.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">For by the grace given to me I say to every one among you not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think, but to think with sober judgment, each according to the measure of faith which God has assigned him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">For as in one body we have many members, and all the members do not have the same function,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">so we, though many, are one body in Christ, and individually members one of another.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Having gifts that differ according to the grace given to us, let us use them: if prophecy, in proportion to our faith;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">if service, let us use it in our serving; he who teaches, in his teaching;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">he who exhorts, in exhortation; he who gives, with liberality; he who leads, with diligence; he who does acts of mercy, with cheerfulness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Let love be genuine. Hate what is evil; cling to what is good.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Be devoted to one another in brotherly love; outdo one another in showing honor.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Never be lacking in zeal, be fervent in spirit, serving the Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Rejoice in your hope, be patient in tribulation, be faithful in prayer.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Contribute to the needs of the saints, practice hospitality.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Bless those who persecute you; bless and do not curse.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Rejoice with those who rejoice, weep with those who weep.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Live in harmony with one another. Do not be proud, but associate with the lowly. Do not be conceited.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Repay no one evil for evil, but have regard for what is noble in the sight of all.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">If it is possible, as far as it depends on you, live peaceably with all.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Beloved, do not avenge yourselves, but leave it to the wrath of God; for it is written, »Vengeance is mine, I will repay,« says the Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">No, »if your enemy is hungry, feed him; if he is thirsty, give him drink; for in so doing you will heap burning coals on his head.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="13">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Let every person be subject to the governing authorities. For there is no authority except from God, and the authorities that exist have been instituted by God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Therefore he who resists the authority resists what God has appointed, and those who resist will bring judgment on themselves.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">For rulers are not a terror to good works, but to evil. Do you want to have no fear of him who is in authority? Then do what is good, and you will have praise from him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">For he is God's servant to you for good. But if you do wrong, be afraid, for he does not bear the sword in vain; he is Gods servant, an avenger to execute wrath on the wrongdoer.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Therefore one must be subject, not only because of wrath but also for the sake of conscience.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">For the same reason you also pay taxes, for the authorities are God's ministers, attending to this very thing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Pay all of them their dues: taxes to whom taxes are due, revenue to whom revenue is due, respect to whom respect is due, honor to whom honor is due.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Owe no one anything, except to love one another; for he who loves his neighbor has fulfilled the law.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">The commandments, »You shall not commit adultery,« »You shall not murder,« »You shall not steal,« »You shall not covet,« and any other commandment there may be, are summed up in this sentence, »You shall love your neighbor as yourself.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Love does no harm to a neighbor; therefore love is the fulfillment of the law.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And do this, knowing the hour, that now it is full time for you to wake from sleep. For now our salvation is nearer than when we first believed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">The night is far gone, the day is at hand. Let us then cast off the works of darkness and put on the armor of light.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Let us walk properly, as in the day, not in reveling and drunkenness, not in lewdness and lust, not in quarreling and jealousy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">But put on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make no provision for the flesh, to gratify its desires.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="14">
      <VERS vnumber="1">As for the man who is weak in faith, accept him, but not for disputes over opinions.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">One believes he may eat anything, but the man whose faith is weak eats only vegetables.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Let not him who eats despise him who does not, and let not him who does not eat pass judgment on him who eats; for God has accepted him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Who are you to judge the servant of another? To his own master he stands or falls. And he will be made to stand, for the Master is able to make him stand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">One man esteems one day as better than another; another man esteems every day alike. Let each one be fully convinced in his own mind.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">He who observes the day, observes it to the Lord. He who eats, eats to the Lord, for he gives thanks to God; and he who abstains, does so to the Lord and gives thanks to God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">For none of us lives to himself, and none of us dies to himself.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">If we live, we live to the Lord; and if we die, we die to the Lord. So then, whether we live or whether we die, we are the Lord's.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">For to this end Christ died and lived again, that he might be Lord both of the dead and of the living.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Why do you judge your brother? Or you, why do you despise your brother? For we shall all stand before the judgment seat of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">For it is written: <STYLE css="display:block;text-indent:5mm">»As I live, says the Lord, every knee shall bow to me,</STYLE><STYLE css="display:block;text-indent:10mm">and every tongue shall confess to God.«</STYLE></VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">So then each of us shall give account of himself to God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Therefore let us not pass judgment on one another anymore, but rather decide never to put a stumbling block or hindrance in our brothers way.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">I know and am convinced in the Lord Jesus that nothing is unclean in itself; but if anyone regards something as unclean, then for him it is unclean.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">If your brother is distressed because of what you eat, you are no longer walking in love. Do not by your eating destroy the one for whom Christ died.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">So do not let your good be spoken of as evil.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">For the kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">he who serves Christ in this way is acceptable to God and approved by men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Let us therefore pursue what makes for peace and for mutual edification.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Do not, for the sake of food, destroy the work of God. Everything is indeed clean, but it is wrong for a man to eat anything that causes someone else to stumble.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">It is right not to eat meat or drink wine or do anything that makes your brother stumble.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">The faith that you have, keep between yourself and God. Happy is he who does not condemn himself for what he approves.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">But he who has doubts is condemned if he eats, because he does not act from faith; for whatever is not from faith is sin.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="15">
      <VERS vnumber="1">We who are strong ought to bear with the failings of the weak, and not to please ourselves.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Let each of us please his neighbor for his good, to build him up.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">For even Christ did not please himself; but, as it is written, »The reproaches of those who reproached you fell on me.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">For whatever was written in former days was written for our instruction, that through perseverance and the encouragement of the scriptures we might have hope.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">May the God of patience and encouragement grant you to live in harmony with one another, according to Christ Jesus,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">that you may with one mind and one mouth glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Therefore, welcome one another, just as Christ also welcomed you, to the glory of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">For I tell you that Christ has become a servant of the circumcised to show God's truth, to confirm the promises made to the patriarchs,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">and in order that the Gentiles might glorify God for his mercy. As it is written: <STYLE css="display:block;text-indent:5mm">»Therefore I will praise you among the Gentiles,</STYLE><STYLE css="display:block;text-indent:10mm">and sing to your name«;</STYLE></VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">and again it says: <STYLE css="display:block;text-indent:5mm">»Rejoice, O Gentiles, with his people!«</STYLE></VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">and again, <STYLE css="display:block;text-indent:5mm">»Praise the Lord, all you Gentiles,</STYLE><STYLE css="display:block;text-indent:10mm">and praise him, all you peoples«;</STYLE></VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And again, Isaiah says: <STYLE css="display:block;text-indent:5mm">»There shall be a root of Jesse;</STYLE><STYLE css="display:block;text-indent:10mm">and he who shall rise to rule over the Gentiles,</STYLE><STYLE css="display:block;text-indent:5mm">in him the Gentiles shall hope.«</STYLE></VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">May the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, so that by the power of the Holy Spirit you may abound in hope.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">I myself am satisfied about you, my brethren, that you yourselves are full of goodness, filled with all knowledge, and able to instruct one another.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">But I have written very boldly to you on some points, so as to remind you again, because of the grace that was given me from God,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">to be a minister of Christ Jesus to the Gentiles in the priestly service of the gospel of God, so that the offering of the Gentiles might be acceptable, sanctified by the Holy Spirit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Therefore I have reason to glory in Christ Jesus in my service to God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">For I will not venture to speak of anything except what Christ has accomplished through me to win obedience from the Gentiles, by word and deed</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">by the power of signs and wonders, by the power of the Spirit, so that from Jerusalem and as far round as Illyricum I have fully preached the gospel of Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And so I have made it my ambition to preach the gospel, not where Christ has already been named, lest I build on another man's foundation,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">but as it is written: <STYLE css="display:block;text-indent:5mm">»They shall see who have not been told of him,</STYLE><STYLE css="display:block;text-indent:10mm">and those who have not heard shall understand.«</STYLE></VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">This is the reason why I have often been hindered from coming to you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">But now, since I no longer have any place for work in these regions, and since I have longed for many years to come to you,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">I plan to do so when I go to Spain. I hope to see you while passing through, and to be helped by you on my journey there, after I have enjoyed your company for a while.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Now, however, I am going to Jerusalem with aid for the saints.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">For Macedonia and Achaia have been pleased to make a contribution for the poor among the saints in Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">They were pleased to do it, and indeed they are in debt to them. For if the Gentiles have come to share in their spiritual blessings, they ought also to be of service to them in material blessings.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">When therefore I have completed this, and have delivered to them this fruit, I shall go on by way of you to Spain.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And I know that when I come to you, I shall come in the fullness of the blessing of Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Now I urge you, brethren, by our Lord Jesus Christ and by the love of the Spirit, to strive together with me in your prayers to God for me,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">that I may be delivered from the unbelievers in Judea, and that my service for Jerusalem may be acceptable to the saints,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Paul, called to be an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, and our brother Sosthenes,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">to the church of God which is at Corinth, to those sanctified in Christ Jesus, called to be saints together with all those who in every place call on the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, both their Lord and ours:</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="18">For the word of the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="22">Jews demand signs and Greeks look for wisdom,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">but we preach Christ crucified, to Jews a stumbling block and to Gentiles foolishness,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">but to those who are the called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">For the foolishness of God is wiser than men, and the weakness of God is stronger than men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">For consider your call, brethren; not many of you were wise according to fleshly standards, not many were powerful, not many were of noble birth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">But God chose the foolish things of the world to shame the wise, God chose the weak things of the world to shame the strong,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">God chose the lowly things of this world and the despised things, and the things that are not, to nullify the things that are,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">so that no flesh may boast before God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">It is because of him that you are in Christ Jesus, who became to us wisdom from God, and righteousness and sanctification, and redemption,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">therefore, as it is written, »Let him who boasts, boast in the Lord.«</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="2">
      <VERS vnumber="1">When I came to you, brethren, I did not come with superiority of speech or of wisdom, proclaiming to you the testimony of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">For I resolved to know nothing among you except Jesus Christ, and him crucified.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">I was with you in weakness and in fear and in much trembling,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">and my message and my preaching were not in persuasive words of wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">so that your faith might not rest on the wisdom of men, but on the power of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Yet we do speak a wisdom among the mature, a wisdom, however, not of this age nor of the rulers of this age, who are passing away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">But we speak of God's secret wisdom, a wisdom that has been hidden and which God destined for our glory before the ages.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">None of the rulers of this age understood it; for if they had, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">But, as it is written, <STYLE css="display:block;text-indent:5mm">»No eye has seen, nor ear heard,</STYLE><STYLE css="display:block;text-indent:10mm">nor the heart of man conceived</STYLE><STYLE css="display:block;text-indent:5mm">what God has prepared for those who love him,«</STYLE></VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="12">Now we have received not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit who is from God, that we may understand the things freely given to us by God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">This is what we speak, not in words taught us by human wisdom but in words taught by the Spirit, expressing spiritual truths in spiritual words.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">But the natural man does not accept the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him; and he cannot understand them, because they are spiritually discerned.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">But I, brethren, could not address you as spiritual men, but as carnal men, as infants in Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">I gave you milk, not solid food; for you were not yet ready for it. Indeed, even now you are not ready,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">for you are still carnal. For since there is jealousy and strife among you, are you not carnal, and are you not walking like mere men?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">For when one says, »I am of Paul,« and another, »I am of Apollos,« are you not mere men?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">What then is Apollos? And what is Paul? Servants through whom you believed, even as the Lord assigned to each one.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">I planted, Apollos watered, but God was causing the growth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">So neither he who plants nor he who waters is anything, but only God who gives the growth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Now he who plants and he who waters are one, and each will receive his own reward according to his own labor.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">For we are God's fellow workers; you are Gods field, Gods building.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">According to the grace of God which was given to me, like a wise master builder I laid a foundation, and another is building on it. But each man must be careful how he builds on it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">For no other foundation can any one lay than the one which is laid, which is Jesus Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Now if any man builds on the foundation with gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, straw,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">each man's work will become evident; for the day will show it, because it is to be revealed with fire, and the fire itself will test the quality of each mans work.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="15">If any man's work is burned up, he will suffer loss; but he himself will be saved, but only as through fire.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="17">If any one destroys God's temple, God will destroy him. For Gods temple is holy, and that temple you are.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Let no one deceive himself. If any one among you thinks that he is wise in this age, he must become a fool so that he may become wise.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="4">
      <VERS vnumber="1">This is how one should regard us, as servants of Christ and stewards of the mysteries of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Moreover it is required of stewards that they be found trustworthy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">But with me it is a very small thing that I should be judged by you, or by any human court; I do not even judge myself.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">I am not aware of anything against myself, but I am not acquitted by this. It is the Lord who judges me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Therefore do not go on passing judgment before the time, but wait until the Lord comes who will both bring to light the things hidden in the darkness and disclose the motives of men's hearts. Then every man will receive his praise from God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Now these things, brethren, I have figuratively applied to myself and Apollos for your benefit, so that in us you may learn not to go beyond what is written, so that no one of you will become arrogant in favor of one against the other.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">For who regards you as different? What do you have that you did not receive? And if you did receive it, why do you boast as if you had not received it?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">You are already filled! You have already become rich! You have become kings without us! And indeed, I wish that you had become kings so that we also might reign with you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">For, I think that God has exhibited us apostles last of all, like men condemned to death; because we have become a spectacle to the world, both to angels and to men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">We are fools for Christ's sake, but you are wise in Christ; we are weak, but you are strong; you are distinguished, but we are without honor.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">To this present hour we are both hungry and thirsty, and we are poorly clothed, and roughly treated, and homeless;</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="13">when we are slandered, we try to conciliate; we have become, and are now, as the scum of the world, the refuse of all things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">I do not write this to shame you, but to admonish you as my beloved children.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">For though you have countless guides in Christ, you do not have many fathers, for in Christ Jesus I became your father through the gospel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Therefore I urge you, be imitators of me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">For this reason I have sent to you Timothy, who is my beloved and faithful child in the Lord, and he will remind you of my ways which are in Christ, just as I teach everywhere in every church.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Now some have become arrogant, as though I were not coming to you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">But I will come to you soon, if the Lord wills, and I will find out, not the words of these arrogant people, but their power.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">For the kingdom of God does not consist in talk but in power.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="5">
      <VERS vnumber="1">It is actually reported that there is immorality among you, and of a kind that does not occur even among pagans: a man has his father's wife.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And you are arrogant! Ought you not rather to have mourned? Let the one who has done this be removed from your midst.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">For though I am absent in body, I am present in spirit, and have already passed judgment on the one who has committed this, as if I were present.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">In the name of our Lord Jesus, when you are assembled, and I with you in spirit, and the power of our Lord Jesus is present,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">you are to deliver this man to Satan for the destruction of the flesh, so that his spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Your boasting is not good. Do you not know that a little leaven leavens the whole lump of dough?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Cleanse out the old leaven that you may be a new lump, as you really are unleavened. For Christ, our Passover lamb, has been sacrificed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Let us, therefore, celebrate the festival, not with the old leaven, the leaven of malice and wickedness, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">I wrote you in my letter not to associate with immoral people;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">not at all meaning the immoral people of this world, or with the greedy and swindlers, or with idolaters, for then you would have to go out of the world.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">But actually, I wrote to you not to associate with any one who bears the name of brother if he is an immoral person, or greedy, or an idolater, or a reviler, or a drunkard, or a swindlernot even to eat with such a one.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">For what have I to do with judging outsiders? Is it not those inside the church whom you are to judge?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">God judges those outside. »Expel the wicked man from among you.«</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="6">
      <VERS vnumber="1">When any one of you has a grievance against a brother, does he dare go to law before the unrighteous instead of before the saints?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Do you not know that the saints will judge the world? And if the world is to be judged by you, are you not competent to try trivial cases?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Do you not know that we will judge angels? How much more matters of this life!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">So if you have disputes about such matters, do you appoint them as judges who are of no account in the church?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">I say this to your shame. Can it be that there is no man among you wise enough to decide between his brethren,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">but brother goes to law against brother, and that before unbelievers?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Actually, then, it is already a defeat for you, that you have lawsuits with one another. Why not rather be wronged? Why not rather be defrauded?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Instead, you yourselves defraud and do wrong, and you even do this to your brethren.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Or do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived; neither the immoral, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor sexual perverts,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">nor thieves, nor the greedy, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And such were some of you. But you were washed, you were sanctified, you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and in the Spirit of our God.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="13">»Food is for the stomach and the stomach for food«but God will destroy them both. The body is not meant for immorality, but for the Lord, and the Lord for the body.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="15">Do you not know that your bodies are members of Christ? Shall I then take the members of Christ and make them members of a prostitute? Never!</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="17">But he who unites himself with the Lord is one spirit with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Flee immorality. Every other sin that a man commits is outside the body, but the immoral man sins against his own body.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="7">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now concerning the matters about which you wrote, it is good for a man not to touch a woman.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">But because of immorality, each man should have his own wife, and each woman her own husband.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">The husband should fulfill his marital duty to his wife, and likewise the wife to her husband.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">The wife does not have authority over her own body, but the husband does; and likewise also the husband does not have authority over his own body, but the wife does.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Do not deprive one another, except by agreement for a time, so that you may devote yourselves to prayer, and then come together again so that Satan will not tempt you because of your lack of self-control.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">I say this by way of concession, not of command.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">I wish that all men were as I myself am. But each man has his own gift from God, one in this manner and another in that.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">But I say to the unmarried and to the widows that it is good for them if they remain even as I.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">But if they cannot exercise self-control, they should marry; for it is better to marry than to burn with passion.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">To the married I give charge, not I but the Lord, that the wife should not separate from her husband</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">(but if she does leave, she must remain unmarried, or else be reconciled to her husband), and that the husband should not divorce his wife.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">But to the rest I say, not the Lord, that if any brother has a wife who is an unbeliever, and she consents to live with him, he must not divorce her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">If any woman has a husband who is an unbeliever, and he consents to live with her, she must not divorce him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">For the unbelieving husband is sanctified through his wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified through her husband. Otherwise, your children would be unclean, but as it is they are holy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">But if the unbelieving partner leaves, let him do so; in such a case the brother or sister is not bound. For God has called us to peace.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">For how do you know, O wife, whether you will save your husband? Or how do you know, O husband, whether you will save your wife?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Only, let each one lead the life which the Lord has assigned to him, and in which God has called him. This is the rule I lay down in all the churches.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Was any man called when he was already circumcised? He is not to become uncircumcised. Has anyone been called in uncircumcision? He is not to be circumcised.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Circumcision is nothing and uncircumcision is nothing, but keeping the commandments of God is what counts.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Each one should remain in the state in which he was called.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Were you a slave when you were called? Do not let it trouble youbut if you can gain your freedom, do so.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">For he who was called in the Lord as a slave is the Lord's freedman; likewise he who was free when called is Christ's slave.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">You were bought with a price; do not become slaves of men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Brethren, let each one remain with God in that condition in which he was called.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Now concerning virgins, I have no command of the Lord, but I give my opinion as one who by the Lord's mercy is trustworthy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">I think that in view of the present distress it is good for a person to remain as he is.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Are you bound to a wife? Do not seek to be free. Are you free from a wife? Do not seek marriage.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">But if you marry, you have not sinned; and if a virgin marries, she has not sinned. Yet those who marry will have troubles in this flesh, and I am trying to spare you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">I mean, brethren, the appointed time has grown very short; so that from now on, those who have wives should live as though they had none,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">and those who mourn, as though they were not mourning; and those who rejoice, as though they were not rejoicing; and those who buy, as though they did not possess;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">and those who use the world, as though they did not make full use of it. For the form of this world is passing away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">But I want you to be free from concern. One who is unmarried is concerned about the affairs of the Lord, how he may please the Lord;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">but a married man is concerned about the affairs of the world, how he may please his wife,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">and his interests are divided. The unmarried woman, and the virgin, is concerned about the affairs of the Lord, that she may be holy both in body and spirit; but the married woman is concerned about the affairs of the world, how she may please her husband.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">This I say for your own benefit, not to put a restraint upon you, but to promote what is good and to secure undivided devotion to the Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">But if any man thinks that he is not acting properly toward his betrothed, if she is past her youth, and if it must be so, let him do what he wishes, he does not sin; let them marry.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">But he who stands firm in his heart, being under no constraint, but has control over his own will, and has decided this in his own heart, to keep her as his betrothed, he will do well.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">So then he who marries his betrothed does well, and he who does not marry her will do better.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">A wife is bound to her husband as long as he lives. But if her husband dies, she is free to be married to whom she wishes, only in the Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">But in my judgment she is happier if she remains as she is; and I think that I also have the Spirit of God.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="8">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now concerning food sacrificed to idols: we know that we all possess knowledge. Knowledge puffs up, but love builds up.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">If anyone imagines that he knows something, he does not yet know as he ought to know.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">But if anyone loves God, he is known by him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Therefore concerning the eating of food sacrificed to idols, we know that an idol is nothing in the world, and that there is no God but one.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">For even if there are so-called gods, whether in heaven or on earth (as indeed there are many »gods« and many »lords«),</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="7">However, not all possess this knowledge. But some, being accustomed to idols, eat food as really sacrificed to an idol; and their conscience, being weak, is defiled.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">But food will not commend us to God; we are no worse if we do not eat, and no better if we do.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">But take care that this liberty of yours does not somehow become a stumbling block to the weak.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">For if a man sees you, who have knowledge, at table in an idol's temple, will not his conscience, if he is weak, be encouraged to eat food sacrificed to idols?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And so by your knowledge this weak man is destroyed, the brother for whom Christ died.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Thus, sinning against your brethren and wounding their conscience when it is weak, you sin against Christ.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">For I do not want you to be unaware, brethren, that our fathers were all under the cloud and all passed through the sea;</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">and all ate the same spiritual food;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">and all drank the same spiritual drink, for they drank from a spiritual rock which followed them; and the rock was Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Nevertheless, with most of them God was not pleased; for they were overthrown in the wilderness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Now these things are examples for us, not to desire evil things as they did.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="13">No temptation has overtaken you but such as is common to man. And God is faithful, who will not let you be tempted beyond what you are able, but with the temptation will provide the way of escape also, so that you will be able to endure it.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="18">Consider Israel after the flesh; are not those who eat the sacrifices partners in the altar?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">What do I mean then? That a thing offered to idols is anything, or that an idol is anything?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">No, but I say that the things pagans sacrifice they offer to demons and not to God. I do not want you to be partners with demons.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="2">I praise you because you remember me in everything and hold firmly to the traditions, just as I delivered them to you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">But I want you to understand that Christ is the head of every man, and the man is the head of a woman, and God is the head of Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Every man who prays or prophesies with his head covered dishonors his head.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">But every woman who prays or prophesies with her head uncovered dishonors her headit is the same as if her head were shaved.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">For if a woman does not cover her head, she should have her hair cut off; but if it is disgraceful for a woman to have her hair cut or shaved off, let her cover her head.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">For a man ought not to cover his head, since he is the image and glory of God; but the woman is the glory of man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">For man does not originate from woman, but woman from man;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">neither was man created for woman, but woman for man.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="11">In the Lord, however, woman is not independent of man, nor is man independent of woman.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="13">Judge for yourselves: is it proper for a woman to pray to God with her head uncovered?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Does not even nature itself teach you that if a man has long hair, it is a dishonor to him,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">but if a woman has long hair, it is her glory? For her hair is given to her for a covering.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">If anyone wants to be contentious, we have no other practice, nor do the churches of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">But in the following instructions, I do not praise you, because you come together not for the better but for the worse.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">For, in the first place, when you come together as a church, I hear that there are divisions among you; and I partly believe it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">For there must be factions among you in order that those who are genuine among you may be recognized.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Therefore when you meet together, it is not the Lord's supper that you eat,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">for in eating, each one goes ahead with his own meal, and one is hungry and another is drunk.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">What! Do you not have houses to eat and drink in? Or do you despise the church of God and humiliate those who have nothing? What shall I say to you? Shall I praise you in this? No, I will not.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">For I received from the Lord what I also delivered to you, that the Lord Jesus on the night when he was betrayed took bread,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">and when he had given thanks, he broke it and said, »This is my body, which is for you; do this in remembrance of me.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">In the same way he took the cup also after supper, saying, »This cup is the new covenant in my blood; do this, as often as you drink it, in remembrance of me.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">For as often as you eat this bread and drink the cup, you proclaim the Lord's death until he comes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Whoever, therefore, eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner will be guilty of profaning the body and blood of the Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Let a man examine himself, and so eat of the bread and drink of the cup.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">For anyone who eats and drinks without recognizing the body eats and drinks judgment on himself.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">That is why many among you are weak and sick, and a number of you have fallen asleep.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">But if we judged ourselves rightly, we would not be judged.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">But when we are judged, we are disciplined by the Lord so that we will not be condemned along with the world.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">So then, my brethren, when you come together to eat, wait for one another.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">If anyone is hungry, let him eat at home, so that you will not come together for judgment. About the other things I will give directions when I come.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Now concerning spiritual gifts, brethren, I do not want you to be uninformed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">You know that when you were pagans, you were led astray to mute idols, however you may have been moved.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Therefore I tell you that no one who is speaking by the Spirit of God says, »Jesus be cursed,« and no one can say, »Jesus is Lord,« except by the Holy Spirit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Now there are varieties of gifts, but the same Spirit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And there are varieties of service, but the same Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">There are varieties of working, but the same God who works all of them in all men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">But to each one is given the manifestation of the Spirit for the common good.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">To one is given through the Spirit the word of wisdom, and to another the word of knowledge according to the same Spirit,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">to another faith by the same Spirit, to another gifts of healing by the one Spirit,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">and to another the working of miracles, and to another prophecy, and to another distinguishing between spirits, to another various kinds of tongues, and to another the interpretation of tongues.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">But one and the same Spirit works all these things, distributing to each one individually just as he wills.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">For just as the body is one and has many members, and all the members of the body, though they are many, are one body, so it is with Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">For by one Spirit we were all baptized into one bodywhether Jews or Greeks, slaves or freeand we were all made to drink of one Spirit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">For the body is not made up of one member but of many.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">If the foot should say, »Because I am not a hand, I do not belong to the body,« it would not for that reason be any less a part of the body.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And if the ear should say, »Because I am not an eye, I do not belong to the body,« it would not for that reason be any less a part of the body.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">If the whole body were an eye, where would be the hearing? If the whole body were an ear, where would be the sense of smell?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">But now God has arranged the members in the body, each one of them, just as he desired.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">If they were all one member, where would the body be?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">As it is, there are many parts, but one body.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And the eye cannot say to the hand, »I have no need of you,« nor again the head to the feet, »I have no need of you.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">On the contrary, the parts of the body that seem to be weaker are indispensable,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">and those parts of the body which we think less honorable we treat with the greater honor, and our unpresentable parts are treated with greater modesty,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">while our more presentable members have no need of it. But God has so composed the body, giving the greater honor to the parts that lacked it,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">so that there may be no division in the body, but that the members may have the same care for one another.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And if one member suffers, all the members suffer with it; if one member is honored, all the members rejoice with it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Now you are the body of Christ, and individually members of it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And God has appointed in the church first apostles, second prophets, third teachers, then workers of miracles, then those having gifts of healings, helps, administrations, and those speaking in various kinds of tongues.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Are all apostles? Are all prophets? Are all teachers? Do all work miracles?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Do all have gifts of healing? Do all speak with tongues? Do all interpret?</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">If I speak in the tongues of men and of angels, but have not love, I am a noisy gong or a clanging cymbal.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">If I give all I have to the poor, and if I surrender my body to be burned, but have not love, I gain nothing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Love is patient, love is kind. It is not jealous or boastful, it is not arrogant</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">or rude, it does not seek its own, it is not provoked, it keeps no record of wrongs,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">it does not rejoice in evil, but rejoices with the truth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Love bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Love never fails; but where there are prophecies, they will cease; where there are tongues, they will be stilled; where there is knowledge, it will pass away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">For we know in part and we prophesy in part;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">but when the perfect comes, the partial will pass away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">When I was a child, I spoke like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child; when I became a man, I put childish ways behind me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">For now we see in a mirror dimly, but then face to face. Now I know in part, but then I shall know fullyeven as I have been fully known.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">So now faith, hope, love abide, these three; but the greatest of these is love.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="14">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Pursue love, and earnestly desire the spiritual gifts, especially that you may prophesy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">For one who speaks in a tongue does not speak to men but to God; for no one understands him, but in his spirit he speaks mysteries.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">But everyone who prophesies speaks to men for their edification and encouragement and comfort.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">He who speaks in a tongue edifies himself, but he who prophesies edifies the church.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Now I want you all to speak in tongues, but even more that you would prophesy. He who prophesies is greater than he who speaks in tongues, unless some one interprets, so that the church may be edified.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But now, brethren, if I come to you speaking in tongues, what will I profit you unless I bring you some revelation or knowledge or prophecy or teaching?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">If even lifeless things, such as the flute or the harp, do not give a distinction in the notes, how will any one know what is played?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And if the bugle gives an indistinct sound, who will get ready for battle?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">So it is with you, unless you utter by the tongue speech that is intelligible, how will anyone know what is spoken? For you will be speaking into the air.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Undoubtedly there are many languages in the world, and none of them is without meaning.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">If then I do not know the meaning of the language, I will be a foreigner to the one who is speaking, and the speaker will be a foreigner to me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">So it is with you; since you are eager for spiritual gifts, strive to excel in building up the church.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Therefore, he who speaks in a tongue should pray that he may interpret.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">For if I pray in a tongue, my spirit prays, but my mind is unfruitful.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">What am I to do? I will pray with the spirit and I will pray with the mind also; I will sing with the spirit and I will sing with the mind also.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Otherwise, if you bless with the spirit, how can any one in the position of an outsider say the »Amen« to your thanksgiving, since he does not know what you are saying?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">For you may be giving thanks well enough, but the other man is not edified.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">I thank God that I speak in tongues more than you all;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">but in the church I would rather speak five words with my mind, to instruct others, than ten thousand words in a tongue.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Brethren, do not be children in your thinking; be infants in evil, but in thinking be mature.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">In the law it is written, <STYLE css="display:block;text-indent:5mm">»By men of strange tongues</STYLE><STYLE css="display:block;text-indent:10mm">and by the lips of foreigners</STYLE><STYLE css="display:block;text-indent:5mm">will I speak to this people,</STYLE><STYLE css="display:block;text-indent:10mm">and even then they will not listen to me,</STYLE><STYLE css="display:block;text-indent:5mm">says the Lord.«</STYLE></VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Tongues, then, are a sign, not for believers but for unbelievers; but prophecy is for believers, not for unbelievers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Therefore if the whole church assembles together and all speak in tongues, and outsiders or unbelievers enter, will they not say that you are mad?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">But if all prophesy, and an unbeliever or an outsider enters, he is convicted by all, he is called to account by all;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">the secrets of his heart are disclosed; and so, he will fall on his face, and worship God, declaring that God is really among you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">What is the outcome then, brethren? When you come together, each one has a hymn, or a teaching, or a revelation, or a tongue, or an interpretation. Let all things be done for edification.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">If anyone speaks in a tongue, it should be by two or at the most three, and each in turn; and one must interpret.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">But if there is no interpreter, he must keep silent in the church; and let him speak to himself and to God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Let two or three prophets speak, and let the others weigh what is said.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">But if a revelation is made to another who is sitting, the first one must keep silent.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">For you can all prophesy one by one, so that all may learn and all be encouraged;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">and the spirits of prophets are subject to prophets.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">For God is not a God of confusion but of peace. <STYLE css="display:block;text-indent:5mm">As in all the churches of the saints,</STYLE></VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">the women should keep silent in the churches. For they are not permitted to speak, but should be submissive, as even the law says.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">If they desire to learn anything, let them ask their own husbands at home; for it is shameful for a woman to speak in church.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">Did the word of God originate with you? Or are you the only people it has reached?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">If anyone thinks he is a prophet or spiritual, let him acknowledge that what I am writing to you is the Lord's command.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">But if anyone does not recognize this, he is not recognized.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">Therefore, my brethren, desire earnestly to prophesy, and do not forbid speaking in tongues.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="14">if Christ has not been raised, then our preaching is in vain and so is your faith.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">More than that, we are even found to be false witnesses of God, because we testified against God that he raised Christ, whom he did not raise, if in fact the dead are not raised.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="17">And if Christ has not been raised, your faith is futile; you are still in your sins.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="19">If for this life only we have hoped in Christ, we are of all men most to be pitied.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">But Christ has indeed been raised from the dead, the first fruits of those who have fallen asleep.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">For since by a man came death, by a man came also the resurrection of the dead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">For as in Adam all die, so also in Christ all will be made alive.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="34">Come back to your senses as you ought, and stop sinning; for some have no knowledge of God. I say this to your shame.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">But someone will ask, »How are the dead raised? With what kind of body do they come?«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">You foolish man! What you sow does not come to life unless it dies.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">And that which you sow, you do not sow the body which is to be, but a bare grain, perhaps of wheat or of something else.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">But God gives it a body as he has determined, and to each kind of seed he gives its own body.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">For not all flesh is the same flesh, but there is one kind of flesh of men, another flesh of animals, another of birds, and another of fish.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">There are also heavenly bodies and there are earthly bodies; but the glory of the heavenly is one, and the glory of the earthly is another.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">There is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars; for star differs from star in glory.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">So is it with the resurrection of the dead. It is sown a perishable body, it is raised imperishable;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">it is sown in dishonor, it is raised in glory; it is sown in weakness, it is raised in power;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">it is sown a natural body, it is raised a spiritual body. If there is a natural body, there is also a spiritual body.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">So it is written, »The first man Adam became a living being«; the last Adam became a life-giving spirit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">However, the spiritual is not first, but the natural; and then the spiritual.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">The first man was from the earth, of dust; the second man is from heaven.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="49">Just as we have borne the image of the man of dust, we shall also bear the image of the man of heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">Now I tell you this, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; nor does the perishable inherit the imperishable.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="53">For this perishable must put on the imperishable, and this mortal must put on immortality.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="54">When the perishable puts on the imperishable, and the mortal puts on immortality, then will come to pass the saying that is written: <STYLE css="display:block;text-indent:5mm">»Death is swallowed up in victory.«</STYLE></VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and Timothy our brother, to the church of God which is at Corinth, with all the saints who are throughout Achaia:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies and the God of all comfort,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">who comforts us in all our affliction, so that we may be able to comfort those who are in any affliction, with the comfort with which we ourselves are comforted by God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">For just as the sufferings of Christ flow over into our lives, so also through Christ our comfort overflows.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">If we are afflicted, it is for your comfort and salvation; and if we are comforted, it is for your comfort, which is effective in the patient enduring of the same sufferings that we suffer.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And our hope for you is firm, because we know that just as you share in our sufferings, so also you share in our comfort.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">For we do not want you to be ignorant, brethren, of our affliction which came to us in Asia: that we were burdened beyond measure, above strength, so that we despaired even of life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Indeed, we felt that we had received the sentence of death. But this happened that we might not rely on ourselves but on God, who raises the dead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">He delivered us from so deadly a peril, and he will deliver us; on him we have set our hope that he will deliver us again.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">You also must help us by your prayers, so that many will give thanks on our behalf for the blessing granted us in answer to the prayers of many.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">For our boast is this: the testimony of our conscience, that with holiness and godly sincerity, not in worldly wisdom but in the grace of God, we have conducted ourselves in the world, and still more toward you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">For we write you nothing but what you can read and understand; and I hope you will understand fully,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">as you have understood us in part, that you can be proud of us just as we can be of you, in the day of the Lord Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Because I was sure of this, I wanted to come to you first, so that you might have a double benefit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">I planned to visit you on my way to Macedonia and to come back to you from Macedonia, and then to have you send me on my way to Judea.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">When I was planning this, did I do it lightly? Or do I make my plans in a fleshly manner so that in the same breath I say, »Yes, Yes« and »No, No«?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">But as surely as God is faithful, our word to you has not been Yes and No.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">For the Son of God, Christ Jesus, who was preached among you by usby me and Silvanus and Timothywas not Yes and No, but in him it has always been Yes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">For as many as are the promises of God, in him they are Yes. And so through him we speak our Amen to the glory of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Now it is God who establishes us with you in Christ, and has anointed us;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">he has put his seal on us and given us his Spirit in our hearts as a guarantee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">But I call God as my witness that it was in order to spare you that I did not return to Corinth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Not that we lord it over your faith; but we work with you for your joy, for you stand firm in your faith.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="2">
      <VERS vnumber="1">So I made up my mind that I would not make another painful visit to you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">For if I cause you pain, who is there to make me glad but the one whom I have pained?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And I wrote as I did, so that when I came I might not suffer pain from those who should have made me rejoice, for I had confidence in all of you, that my joy would be the joy of you all.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">For I wrote you out of much affliction and anguish of heart and with many tears, not to cause you pain but to let you know the abundant love that I have for you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">But if any one has caused pain, he has caused it not to me, but in some measurenot to put it too severelyto all of you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Sufficient for such a one is this punishment which was inflicted by the majority,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">so you should rather turn to forgive and comfort him, so that he will not be overwhelmed by excessive sorrow.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">I urge you, therefore, to reaffirm your love for him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">For this is why I wrote, that I might test you and know whether you are obedient in everything.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Any one whom you forgive, I also forgive. What I have forgiven, if I have forgiven anything, has been for your sake in the presence of Christ,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">in order that Satan might gain no advantage over us; for we are not ignorant of his schemes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Now when I came to Troas to preach the gospel of Christ and when a door was opened for me in the Lord,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">I still had no rest in my mind, because I did not find my brother Titus there. So I took my leave of them and went on to Macedonia.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">But thanks be to God, who in Christ always leads us in triumph, and through us spreads the fragrance of the knowledge of him everywhere.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">For we are the aroma of Christ to God among those who are being saved and among those who are perishing,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">to the one a fragrance from death to death, to the other a fragrance from life to life. And who is sufficient for these things?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">For we are not, like so many, peddling the word of God; but as men of sincerity, as from God, in the sight of God we speak in Christ.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="3">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Are we beginning to commend ourselves again? Or do we need, as some do, letters of recommendation to you, or from you?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">You yourselves are our letter, written in our hearts, known and read by all men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">You show that you are a letter from Christ, delivered by us, written not with ink but with the Spirit of the living God, not on tablets of stone but on tablets of carnal hearts.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Such is the confidence that we have through Christ toward God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Not that we are competent of ourselves to claim anything as coming from ourselves; but our competence is from God,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">who has made us competent as ministers of a new covenant, not of the letter but of the Spirit; for the letter kills, but the Spirit gives life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Now if the ministry that brought death, which was engraved in letters on stone, came with glory, so that the Israelites could not look steadily at the face of Moses because of its glory, fading though it was,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">will not the ministry of the Spirit be even more glorious?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">For if the ministry of condemnation has glory, much more does the ministry of righteousness exceed it in glory.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">For indeed what had glory, in this case has no glory because of the glory that surpasses it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">For if what was fading away came with glory, much more is the glory of that which lasts.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Therefore, since we have such a hope, we are very bold.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">We are not like Moses, who would put a veil over his face to keep the Israelites from gazing at the end of the radiance that was fading away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">But their minds were hardened; for to this day, when they read the old covenant, the same veil remains unlifted, because only in Christ is it removed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Even to this day when Moses is read, a veil lies over their hearts.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">But whenever a person turns to the Lord, the veil is taken away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Now the Lord is the Spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And we all, with unveiled face, beholding the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into his likeness from one degree of glory to another, for this comes from the Lord who is the Spirit.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="4">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Therefore, since we have this ministry, as we have received mercy, we do not lose heart.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">But we have renounced secret and shameful ways; we do not use deception, nor do we distort the word of God. On the contrary, by setting forth the truth plainly we commend ourselves to every man's conscience in the sight of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And even if our gospel is veiled, it is veiled to those who are perishing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">In their case the god of this world has blinded the minds of the unbelievers, so that they might not see the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">For we do not preach ourselves, but Jesus Christ as Lord, and ourselves as your servants for Jesus' sake.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">For it is the God who said, »Let light shine out of darkness,« who has shone in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, to show that this all-surpassing power is from God and not from us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">We are hard pressed on every side, but not crushed; perplexed, but not in despair;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">persecuted, but not forsaken; struck down, but not destroyed;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">always carrying about in the body the death of Jesus, so that the life of Jesus also may be manifested in our body.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">For we who live are always being given up to death for Jesus' sake, so that the life of Jesus may be manifested in our mortal flesh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">So then death is at work in us, but life in you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Since we have the same spirit of faith, according to what is written, »I believed and therefore I spoke,« we also believe and therefore speak,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">knowing that he who raised the Lord Jesus will raise us also with Jesus and bring us with you into his presence.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">For all this is for your benefit, so that the grace that is reaching more and more people may cause thanksgiving to overflow to the glory of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Therefore we do not lose heart. Though our outer nature is wasting away, yet our inner nature is being renewed day by day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">For our light and momentary affliction is producing for us an eternal weight of glory far beyond all comparison,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">while we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are unseen; for the things which are seen are temporary, but the things which are unseen are eternal.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="5">
      <VERS vnumber="1">For we know that if the earthly tent we live in is destroyed, we have a building from God, a house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Here indeed we groan, longing to be clothed with our heavenly dwelling,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">so that when we are clothed, we will not be found naked.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">For while we are in this tent, we groan and are burdened, because we do not wish to be unclothed, but to be further clothed, so that what is mortal may be swallowed up by life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Now he who has prepared us for this very thing is God, who also has given us the Spirit as a guarantee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Therefore we are always of good courage; and we know that while we are at home in the body we are away from the Lord,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">for we walk by faith, not by sight.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">We are confident, I say, and would rather be away from the body and at home with the Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">So whether we are at home or away, we make it our aim to please him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, that each one may receive the things done in the body, according to what he has done, whether good or bad.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Therefore, knowing the fear of the Lord, we persuade men; but what we are is known to God, and I hope it is known also to your conscience.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">We are not again commending ourselves to you, but are giving you an occasion to be proud of us, so that you may have an answer for those who take pride in appearance and not in heart.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">For if we are beside ourselves, it is for God; if we are in our right mind, it is for you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">For the love of Christ controls us, because we are convinced that one has died for all; therefore all have died.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And he died for all, that those who live should no longer live for themselves but for him who died for them and was raised again.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">From now on, therefore, we regard no one from a fleshly point of view; even though we once regarded Christ from a fleshly point of view, we regard him thus no longer.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Therefore, if any one is in Christ, he is a new creation; the old has passed away, behold, the new has come.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">All this is from God, who through Christ reconciled us to himself and gave us the ministry of reconciliation;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">that is, God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself, not counting their trespasses against them, and he has committed to us the message of reconciliation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">We are therefore ambassadors for Christ, as though God were making his appeal through us. We beg you on behalf of Christ, be reconciled to God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">For our sake he made him to be sin who knew no sin, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Working together with him, then, we urge you not to receive the grace of God in vain.</VERS>

At every point you have proved yourselves to be innocent in this matter.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">So although I wrote to you, it was not on account of the one who did the wrong, nor on account of the one who suffered the wrong, but in order that your zeal for us might be revealed to you in the sight of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Therefore we are comforted. <STYLE css="display:block;text-indent:5mm">And besides our own comfort, we rejoiced still more at the joy of Titus, because his spirit has been refreshed by you all.</STYLE></VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">For if I have boasted to him about you, I was not put to shame; but just as everything we said to you was true, so our boasting before Titus has proved true.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And his affection goes out all the more to you, as he remembers the obedience of you all, how you received him with fear and trembling.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">I rejoice, because I have perfect confidence in you.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Now, brethren, we want you to know about the grace of God which has been given in the churches of Macedonia,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">for in a severe test of affliction, their abundance of joy and their extreme poverty have overflowed in the wealth of their liberality.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">For I testify that according to their ability, and even beyond their ability, they gave of their own free will,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">urgently pleading with us for the privilege of sharing in the relief of the saints.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And they did not do as we expected, but they first gave themselves to the Lord and to us by the will of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">So we urged Titus that as he had previously made a beginning, he would also complete in you this work of grace.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">But as you excel in everythingin faith, in utterance, in knowledge, in all earnestness, and in your love for ussee that you excel in this work of grace also.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">I am not speaking this as a command, but I want to test the sincerity of your love by comparing it with the earnestness of others.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, so that through his poverty you might become rich.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And in this matter I give my advice: it is best for you now to complete what a year ago you began not only to do but to desire.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Now finish the work, so that your readiness to do it may be matched by your completion of it, according to your means.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">For if the readiness is there, it is acceptable according to what a man has, not according to what he does not have.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">For I do not mean that others should be eased and you burdened;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">but at the present time your abundance should supply their need, so that their abundance may supply your need, that there may be equality.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">As it is written, <STYLE css="display:block;text-indent:5mm">»He who gathered much had nothing left over,</STYLE><STYLE css="display:block;text-indent:10mm">and he who gathered little had no lack.«</STYLE></VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">But thanks be to God who puts the same earnest care for you into the heart of Titus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">For he not only accepted our appeal, but being himself very earnest he is going to you of his own accord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And we are sending along with him the brother who is praised by all the churches for his preaching of the gospel;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">and not only that, but he has been appointed by the churches to travel with us in this gracious work which we are carrying on, for the glory of the Lord himself and to show our good will.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">We intend that no one should blame us about this liberal gift which we are administering,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">for we have regard for what is honorable, not only in the sight of the Lord, but also in the sight of men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And with them we are sending our brother whom we have often proved diligent in many matters, but who is now more diligent than ever because of his great confidence in you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">As for Titus, he is my partner and fellow worker among you; and as for our brethren, they are messengers of the churches, a glory to Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Therefore openly before the churches, show these men the proof of your love and the reason for our boasting about you.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="9">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now it is superfluous for me to write to you about the offering for the saints,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">for I know your readiness, of which I boast about you to the Macedonians, saying that Achaia has been ready since last year; and your zeal has stirred up most of them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">But I am sending the brethren so that our boasting about you may not prove vain in this case, so that you may be ready, as I said you would be;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">lest if any Macedonians come with me and find you unprepared, wenot to say anything about youwould be ashamed of having been so confident.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">So I thought it necessary to urge the brethren to go on to you before me, and arrange in advance for this gift you have promised, so that it may be ready not as an exaction but as a willing gift.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">The point is this: he who sows sparingly will also reap sparingly, and he who sows bountifully will also reap bountifully.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Each one must give just as he has purposed in his heart, not reluctantly or under compulsion, for God loves a cheerful giver.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And God is able to make all grace abound toward you, so that you, always having all sufficiency in everything, may have an abundance for every good work.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">As it is written, <STYLE css="display:block;text-indent:5mm">»He has scattered abroad, he gives to the poor;</STYLE><STYLE css="display:block;text-indent:10mm">his righteousness endures forever.«</STYLE></VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Now he who supplies seed to the sower and bread for food will also supply and increase your store of seed and will multiply the harvest of your righteousness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">You will be enriched in every way for great generosity, which through us will produce thanksgiving to God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">For the ministry of this service is not only fully supplying the needs of the saints, but is also overflowing through many thanksgivings to God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Because of the test of this service, you will glorify God by your obedience in your confession of the gospel of Christ, and by the generosity of your contribution for them and for all others;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">while they long for you and pray for you, because of the surpassing grace of God in you.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">I, Paul, myself urge you, by the meekness and gentleness of ChristI who am humble when face to face with you, but bold to you when I am away!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">I beg you that when I am present I may not have to be bold with that confidence by which I intend to be bold against some, who think of us as if we walked according to the flesh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">For though we live in the flesh, we do not wage war as the flesh does.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">For the weapons of our warfare are not the weapons of the world, but they have divine power to destroy strongholds.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">We demolish arguments and every pretension that sets itself up against the knowledge of God, and we take captive every thought to make it obedient to Christ,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">and we are ready to punish every disobedience, whenever your obedience is complete.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">You look at things as they are outwardly. If anyone is confident in himself that he is Christ's, let him consider this again within himself, that just as he is Christs, so also are we.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">For even if I boast somewhat further about our authority, which the Lord gave for building you up and not for destroying you, I shall not be put to shame.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">I do not wish to seem as if I would terrify you by my letters.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">For they say, »His letters are weighty and strong, but his personal presence is weak, and his speech of no account.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Let such people realize that what we are in our letters when we are absent, we will be in our actions when we are present.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">For we do not dare to class or compare ourselves with some of those who commend themselves. But when they measure themselves by themselves, and compare themselves with themselves, they are without understanding.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">But we will not boast beyond proper limits, but will confine our boasting to the field God has apportioned to us, a field that reaches even to you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">For we are not overextending ourselves, as if we did not reach to you; we were the first to come even as far as you with the gospel of Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">We do not go beyond limits by boasting in other mens labors, but our hope is that as your faith grows, our sphere among you may be greatly enlarged,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">so that we can preach the gospel in the regions beyond you. For we do not want to boast of work already done in another man's territory.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">But, »Let him who boasts boast in the Lord.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">For it is not he who commends himself that is approved, but he whom the Lord commends.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">I wish that you would bear with me in a little foolishness; but indeed you are bearing with me.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">But I am afraid that just as the serpent deceived Eve by his cunning, your minds may somehow be led astray from your sincere and pure devotion to Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">For if someone comes to you and preaches a Jesus other than the one we preached, or if you receive a different spirit from the one you received, or a different gospel from the one you accepted, you put up with it easily enough.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">I think that I am not in the least inferior to these super-apostles.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But even if I am unskilled in speech, I am not in knowledge; in every way we have made this plain to you in all things.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="9">And when I was with you and needed something, I was not a burden to anyone, for the brethren who came from Macedonia supplied what I needed. I have kept myself from being a burden to you in any way, and will continue to do so.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">As the truth of Christ is in me, this boasting of mine will not be stopped in the regions of Achaia.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Why? Because I do not love you? God knows I do!</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="13">For such men are false apostles, deceitful workmen, disguising themselves as apostles of Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And no wonder, for even Satan disguises himself as an angel of light.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="16">I repeat, let no one think me foolish; but even if you do, receive me as a fool, so that I too may boast a little.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">What I am saying I am not saying as the Lord would, but as a fool, in this confidence of boasting.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Since many boast according to the flesh, I too will boast.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">For you put up with fools gladly, being so wise yourselves!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">For you put up with anyone if he makes slaves of you, or preys upon you, or takes advantage of you, or exalts himself, or strikes you in the face.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">To my shame, I must say that we were too weak for that! But whatever anyone else dares to boast aboutI am speaking as a foolI also dare to boast about.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="6">Though if I should boast, I will not be a fool, for I will be speaking the truth. But I refrain from it, so that no one may think more of me than he sees in me or hears from me.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="13">For in what respect were you inferior to the rest of the churches, except that I myself did not become a burden to you? Forgive me this wrong!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Here for the third time I am ready to come to you. And I will not be a burden to you, for I seek not what is yours but you; for children ought not to lay up for their parents, but parents for their children.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="20">I have been crucified with Christ; it is no longer I who live, but Christ who lives in me; and the life I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">I do not nullify the grace of God, for if righteousness comes through the Law, then Christ died for nothing.«</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="3">
      <VERS vnumber="1">You foolish Galatians! Who has bewitched you, before whose eyes Jesus Christ was publicly portrayed as crucified?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">This is the only thing I want to find out from you: did you receive the Spirit by the works of the Law, or by hearing with faith?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Are you so foolish? Having begun with the Spirit, are you now being perfected by the flesh?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Did you suffer so many things in vainif it really was in vain?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Does he who supplies the Spirit to you and works miracles among you do so by works of the law, or by hearing with faith?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Even so Abraham »believed God, and it was reckoned to him as righteousness.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Therefore, be sure that it is those who are of faith who are sons of Abraham.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And the Scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles by faith, preached the gospel beforehand to Abraham, saying, »In you will all the nations be blessed.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">So then those who are of faith are blessed with Abraham, the man of faith.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">For all who rely on works of the law are under a curse; for it is written, »Cursed is everyone who does not abide by all things written in the book of the law, to do them.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Now that no one is justified by the Law before God is evident; for, »The righteous man shall live by faith.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">But the Law is not of faith; on the contrary, »He who does them shall live by them.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Christ redeemed us from the curse of the Law, having become a curse for usfor it is written, »Cursed is everyone who hangs on a tree«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">in order that in Christ Jesus the blessing of Abraham might come to the Gentiles, so that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">To give a human example, brethren: even though it is only a man's covenant, yet when it has been ratified, no one sets it aside or adds conditions to it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Now the promises were spoken to Abraham and to his seed. He does not say, »And to seeds,« as referring to many, but rather to one, »And to your seed,« that is, Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">What I mean is this: the Law, which came four hundred and thirty years later, does not invalidate a covenant previously ratified by God, so as to nullify the promise.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">For if the inheritance is based on the law, it is no longer based on a promise; but God gave it to Abraham by a promise.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Why the Law then? It was added because of transgressions, having been ordained through angels by the agency of a mediator, until the seed would come to whom the promise had been made.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Now a mediator does not represent just one party; but God is one.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Is the law then opposed to the promises of God? Certainly not! For if a law had been given which could impart life, then righteousness would indeed have come by the law.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">But the Scripture has bound everyone under sin, so that that what was promised by faith in Jesus Christ might be given to those who believe.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Now before faith came, we were bound under the law, kept under restraint until faith should be revealed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">So the law was our tutor to lead us to Christ, that we might be justified by faith.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">But now that faith has come, we are no longer under a tutor.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">For you are all sons of God, through faith in Christ Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">For all of you who were baptized into Christ have clothed yourselves with Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free, there is neither male nor female; for you are all one in Christ Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And if you belong to Christ, then you are Abraham's offspring, heirs according to promise.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="4">
      <VERS vnumber="1">I mean that the heir, as long as he is a child, is no different from a slave, although he is the owner of all the estate;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">but he is under guardians and trustees until the date set by the father.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">So also, when we were children, we were in slavery under the elemental things of the world.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">But when the time had fully come, God sent forth his Son, born of a woman, born under the law,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">to redeem those who were under the law, so that we might receive adoption as sons.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Because you are sons, God has sent the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, crying, »Abba! Father!«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">So you are no longer a slave, but a son; and if a son, then an heir through God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Formerly, when you did not know God, you were slaves to those which by nature are no gods.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">But now that you have come to know God, or rather to be known by God, how is it that you turn back again to the weak and worthless elemental things? Do you desire to be enslaved all over again?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">You observe days and months and seasons and years!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">I fear for you, that perhaps I have labored over you in vain.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Brethren, I beg you, become as I am, for I also have become as you are. You have done me no wrong;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">you know it was because of an illness in the flesh that I preached the gospel to you at first;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">and though my fleshly condition was a trial to you, you did not despise or scorn me, but you received me as an angel of God, as Christ Jesus himself.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">What has become of the satisfaction you felt? For I bear you witness that, if possible, you would have plucked out your eyes and given them to me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Have I now become your enemy by telling you the truth?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">They seek you, but for no good purpose; they want to shut you out, so that you may seek them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">But it is always good to seek a good purpose, and not only when I am present with you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">My children, with whom I am again in labor until Christ is formed in you</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">I could wish to be present with you now and to change my tone, for I am perplexed about you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Tell me, you who want to be under law, do you not listen to the law?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">For it is written that Abraham had two sons, one by the slave and one by the free woman.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">But the son by the slave was born according to the flesh, and the son by the free woman through the promise.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">This is allegorically speaking, for these women are two covenants. One is from Mount Sinai bearing children who are to be slaves; she is Hagar.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Now this Hagar is Mount Sinai in Arabia and corresponds to the present Jerusalem, for she is in slavery with her children.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">But the Jerusalem above is free, and she is our mother.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">For it is written, <STYLE css="display:block;text-indent:5mm">»Rejoice, O barren woman who does not bear;</STYLE><STYLE css="display:block;text-indent:10mm">break forth and shout, you who are not in labor;</STYLE><STYLE css="display:block;text-indent:5mm">for the children of the desolate are more numerous</STYLE><STYLE css="display:block;text-indent:10mm">than the children of her who has a husband.«</STYLE></VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Now you, brethren, like Isaac, are children of promise.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">But as at that time he who was born according to the flesh persecuted him who was born according to the Spirit, so it is now.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">But what does the scripture say? »Cast out the slave and her son, for the son of the slave shall not inherit with the son of the free woman.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">So then, brethren, we are not children of the slave, but of the free woman.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="5">
      <VERS vnumber="1">It was for freedom that Christ has set us free; therefore keep standing firm and do not be subject again to a yoke of slavery.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">I testify again to every man who receives circumcision, that he is under obligation to keep the whole Law.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">You have been severed from Christ, you who are seeking to be justified by law; you have fallen away from grace.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">For through the Spirit, by faith, we wait for the hope of righteousness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision is of any avail, but faith working through love.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">You were running well; who hindered you from obeying the truth?</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="12">I wish that those who are troubling you would mutilate themselves!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">For you were called to freedom, brethren; only do not use your freedom as an opportunity for the flesh, but through love serve one another.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">For the whole law is fulfilled in one word, »You shall love your neighbor as yourself.«</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="16">But I say, walk by the Spirit, and you will not gratify the desires of the flesh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">For the desires of the flesh are against the Spirit, and the desires of the Spirit are against the flesh; for these are opposed to each other, so that you may not do what you would.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the Law.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Now the deeds of the flesh are obvious: immorality, impurity, lewdness,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">idolatry, sorcery, hatred, strife, jealousy, outbursts of anger, disputes, dissensions, factions,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">envy, drunkenness, carousing, and the like. I warn you, as I warned you before, that those who do such things will not inherit the kingdom of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">gentleness, self-control; against such things there is no law.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="2">grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places in Christ,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">just as he chose us in him before the foundation of the world, that we would be holy and blameless before him. In love</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">he predestined us to be adopted as his sons through Jesus Christ, according to the good pleasure of his will,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">to the praise of his glorious grace, which he freely bestowed on us in the Beloved.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">In him we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of our trespasses, according to the riches of his grace</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">which he lavished on us. In all wisdom and insight</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">he made known to us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure, which he purposed in Christ,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">as a plan for the fullness of the times, to unite all things in Christ, things in heaven and things on earth. In him</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">also we have obtained an inheritance, having been predestined according to the purpose of him who works all things after the counsel of his will,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">in order that we, who were the first to hope in Christ, would be for the praise of his glory.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">In him, you also have heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation. Having also believed, you were sealed in him with the promised Holy Spirit,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">who is a deposit guaranteeing our inheritance, until the redemption of those who are God's possessionto the praise of his glory.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">For this reason, ever since I heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus and your love for all the saints,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">I do not cease giving thanks for you, remembering you in my prayers,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give to you a spirit of wisdom and of revelation in the knowledge of him.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="13">But now in Christ Jesus you who once were far off have been brought near in the blood of Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">For he himself is our peace, who has made us both one and has broken down the barrier, the dividing wall of hostility,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">by abolishing in his flesh the hostility, which is the Law of commandments and ordinances, so that he might create in himself one new man out of the two, thus making peace,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="17">And he came and preached peace to you who were far away, and peace to those who were near;</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">I thank my God in all my remembrance of you,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="6">For I am confident of this, that he who began a good work in you will carry it on to completion until the day of Christ Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">For it is only right for me to feel this way about you all, because I have you in my heart, since both in my imprisonment and in the defense and confirmation of the gospel, you all are partakers of grace with me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">For God is my witness, how I long for you all with the affection of Christ Jesus.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="14">and that most of the brethren, trusting in the Lord because of my imprisonment, have been encouraged to speak the word of God without fear.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="16">The latter do it out of love, knowing that I am put here for the defense of the gospel;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">the former proclaim Christ out of selfish ambition, not sincerely, but thinking to cause me distress in my imprisonment.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">What then? Only that in every way, whether in pretense or in truth, Christ is proclaimed; and in this I rejoice. Yes, and I will rejoice,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="8">And being found in appearance as a man, he humbled himself and became obedient to deatheven death on a cross.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="29">So receive him in the Lord with all joy; and honor men like him,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">remembering before our God and Father your work of faith and labor of love and steadfastness of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">For we know, brethren beloved by God, that he has chosen you;</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="6">You became imitators of us and of the Lord, for you received the word in much affliction, with the joy of the Holy Spirit;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">so that you became an example to all the believers in Macedonia and in Achaia.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">For not only has the word of the Lord sounded forth from you in Macedonia and Achaia, but your faith in God has gone forth everywhere, so that we have no need to say anything.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">For they themselves report about us what kind of a reception we had with you, and how you turned to God from idols to serve a living and true God,</VERS>

    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="2">
      <VERS vnumber="1">For you yourselves know, brethren, that our visit to you was not in vain;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">but after we had already suffered and been shamefully treated in Philippi, as you know, we had the boldness in our God to speak to you the gospel of God in the face of great opposition.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">For our appeal does not spring from error or impurity, nor is it made with deceit;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">but just as we have been approved by God to be entrusted with the gospel, so we speak, not to please men, but to please God who tests our hearts.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">For, as you know, we never used flattery nor a pretext for greedGod is witness</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="8">Having so fond an affection for you, we were ready to share with you not only the gospel of God but also our own lives, because you had become very dear to us.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="10">You are witnesses, and God also, how holy and righteous and blameless we behaved toward you believers;</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="13">And we also thank God constantly for this, that when you received the word of God which you heard from us, you accepted it not as the word of men but as what it really is, the word of God, which is at work in you who believe.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">For you, brethren, became imitators of the churches of God in Christ Jesus which are in Judea, for you suffered the same things from your own countrymen as they did from the Jews,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="5">For this reason, when I could endure it no longer, I also sent to find out about your faith, for fear that the tempter might have tempted you, and our labor would be in vain.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">For this is the will of God, your sanctification: that is, that you should abstain from sexual immorality;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">that each one of you know how to take his own spouse for himself in holiness and honor,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">not in the passion of lust like the heathen, who do not know God;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">and that no man transgress and wrong his brother in this matter because the Lord is the avenger in all these things, just as we also told you before and solemnly warned you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">For God has not called us to impurity, but to holiness.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="11">Make it your ambition to lead a quiet life, to mind your own business and to work with your hands, just as we told you,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">so that your daily life may win the respect of outsiders and so that you will not be dependent on anyone.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">But we do not want you to be ignorant, brethren, about those who are asleep, so that you will not grieve as do the rest who have no hope.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so God will bring with him those who have fallen asleep in Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">For this we declare to you by the word of the Lord, that we who are alive, who are left until the coming of the Lord, will not precede those who have fallen asleep.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">For the Lord himself will descend from heaven, with a loud command, with the voice of the archangel and with the trumpet call of God, and the dead in Christ will rise first.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Then we who are alive and are left will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air, and so we shall always be with the Lord.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="5">For you are all sons of light and sons of the day; we are not of the night or of darkness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">So then let us not sleep, as others do, but let us be alert and sober.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">For those who sleep, sleep at night; and those who get drunk, get drunk at night.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="14">Since therefore the children share in flesh and blood, he himself likewise partook of the same nature, that through death he might destroy him who has the power of death, that is, the devil,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">and might free those who through fear of death were subject to slavery all their lives.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">For surely it is not with angels that he is concerned, but with the descendants of Abraham.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="11">Therefore let us be diligent to enter that rest, so that no one will fall by following the same example of disobedience.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">For the word of God is living and active, sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing even to the division of soul and spirit, of joints and marrow, and discerning the thoughts and intentions of the heart.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And there is no creature hidden from his sight, but all things are open and laid bare to the eyes of him with whom we have to do.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Since then we have a great high priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus, the Son of God, let us hold fast our confession.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">For we do not have a high priest who is unable to sympathize with our weaknesses, but one who in every respect has been tempted as we are, yet without sin.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Let us then with confidence draw near to the throne of grace, that we may receive mercy and find grace to help in time of need.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="5">
      <VERS vnumber="1">For every high priest chosen from among men is appointed to act on behalf of men in relation to God, to offer gifts and sacrifices for sins.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">He can deal gently with those who are ignorant and going astray, since he himself is beset with weakness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Because of this he has to offer sacrifices for his own sins, as well as for the sins of the people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And no one takes the honor upon himself, but he is called by God, just as Aaron was.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">So also Christ did not exalt himself to become a high priest, but it was he who said to him, <STYLE css="display:block;text-indent:5mm">»You are my son,</STYLE><STYLE css="display:block;text-indent:10mm">today I have begotten you«;</STYLE></VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">as he says also in another place, <STYLE css="display:block;text-indent:5mm">»You are a priest forever,</STYLE><STYLE css="display:block;text-indent:10mm">after the order of Melchizedek.«</STYLE></VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">In the days of his flesh, Jesus offered up prayers and supplications, with loud cries and tears, to the one who was able to save him from death, and he was heard because of his godly fear.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Although he was a Son, he learned obedience from what he suffered;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">and, once made perfect, he became the source of eternal salvation for all who obey him,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">being designated by God as a high priest according to the order of Melchizedek.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">About this we have much to say which is hard to explain, since you have become dull of hearing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">For though by this time you ought to be teachers, you need someone to teach you again the first principles of God's word. You need milk, not solid food;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">for every one who lives on milk is unskilled in the word of righteousness, for he is a babe.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">But solid food is for the mature, for those who have their sense trained by practice to distinguish good from evil.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="6">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Therefore let us leave the elementary teachings about Christ and go on to maturity, not laying again a foundation of repentance from dead works, and of faith toward God,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">with instruction about baptisms, the laying on of hands, the resurrection of the dead, and eternal judgment.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And this we will do, if God permits.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">For it is impossible for those who have once been enlightened, who have tasted the heavenly gift, and have become partakers of the Holy Spirit,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">and have tasted the goodness of the word of God and the powers of the age to come,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">and then have fallen away, to renew them again to repentance, since they crucify again for themselves the Son of God, and put him to an open shame.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">For land which drinks the rain that often falls upon it, and brings forth vegetation useful to those for whose sake it is cultivated, receives a blessing from God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">But if it bears thorns and thistles, it is worthless and near to being cursed; its end is to be burned.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Even though we speak like this, beloved, we are confident of better things in your case, things that accompany salvation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">For God is not so unjust as to forget your work and the love which you have shown for his sake in serving the saints, as you still do.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And we desire each one of you to show the same diligence in realizing the full assurance of hope until the end,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">so that you may not be sluggish, but imitators of those who through faith and patience inherit the promises.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">For when God made a promise to Abraham, since he had no one greater by whom to swear, he swore by himself,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">saying, »I will surely bless you and multiply you.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And so Abraham, having patiently endured, obtained the promise.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Men swear by one greater than themselves, and in all their disputes the oath is final for confirmation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">So when God desired to show more convincingly to the heirs of the promise the unchangeable character of his purpose, he interposed with an oath,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">so that, by two unchangeable things in which it is impossible for God to lie, we who have taken refuge would have strong encouragement to take hold of the hope set before us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">We have this as a sure and steadfast anchor of the soul, a hope that enters into the inner sanctuary behind the curtain,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">where Jesus has entered as a forerunner on our behalf, having become a high priest forever according to the order of Melchizedek.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="7">
      <VERS vnumber="1">For this Melchizedek, king of Salem, priest of the Most High God, met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings and blessed him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And to him Abraham gave a tenth part of everything. He is first, by translation of his name, king of righteousness, and then he is also king of Salem, that is, king of peace.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Without father, without mother, without genealogy, having neither beginning of days nor end of life, but made like the Son of God, he remains a priest continually.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">See how great he was! Even the patriarch Abraham gave him a tenth of the spoils.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And those descendants of Levi who receive the priestly office have a commandment in the law to take a tenth from the people, that is, from their brethren, though these also are descended from Abraham.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But this man whose genealogy is not derived from them received a tenth from Abraham and blessed him who had the promises.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And without dispute the lesser person is blessed by the greater.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">In this case tithes are received by mortal men, but in that case by one of whom it is witnessed that he lives on.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">One might even say that Levi himself, who receives tithes, paid tithes through Abraham,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">for he was still in the loins of his ancestor when Melchizedek met him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Now if perfection could have been through the Levitical priesthood (for on the basis of it the people received the Law), what further need was there for another priest to arise according to the order of Melchizedek, and not one designated according to the order of Aaron?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">For when there is a change of the priesthood, there must also be a change of the law.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">For the one of whom these things are spoken belonged to another tribe, from which no one has ever served at the altar.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">For it is evident that our Lord was descended from Judah, and in regard to that tribe Moses said nothing about priests.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">This becomes even more evident if another priest arises in the likeness of Melchizedek,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">who has become a priest not on the basis of a law of carnal requirement, but according to the power of an indestructible life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">For it is declared of him, <STYLE css="display:block;text-indent:5mm">»You are a priest forever,</STYLE><STYLE css="display:block;text-indent:10mm">after the order of Melchizedek.«</STYLE></VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">On the one hand, a former commandment is set aside because of its weakness and uselessness</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">(for the law made nothing perfect); and on the other hand, a better hope is introduced, through which we draw near to God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And it was not without an oath.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Those who formerly became priests took their office without an oath, but he became a priest with an oath through the One who said to him, <STYLE css="display:block;text-indent:5mm">»The Lord has sworn</STYLE><STYLE css="display:block;text-indent:10mm">and will not change his mind,</STYLE><STYLE css="display:block;text-indent:5mm">You are a priest forever.«</STYLE></VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Because of this oath, Jesus has become the guarantee of a better covenant.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">The former priests were many in number, because they were prevented by death from continuing in office;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">but he holds his priesthood forever, because he continues for ever.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Therefore he is able also to save forever those who draw near to God through him, since he always lives to make intercession for them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">For it was fitting that we should have such a high priest, holy, blameless, unstained, separated from sinners, exalted above the heavens.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">He does not need, like those high priests, to offer up daily sacrifices, first for his own sins and then for the sins of the people, because he did this once for all when he offered up himself.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">For the Law appoints men as high priests who are weak, but the word of the oath, which came after the Law, appoints a Son who has been made perfect forever.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="8">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now the point in what we are saying is this: we have such a high priest, one who is seated at the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in heaven,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">a minister in the sanctuary, the true tabernacle which is set up by the Lord, not by man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">For every high priest is appointed to offer both gifts and sacrifices; and so it is necessary for this priest also to have something to offer.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Now if he were on earth, he would not be a priest at all, since there are priests who offer the gifts according to the law.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">They serve a copy and shadow of the heavenly sanctuary; for when Moses was about to erect the tabernacle, he was instructed by God, saying, »See that you make everything according to the pattern which was shown you on the mountain.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But as it is, he has obtained a ministry which is as much more excellent than the old as the covenant he mediates is better, since it is enacted on better promises.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">For if that first covenant had been faultless, there would have been no place sought for a second.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">For he finds fault with them when he says: <STYLE css="display:block;text-indent:5mm">»The days are coming, says the Lord,</STYLE><STYLE css="display:block;text-indent:10mm">when I will make a new covenant</STYLE><STYLE css="display:block;text-indent:10mm">with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah;</STYLE></VERS>

        <STYLE css="display:block;text-indent:5mm">for they did not continue in my covenant,</STYLE>

      </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">
        <STYLE css="display:block;text-indent:5mm">This is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel</STYLE>

      </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">When he said, »A new covenant,« he has made the first obsolete. And what is becoming obsolete and growing old is ready to vanish away.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="9">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now even the first covenant had regulations for worship and an earthly sanctuary.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">For there was a tabernacle prepared, the first one, in which were the lampstand and the table and the sacred bread; this is called the holy place.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Behind the second curtain was a tabernacle called the Holy of Holies,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">having the golden altar of incense and the ark of the covenant covered on all sides with gold, which contained a golden jar holding the manna, and Aaron's rod that budded, and the tables of the covenant;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">and above it were the cherubim of glory overshadowing the mercy seat. But of these things we cannot now speak in detail.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">These preparations having thus been made, the priests go continually into the outer tabernacle, performing their ritual duties.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">But into the second only the high priest goes, and he but once a year, and not without taking blood, which he offers for himself and for the sins of the people committed in ignorance.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">The Holy Spirit was showing by this that the way into the holy place had not yet been disclosed as long as the outer tabernacle was still standing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">This is symbolic for the present time. According to this arrangement, gifts and sacrifices are offered which cannot perfect the conscience of the worshiper,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">since they relate only to food and drink and various washings  regulations for the flesh imposed until the time of reformation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">But when Christ appeared as a high priest of the good things that have come, he entered through the greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, that is to say, not of this creation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">He did not enter by means of the blood of goats and calves, but he entered the holy place once for all by his own blood, having obtained eternal redemption.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">For if the blood of goats and bulls and the ashes of a heifer sprinkling those who have been defiled sanctify for the cleansing of the flesh,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">how much more will the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without blemish to God, cleanse your conscience from dead works to serve the living God?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">For this reason he is the mediator of a new covenant, that those who are called may receive the promised eternal inheritance, now that he has died as a ransom to set them free from the transgressions committed under the first covenant.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">For where a will is, there must of necessity be the death of the one who made it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">For a will is in force only when somebody has died, since it never takes effect while the one who made it is living.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">This is why even the first covenant was not ratified without blood.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">For when every commandment of the law had been declared by Moses to all the people, he took the blood of calves and goats, with water and scarlet wool and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book itself and all the people,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">saying, »This is the blood of the covenant which God has commanded you.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And in the same way he sprinkled with the blood both the tabernacle and all the vessels used in worship.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Indeed, under the law almost everything is cleansed with blood, and without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness of sins.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">It was necessary, then, for the copies of the heavenly things to be purified with these sacrifices, but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">For Christ did not enter a holy place made with hands, a copy of the true one, but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Nor was it that he should offer himself again and again, as the high priest enters the holy place year by year with blood not his own.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">For then he would have had to suffer repeatedly since the foundation of the world. But now, he has appeared once for all at the end of the ages to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And just as it is appointed for men to die once, and after that comes judgment,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">so Christ, having been offered once to bear the sins of many, will appear a second time, not to bear sin but to bring salvation to those who are eagerly waiting for him.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="10">
      <VERS vnumber="1">For since the law has only a shadow of the good things to come and not the true form of these realities, it can never, by the same sacrifices which are continually offered year after year, make perfect those who draw near.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Otherwise, would they not have ceased to be offered? If the worshipers had once been cleansed, they would no longer have any consciousness of sins.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">But in these sacrifices there is a reminder of sins year after year.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">For it is impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Therefore, when Christ came into the world, he said: <STYLE css="display:block;text-indent:5mm">»Sacrifice and offering you did not desire,</STYLE><STYLE css="display:block;text-indent:10mm">but a body you prepared for me;</STYLE></VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">

      </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">
        <STYLE css="display:block;text-indent:5mm">Then I said, Behold,</STYLE>
        <STYLE css="display:block;text-indent:10mm">I have come to do your will, O God,</STYLE>
        <STYLE css="display:block;text-indent:5mm">as it is written of me in the roll of the book.«</STYLE>
      </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">When he said above, »You did not desire, nor did you take pleasure in sacrifices and offerings and burnt offerings and sin offerings« (these are offered according to the law),</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">then he said, »Behold, I have come to do your will.« He takes away the first in order to establish the second.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And by that will we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And every priest stands daily at his service, offering time after time the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">But when he had offered for all time one sacrifice for sins, he sat down at the right hand of God,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">waiting from that time until his enemies be made a stool for his feet.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">For by one offering he has perfected for all time those who are sanctified.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And the Holy Spirit also bears witness to us; for after saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">
        <STYLE css="display:block;text-indent:5mm">»This is the covenant that I will make</STYLE>
        <STYLE css="display:block;text-indent:10mm">with them after those days, says the Lord:</STYLE>
        <STYLE css="display:block;text-indent:5mm">I will put my laws into their hearts,</STYLE>
        <STYLE css="display:block;text-indent:10mm">and in their minds I will write them,«</STYLE>
      </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">then he adds, <STYLE css="display:block;text-indent:5mm">»Their sins and their lawless deeds</STYLE><STYLE css="display:block;text-indent:10mm">I will remember no more.«</STYLE></VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Where there is forgiveness of these, there is no longer any offering for sin.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Therefore, brethren, since we have confidence to enter the holy place by the blood of Jesus,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">by a new and living way which he opened for us through the curtain, that is, his flesh,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">and since we have a great priest over the house of God,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="23">Let us hold fast the confession of our hope without wavering, for he who promised is faithful;</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="25">not forsaking our own assembling together, as is the habit of some, but encouraging one another; and all the more, as you see the Day drawing near.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">For if we sin deliberately after we have received the knowledge of the truth, there no longer remains a sacrifice for sins,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">but a fearful expectation of judgment, and a fury of fire which will consume the adversaries.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Anyone who has rejected the law of Moses dies without mercy on the testimony of two or three witnesses.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">How much severer punishment do you think a man will deserve who has trampled under foot the Son of God, and has regarded as an unclean thing the blood of the covenant by which he was sanctified, and has insulted the Spirit of grace?</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="6">But he must ask in faith, with no doubting, for he who doubts is like a wave of the sea that is driven and tossed by the wind.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="9">Do not grumble, brethren, against one another, that you may not be judged; behold, the Judge is standing at the door.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">As an example, brethren, of suffering and patience, take the prophets who spoke in the name of the Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Behold, we call those blessed who endured. You have heard of the endurance of Job, and you have seen the purpose of the Lord, how the Lord is full of compassion and mercy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">But above all, my brethren, do not swear, either by heaven or by earth or with any other oath, but let your yes be yes and your no be no, that you may not fall under condemnation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Is anyone among you suffering? He should pray. Is anyone cheerful? Let him sing praise.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Is any among you sick? Let him call for the elders of the church, and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">and the prayer offered in faith will save the sick man, and the Lord will raise him up; and if he has committed sins, he will be forgiven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Therefore, confess your sins to one another, and pray for one another so that you may be healed. The prayer of a righteous man is powerful and effective.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Elijah was a man with a nature like ours, and he prayed earnestly that it would not rain, and it did not rain on the earth for three years and six months.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Then he prayed again, and the heavens gave rain and the earth produced its fruit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">My brethren, if anyone among you wanders from the truth and someone brings him back,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">let him know that whoever turns a sinner from the error of his way will save his soul from death and will cover a multitude of sins.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">This is now the second letter that I have written to you, beloved, and in both of them I have aroused your sincere mind by way of reminder;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">that you should remember the words spoken beforehand by the holy prophets and the commandment of the Lord and Savior spoken through your apostles.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">First of all you must understand this, that scoffers will come in the last days, with scoffing, following their own lusts</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">and saying, »Where is the promise of his coming? For ever since the fathers fell asleep, all things continue as they were from the beginning of creation.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">They deliberately ignore this fact, that by the word of God heavens existed long ago, and the earth was formed out of water and by means of water,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">through which the world at that time was destroyed, being deluged with water.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">But by the same word the present heavens and earth are reserved for fire, being kept for the day of judgment and destruction of ungodly men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">But do not ignore this one fact, beloved, that with the Lord one day is like a thousand years, and a thousand years like one day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">The Lord is not slow about his promise, as some count slowness, but is patient toward you, not wishing for any to perish but for all to come to repentance.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">But the day of the Lord will come like a thief, in which the heavens will pass away with a roar and the elements will be destroyed with fire, and the earth and the works that are in it will be burned up.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Since all these things are to be destroyed in this way, what sort of people ought you to be in holy lives and godliness,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">looking for and hastening the coming of the day of God, because of which the heavens will be destroyed by fire, and the elements will melt with intense heat!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">But according to his promise we are looking for new heavens and a new earth, in which righteousness dwells.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Therefore, beloved, since you look for these things, be diligent to be found by him in peace, spotless and blameless.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And regard the patience of our Lord as salvation; just as also our beloved brother Paul, according to the wisdom given him, wrote to you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">He writes the same way in all his letters, speaking in them of these matters. His letters contain some things that are hard to understand, which ignorant and unstable people distort, as they do the other Scriptures, to their own destruction.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">You therefore, beloved, knowing this beforehand, be on your guard so that you are not carried away by the error of lawless men and fall from your own steadfastness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">But grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. To him be the glory both now and to the day of eternity. Amen.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="4">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Beloved, do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits to see whether they are of God; because many false prophets have gone out into the world.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">By this you know the Spirit of God: every Spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is of God,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">and every spirit which does not confess Jesus is not of God. This is the spirit of the Antichrist, of which you have heard that it was coming, and now it is in the world already.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="8">He who does not love does not know God, for God is love.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">In this the love of God was made manifest among us, that God sent his only Son into the world, so that we might live through him.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="15">Whoever confesses that Jesus is the Son of God, God abides in him, and he in God.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="19">We love because he first loved us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">If anyone says, »I love God,« and hates his brother, he is a liar; for he who does not love his brother whom he has seen, cannot love God whom he has not seen.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="8">There are three witnesses, the Spirit, the water, and the blood; and these three agree.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="10">He who believes in the Son of God has the testimony in himself. He who does not believe God has made him a liar, because he has not believed in the testimony that God has given of his Son.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="6">The seven angels who had the seven trumpets prepared to sound them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">The first angel sounded his trumpet, and there came hail and fire, mixed with blood, and they were thrown to the earth; and a third of the earth was burned up, and a third of the trees were burned up, and all the green grass was burned up.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">The second angel sounded his trumpet, and something like a great mountain burning with fire was thrown into the sea; and a third of the sea became blood,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="8">But as for the cowardly, the unbelieving, the immoral, as for murderers, fornicators, sorcerers, idolaters, and all liars, their lot will be in the lake that burns with fire and sulfur, which is the second death.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Then came one of the seven angels who had the seven bowls full of the seven last plagues, and spoke to me, saying, »Come, I will show you the Bride, the wife of the Lamb.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And he carried me away in the Spirit to a great and high mountain, and showed me the holy city, Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">having the glory of God, and its brilliance was like that of a very precious jewel, like a jasper, clear as crystal.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">It had a great, high wall, with twelve gates, and at the gates twelve angels, and on the gates were written the names of the twelve tribes of the sons of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">There were three gates on the east, three gates on the north, three gates on the south, and three gates on the west.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And the wall of the city had twelve foundations, and on them were the twelve names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">The one who talked with me had a gold measuring rod to measure the city, and its gates and its walls.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">The city is laid out as a square, and its length is as great as the width; and he measured the city with the rod, twelve thousand stadia; its length and width and height are equal.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">He also measured its wall, a hundred and forty-four cubits by a man's measure, which is also an angel's.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">The wall was made of jasper, and the city of pure gold, as clear as glass.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">The foundations of the city wall were adorned with every kind of precious stone. The first foundation was jasper, the second sapphire, the third chalcedony, the fourth emerald,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">the fifth sardonyx, the sixth carnelian, the seventh chrysolite, the eighth beryl, the ninth topaz, the tenth chrysoprase, the eleventh jacinth, and the twelfth amethyst.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And the twelve gates were twelve pearls, each of the gates made of a single pearl. And the street of the city was pure gold, like transparent glass.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And I saw no temple in the city, for the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are its temple.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And the city has no need of the sun or of the moon to shine on it, for the glory of God gives it light, and its lamp is the Lamb.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">The nations will walk by its light, and the kings of the earth will bring their glory into it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">In the daytime (for there will be no night there) its gates will never be shut;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">they will bring into it the glory and the honor of the nations.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Nothing unclean shall enter it, nor any one who practices abomination or falsehood, but only those whose names are written in the Lamb's book of life.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="22">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Then he showed me the river of the water of life, clear as crystal, flowing from the throne of God and of the Lamb,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">through the middle of the street of the city; also, on either side of the river, the tree of life bearing twelve kinds of fruit, yielding its fruit every month. And the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">There will no longer be any curse; and the throne of God and of the Lamb will be in it, and his servants will serve him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">They will see his face, and his name will be on their foreheads.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And there will be no more night. They will not need the light of a lamp or the light of the sun, for the Lord God will give them light; and they will reign for ever and ever.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And he said to me, »These words are trustworthy and true. And the Lord, the God of the spirits of the prophets, has sent his angel to show his servants the things which must soon take place.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">»And behold, I am coming soon. Blessed is he who keeps the words of the prophecy of this book.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">I, John, am the one who heard and saw these things. And when I heard and saw them, I fell down to worship at the feet of the angel who showed them to me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">But he said to me, »Do not do that! I am a fellow servant with you and your brethren the prophets, and with those who keep the words of this book. Worship God.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And he said to me, »Do not seal up the words of the prophecy of this book, for the time is near.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">He who does wrong, let him do wrong still; and he who is filthy, let him be filthy still; and he who does right, let him do right still; and he who is holy, let him be holy still.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">»Behold, I am coming soon, and my reward is with me, to render to every man according to what he has done.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">I am the Alpha and the Omega, the first and the last, the beginning and the end.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Blessed are those who wash their robes, so that they may have the right to the tree of life, and may enter by the gates into the city.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Outside are the dogs and the sorcerers and the immoral persons and the murderers and the idolaters, and everyone who loves and practices falsehood.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">»I, Jesus, have sent my angel to give you this testimony for the churches. I am the Root and the Offspring of David, the bright Morning Star.«</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">The Spirit and the Bride say, »Come.« And let him who hears say, »Come.« And let him who is thirsty come; let him who wishes take the water of life without price.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">I warn everyone who hears the words of the prophecy of this book: if anyone adds to them, God will add to him the plagues described in this book,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">and if anyone takes away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God will take away his share from the tree of life and from the holy city, which are described in this book.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">He who testifies to these things says, »Yes, I am coming soon.« Amen. Come, Lord Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">The grace of the Lord Jesus be with all. Amen.</VERS>
