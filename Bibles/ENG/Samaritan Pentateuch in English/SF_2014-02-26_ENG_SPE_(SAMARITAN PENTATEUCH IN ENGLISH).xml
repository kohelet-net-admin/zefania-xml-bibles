    <CHAPTER cnumber="1">
      <VERS vnumber="1">In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness  was  upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And God said, Let there be light: and there was light.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And God saw the light, that  it was  good: and God divided the light from the darkness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which  were  under the firmament from the waters which  were  above the firmament: and it was so.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And God called the firmament Heaven. And the evening and the morning were the second day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry  land  appear: and it was so.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And God called the dry  land  Earth; and the gathering together of the waters called he Seas: and God saw that  it was  good.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is in itself, upon the earth: and it was so.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And the earth brought forth grass,  and  herb yielding seed after his kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed  was  in itself, after his kind: and God saw that  it was  good.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And the evening and the morning were the third day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to light over the earth, and to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth: and it was so.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night:  he made  the stars also.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And God set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness: and God saw that  it was  good.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And the evening and the morning were the fourth day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And God said, Let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving creature that hath life, and fowl  that  may fly above the earth in the open firmament of heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And God created great whales, and every living creature that moveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their kind, and every winged fowl after his kind: and God saw that  it was  good.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the earth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And the evening and the morning were the fifth day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after his kind: and it was so.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And God made the beast of the earth after his kind, and cattle after their kind, and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind: and God saw that  it was  good.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">So God created man in his  own  image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed, which  is  upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the which  is  the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth, wherein  there is  life,  I have given  every green herb for meat: and it was so.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold,  it was  very good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="2">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And on the six day God ended his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because that in it he had rested from all his work which God created and made.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">These are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created, in the day that the LORD God made heavens and earth</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And every plant of the field before it was in the earth, and every herb of the field before it grew: for the LORD God had not caused it to rain upon the earth, and  there was  not a man to till the ground.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But there went up a mist from the earth, and watered the whole face of the ground.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And the LORD God formed man  of  the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And the LORD God planted a garden eastward in Eden; and there he put the man whom he had formed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And out of the ground made the LORD God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food; the tree of life also in the midst of the garden, and the tree of knowledge of good and evil.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And a river went out of Eden to water the garden; and from thence it was parted, and became into four heads.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">The name of the first  is  Pison: that  is  it which compasseth the whole land of Havilah, where  there is  gold;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And the gold of that land is good very: there is bdellium and the onyx stone.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And the name of the second river  is  Gihon: the same  is  it that compasseth the whole land of Ethiopia.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And the name of the third river  is  Hiddekel: that  is  it which goeth toward the east of Assyria. And the fourth river  is  Euphrates.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And the LORD God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And the LORD God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And the LORD God said,  It is  not good that the man should be alone; I will make him an help meet for him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And moreover, out of the ground the LORD God formed every beast of the field, and every fowl of the air; and brought unto Adam to see what he would call them: and whatsoever Adam called every living creature, that is the name thereof.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And Adam gave names to all cattle, and to the fowl of the air, and to every beast of the field; but for Adam there was not found an help meet for him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And the LORD God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam, and he slept: and he took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh instead thereof;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And the rib, which the LORD God had taken from man, made he a woman, and brought her unto the man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And Adam said, This  is  now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh: she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be two of them one flesh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not ashamed.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="3">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field which the LORD God had made. And he said unto the woman, Yea, hath God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And the woman said unto the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">But of the fruit of the tree this, which in the midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And when the woman saw that the tree  was  good for food, and that it  was  pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make  one  wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto her husband with her; and he did eat.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they  were  naked; and they sewed fig leaves together, and made themselves aprons.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And they heard the voice of the LORD God walking in the garden in the cool of the day: and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the LORD God amongst the trees of the garden.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And the LORD God called unto Adam, and said unto him, Where  art  thou?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And he said, I heard thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I  was  naked; and I hid myself.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And he said, Who told thee that thou  wast  naked? Hast thou eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And the man said, The woman whom thou gavest  to be  with me, she gave me of the tree, and I did eat.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And the LORD God said unto the woman, What  is  this  that  thou hast done? And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And the LORD God said unto the serpent, Because thou hast done this, thou  art  cursed above all cattle, and above every beast of the field; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And to the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children; and thy desire  shall be  to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And unto Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, of which I commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat of it: cursed  is  the ground for thy sake; in sorrow shalt thou eat  of  it all the days of thy life;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee; and thou shalt eat the herb of the field;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for dust thou  art , and unto your dust shalt thou return.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And Adam called his wife's name Eve; because she was the mother of all living.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Unto Adam also and to his wife did the LORD God make coats of skins, and clothed them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And the LORD God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil: and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Therefore the LORD God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from whence he was taken.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden Cherubims, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="4">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And Adam knew Eve his wife; and she conceived, and bare Cain, and said, I have gotten a man from the LORD.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And she again bare his brother Abel. And Abel was a keeper of sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And in process of time it came to pass, that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering unto the LORD.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And Abel, he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fats thereof. And the LORD had respect unto Abel and to his offering:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">But unto Cain and to his offering he had not respect. And Cain was very wroth, and his countenance fell.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And the LORD said unto Cain, Why art thou wroth? and why is thy countenance fallen?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">If thou doest well, shalt thou not be accepted? and if thou doest not well, sin lieth at the door. And unto thee  shall be  his desire, and thou shalt rule over him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And Cain talked with Abel his brother – let's go to the field: and it came to pass, when they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his brother, and slew him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And the LORD said unto Cain, Where  is  Abel thy brother? And he said, I know not:  Am  I my brother's keeper?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And he said, What hast thou done? the voice of thy brother's blood crieth unto me from the ground.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And now  art  thou cursed from the earth, which hath opened her mouth to receive thy brother's blood from thy hand;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">When thou tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield unto thee her strength; a fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be in the earth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And Cain said unto the LORD, My punishment  is  greater than I can bear.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Behold, thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the earth; and from thy face shall I be hid; and I shall be a fugitive and a vagabond in the earth; and it shall come to pass,  that  every one that findeth me shall slay me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And the LORD said unto him, Therefore whosoever slayeth Cain, vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold. And the LORD set a mark upon Cain, lest any finding him should kill him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And Cain went out from the presence of the LORD, and dwelt in the land of Nod, on the east of Eden.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And Cain knew his wife; and she conceived, and bare Enoch: and he builded a city, and called the name of the city, after the name of his son, Enoch.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And unto Enoch was born Irad: and Irad begat Mehujael: and Mehujael begat Methusael: and Methusael begat Lamech.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And Lamech took unto him two wives: the name of the one  was  Adah, and the name of the other Zillah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And Adah bare Jabal: he was the father of such as dwell in tents, and  of such as have  cattle.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And his brother's name  was  Jubal: he was the father of all such as handle the harp and organ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And Zillah, she also bare Tubal-cain, an instructor of every artificer in brass and iron: and the sister of Tubal-cain  was  Naamah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And Lamech said unto his wives, Adah and Zillah, Hear my voice; ye wives of Lamech, hearken unto my speech: for I have slain a man to my wounding, and a young man to my hurt.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">If Cain shall be avenged sevenfold, truly Lamech seventy and sevenfold.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And Adam knew his wife again; and she bare a son, and he called his name Seth: For God hath appointed me another seed instead of Abel, whom Cain slew.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And to Seth, to him also there was born a son; and he called his name Enos: then began men to call upon the name of the LORD.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="28">Notwithstanding no devoted thing, that a man shall devote unto the LORD of all that he hath,  both  of man and beast, and of the field of his possession, shall be sold or redeemed: every devoted thing  is  most holy unto the LORD.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">None devoted, which shall be devoted of men, shall be redeemed;  but  shall surely be put to death.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And all the tithe of the land, and  whether  of the seed of the land,  or  of the fruit of the tree,  is  the LORD's:  it is  holy unto the LORD.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">And if a man will at all redeem  ought  of his tithes, he shall add thereto the fifth  part  thereof.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">And concerning the tithe of the herd, or of the flock,  even  of whatsoever passeth under the rod, the tenth shall be holy unto the LORD.</VERS>

From thence they removed, and pitched on the other side of Arnon, which is over in the wilderness that cometh out of the coasts of the Amorites: for Arnon  is  the border of Moab, between Moab and the Amorites.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">And the LORD spake unto Moses in the plains of Moab by Jordan  near  Jericho, saying</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Command the children of Israel, that they give unto the Levites of the inheritance of their possession cities to dwell in; and ye shall give  also  unto the Levites suburbs for the cities round about them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And the cities shall they have to dwell in; and the suburbs of them shall be for their cattle, and for their goods, and for all their beasts.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And the suburbs of the cities, which ye shall give unto the Levites,  shall reach  from the wall of the city and outward a thousand cubits round about.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And ye shall measure from without the city on the east side two thousand cubits, and on the south side two thousand cubits, and on the west side two thousand cubits, and on the north side two thousand cubits; and the city  shall be  in the midst: this shall be to you the suburbs of the cities.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And among the cities which ye shall give unto the Levites  there shall be  six cities for refuge, which ye shall appoint for the manslayer, that he may flee thither: and to them ye shall add forty and two cities.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">So  all the cities which ye shall give to the Levites  shall be  forty and eight cities: them  shall ye give  with their suburbs.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And the cities which ye shall give  shall be  of the possession of the children of Israel: from  them that have  many ye shall give many; but from  them that have  few ye shall give few: every one shall give of his cities unto the Levites according to his inheritance which he inheriteth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye be come over Jordan into the land of Canaan;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Then ye shall appoint you cities to be cities of refuge for you; that the slayer may flee thither, which killeth any person at unawares.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And they shall be unto you cities for refuge from the avenger; that the manslayer die not, until he stand before the congregation in judgment.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And of these cities which ye shall give six cities shall ye have for refuge.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Ye shall give three cities on this side Jordan, and three cities shall ye give in the land of Canaan,  which  shall be cities of refuge.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">These six cities shall be a refuge,  both  for the children of Israel, and for the stranger, and for the sojourner among them: that every one that killeth any person unawares may flee thither.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And if he smite him with an instrument of iron, so that he die, he  is  a murderer: the murderer shall surely be put to death.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And if he smite him with throwing a stone, wherewith he may die, and he die, he  is  a murderer: the murderer shall surely be put to death.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And if he smite him with an hand weapon of wood, wherewith he may die, and he die, he  is  a murderer: the murderer shall surely be put to death.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">The revenger of blood himself shall slay the murderer: when he meeteth him, he shall slay him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">But if he thrust him of hatred, or hurl at him by laying of wait, that he die;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Or in enmity smite him with his hand, that he die: he that smote  him  shall surely be put to death;  for  he  is  a murderer: the revenger of blood shall slay the murderer, when he meeteth him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">But if he thrust him suddenly without enmity, or have cast upon him any thing without laying of wait</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Or with any stone, wherewith a man may die, seeing  him  not, and cast  it  upon him, that he die, and  was  not his enemy, neither sought his harm:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Then the congregation shall judge between the slayer and the revenger of blood according to these judgments:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And the congregation shall deliver the slayer out of the hand of the revenger of blood, and the congregation shall restore him to the city of his refuge, whither he was fled: and he shall abide in it unto the death of the high priest, which was anointed with the holy oil.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">But if the slayer shall at any time come without the border of the city of his refuge, whither he was fled;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And the revenger of blood find him without the borders of the city of his refuge, and the revenger of blood kill the slayer; he shall not be guilty of blood:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Because he should have remained in the city of his refuge until the death of the high priest: but after the death of the high priest the slayer shall return into the land of his possession.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">So these  things  shall be for a statute of judgment unto you throughout your generations in all your dwellings.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Whoso killeth any person, the murderer shall be put to death by the mouth of witnesses: but one witness shall not testify against any person  to cause him  to die.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Moreover ye shall take no satisfaction for the life of a murderer, which  is  guilty of death: but he shall be surely put to death.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">And ye shall take no satisfaction for him that is fled to the city of his refuge, that he should come again to dwell in the land, until the death of the great priest.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">So ye shall not pollute the land wherein ye will dwell: for blood it defileth the land: and the land cannot be cleansed of the blood that is shed therein, but by the blood of him that shed it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Defile not therefore the land which ye shall inhabit, wherein I dwell: for I the LORD dwell among the children of Israel.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="36">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And the chief fathers of the families of the children of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, of the families of the sons of Joseph, came near, and spake before Moses, and before the princes, the chief fathers of the children of Israel:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And they said, The LORD commanded my lord to give the land for an inheritance by lot to the children of Israel: and my lord was commanded by the LORD to give the inheritance of Zelophehad our brother unto his daughters.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And if they be married to any of the sons of the  other  tribes of the children of Israel, then shall their inheritance be taken from the inheritance of our fathers, and shall be put to the inheritance of the tribe whereunto they are received: so shall it be taken from the lot of our inheritance.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And when the jubile of the children of Israel shall be, then shall their inheritance be put unto the inheritance of the tribe whereunto they are received: so shall their inheritance be taken away from the inheritance of the tribe of our fathers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And Moses commanded the children of Israel according to the word of the LORD, saying, The tribe of the sons of Joseph hath said well.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">This  is  the thing which the LORD doth command concerning the daughters of Zelophehad, saying, Let them marry to whom they think best; only to the family of the tribe of their father shall they marry.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">So shall not the inheritance of the children of Israel remove from tribe to tribe: for every one of the children of Israel shall keep himself to the inheritance of the tribe of his fathers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And every daughter, that possesseth an inheritance in any tribe of the children of Israel, shall be wife unto one of the family of the tribe of her father, that the children of Israel may enjoy every man the inheritance of his fathers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Neither shall the inheritance remove from  one  tribe to another tribe; but every one of the tribes of the children of Israel shall keep himself to his own inheritance.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Even as the LORD commanded Moses, so did the daughters of Zelophehad:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">For Mahlah, Tirzah, and Hoglah, and Milcah, and Noah, the daughters of Zelophehad, were married unto their father's brothers' sons:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And  they were married into the families of the sons of Manasseh the son of Joseph, and their inheritance remained in the tribe of the family of their father.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">These  are  the commandments and the judgments, which the LORD commanded by the hand of Moses unto the children of Israel in the plains of Moab by Jordan  near  Jericho.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="2">( There are  eleven days'  journey  from Horeb by the way of mount Seir unto Kadesh-barnea.)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And it came to pass in the fortieth year, in the eleventh month, on the first  day  of the month,  that  Moses spake unto the children of Israel, according unto all that the LORD had given him in commandment unto them;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">After he had slain Sihon the king of the Amorites, which dwelt in Heshbon, and Og the king of Bashan, which dwelt at Astaroth in Edrei:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">On this side Jordan, in the land of Moab, began Moses to declare this law, saying</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">The LORD our God spake unto us in Horeb, saying, Ye have dwelt long enough in this mount:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Turn you, and take your journey, and go to the mount of the Amorites, and unto all  the places  nigh thereunto, in the plain, in the hills, and in the vale, in the south, and by the sea side, to the land of the Canaanites, and unto Lebanon, unto the great river, the river Euphrates.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Behold, I have set the land before you: go in and possess the land which the LORD sware unto your fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, to give unto them, to their seed after them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And I spake unto you at that time, saying, I am not able to bear you myself alone:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">The LORD your God hath multiplied you, and, behold, ye  are  this day as the stars of heaven for multitude.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">(The LORD God of your fathers make you a thousand times so many more as ye  are , and bless you, as he hath promised you!)</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="13">Take you wise men, and understanding, and known among your tribes, and I will make them rulers over you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And ye answered me, and said, The thing which thou hast spoken  is  good  for us  to do.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">So I took the chief of your tribes, wise men, and known, and made them heads over you, captains over thousands, and captains over hundreds, captains over fifties, and captains over tens, and officers among your tribes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And I charged your judges at that time, saying, Hear  the causes  between your brethren, and judge righteously between  every  man and his brother, and the stranger  that is  with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Ye shall not respect persons in judgment;  but  ye shall hear the small as well as the great; ye shall not be afraid of the face of man; for the judgment  is  God's: and the cause that is too hard for you, bring  it  unto me, and I will hear it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And I commanded you at that time all the things which ye should do.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And when we departed from Horeb, we went through all that great and terrible wilderness, which ye saw by the way of the mountain of the Amorites, as the LORD our God commanded us; and we came to Kadesh-barnea.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And I said unto you, Ye are come unto the mountain of the Amorites, which the LORD our God doth give unto us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Behold, the LORD thy God hath set the land before thee: go up  and  possess  it , as the LORD God of thy fathers hath said unto thee; fear not, neither be discouraged.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And ye came near unto me every one of you, and said, We will send men before us, and they shall search us out the land, and bring us word again by what way we must go up, and into what cities we shall come.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And the saying pleased me well: and I took twelve men of you, one of a tribe:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And they turned and went up into the mountain, and came unto the valley of Eshcol, and searched it out.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And they took of the fruit of the land in their hands, and brought  it  down unto us, and brought us word again, and said,  It is  a good land which the LORD our God doth give us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Notwithstanding ye would not go up, but rebelled against the commandment of the LORD your God:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And ye murmured in your tents, and said, Because the LORD hated us, he hath brought us forth out of the land of Egypt, to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to destroy us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Whither shall we go up? And our brethren have discouraged our heart, saying, The people  is  greater and more numerous than we; and the cities  are  great and walled up to heaven; and moreover we have seen the sons of the Anakims there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Then I said unto you, Dread not, neither be afraid of them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">The LORD your God which goeth before you, he shall fight for you, according to all that he did for you in Egypt before your eyes;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">And in the wilderness, where thou hast seen how that the LORD thy God bare thee, as a man doth bear his son, in all the way that ye went, until ye came into this place.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">Yet in this thing ye did not believe the LORD your God</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">Who went in the way before you, to search you out a place to pitch your tents  in , in fire by night, to shew you by what way ye should go, and in a cloud by day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">And the LORD heard the voice of your words, and was wroth, and sware, saying</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">Surely there shall not one of these men of this evil generation see that good land, which I sware to give unto your fathers</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">Save Caleb the son of Jephunneh; he shall see it, and to him will I give the land that he hath trodden upon, and to his children, because he hath wholly followed the LORD.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">Also the LORD was angry with me for your sakes, saying, Thou also shalt not go in thither.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">But  Joshua the son of Nun, which standeth before thee, he shall go in thither: encourage him: for he shall cause Israel to inherit it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">Moreover your little ones, which ye said should be a prey, and your children, which in that day had no knowledge between good and evil, they shall go in thither, and unto them will I give it, and they shall possess it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">But  as for  you, turn you, and take your journey into the wilderness by the way of the Red sea.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">Then ye answered and said unto me, We have sinned against the LORD God of us, we will go up and fight, according to all that the LORD our God commanded us. And when ye had girded on every man his weapons of war, ye were ready to go up into the hill.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">And the LORD said unto me, Say unto them, Go not up, neither fight; for I  am  not among you; lest ye be smitten before your enemies.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">So I spake unto you; and ye would not hear, but rebelled against the commandment of the LORD God of you, and went presumptuously up into the hill.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">And the Amalekites and the Cananites, which dwelt in that mountain, came out against you, and chased you, as bees do, and destroyed you in Seir,  even  unto Hormah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">And ye returned and wept before the LORD; but the LORD would not hearken to your voice, nor give ear unto you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">So ye abode in Kadesh many days, according unto the days that ye abode  there .</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="2">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Then we turned, and took our journey into the wilderness by the way of the Red sea, as the LORD spake unto me: and we compassed mount Seir many days.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And the LORD spake unto me, saying</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Ye have compassed this mountain long enough: turn you northward.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And command thou the people, saying, Ye  are  to pass through the coast of your brethren the children of Esau, which dwell in Seir; and they shall be afraid of you: take ye good heed unto yourselves therefore:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Meddle not with them; for I will not give you of their land for possession, no, not so much as a foot breadth; because I have given mount Seir unto Esau  for  a possession.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Ye shall buy meat of them for money, that ye may eat; and ye shall also buy water of them for money, that ye may drink.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">For the LORD thy God hath blessed thee in all the works of thy hands: he knoweth thy walking through this great wilderness: these forty years the LORD thy God  hath been  with thee; thou hast lacked nothing. And I am sending messengers to king Edom to say: I shall cross over your land. Not I shall turn in the field and in the gardens, and not we shall drink from the wells. By the way of the king we shall go and not we shall turn right and left until we have crossed over boundary of you. And he said: You shall not cross in me, lest in sword I shall go out to meet you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And when we passed by from our brethren the children of Esau, which dwelt in Seir, through the way of the plain from Elath, and from Ezion-gaber, we turned and passed by the way of the wilderness of Moab.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And the LORD said unto me, Distress not the Moabites, neither contend with him in battle: for I will not give thee of their land  for  a possession; because I have given Ar unto the children of Lot  for  a possession.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">The Emims dwelt therein in times past, a people great, and many, and tall, as the Anakims;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Which also were accounted giants, as the Anakims; but the Moabites call them Emims.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">The Hori also dwelt in Seir beforetime; but the children of Esau succeeded them, and they had destroyed them, LORD, from before them, and possessed and dwelt in their stead; as Israel did unto the land of his possession, which the LORD gave unto them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And now rise up,  said I  and journey, and get you over the brook Zered. And we went over the brook Zered.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And the space in which we came from Kadesh-barnea, until we were come over the brook Zered,  was  thirty and eight years; until all the generation of the men of war were wasted out from among the host, as the LORD sware unto them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">For indeed the hand of the LORD was against them, to destroy them from among the host, until they were consumed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">So it came to pass, when all the men of war were consumed and dead from among the people</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">That the LORD said unto me, saying</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="19">And  when  thou comest nigh over against the children of Ammon, distress them not, nor meddle with them: for I will not give thee of the land of the children of Ammon  any  possession; because I have given it unto the children of Lot  for  a possession.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">(That also was accounted a land of giants: giants dwelt therein in old time; and the Ammonites call them Zamzummims;)</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="25">This day will I begin to put the dread of thee and the fear of thee upon the nations  that are  under the whole heaven, who shall hear report of thee, and shall tremble, and be in anguish because of thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And I sent messengers out of the wilderness of Kedemoth unto Sihon king of Heshbon with words of peace, saying</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="28">Thou shalt sell me meat for money, that I may eat; and give me water for money, that I may drink: only I will pass through on my feet;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">(As the children of Esau which dwell in Seir, and the Moabites which dwell in Ar, did unto me;) until I shall pass over Jordan into the land which the LORD our God giveth us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">But Sihon king of Heshbon would not let us pass by him: for the LORD thy God hardened his spirit, and made his heart obstinate, that he might deliver him into thy hand, as  appeareth  this day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">And the LORD said unto me, Behold, I have begun to give Sihon king of Heshbon, the Amorite, and his land before thee: begin to possess, that thou mayest inherit his land.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">Then Sihon came out against us, he and all his people, to fight at Jahaz.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">And the LORD our God delivered him before us; and we smote him, and his sons, and all his people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">And we took all his cities at that time, and utterly destroyed the men, and the women, and the little ones, of every city, we left none to remain:</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="36">From Aroer, which  is  by the brink of the river of Arnon, and  from  the city that  is  by the river, even unto Gilead, there was not one city too strong for us: the LORD our God delivered all unto our hand:</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">And Moses went and spake these words unto all Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And he said unto them, I  am  an hundred and twenty years old this day; I can no more go out and come in: also the LORD hath said unto me, Thou shalt not go over this Jordan.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">The LORD thy God, he will go over before thee,  and  he will destroy these nations from before thee, and thou shalt possess them: and Joshua, he shall go over before thee, as the LORD hath said.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And the LORD shall do unto them as he did to Sihon and to Og, kings of the Amorites, and unto the land of them, whom he destroyed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And the LORD shall give them up before your face, that ye may do unto them according unto all the commandments which I have commanded you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Be strong and of a good courage, fear not, nor be afraid of them: for the LORD thy God, he  it is  that doth go with thee; he will not fail thee, nor forsake thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And Moses called unto Joshua, and said unto him in the sight of all Israel, Be strong and of a good courage: for thou must go with this people unto the land which the LORD hath sworn unto their fathers to give them; and thou shalt cause them to inherit it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And the LORD, he  it is  that doth go before thee; he will be with thee, he will not fail thee, neither forsake thee: fear not, neither be dismayed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And Moses wrote this law, and delivered it unto the priests the sons of Levi, which bare the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and unto all the elders of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And Moses commanded them, saying, At the end of  every  seven years, in the solemnity of the year of release, in the feast of tabernacles</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">When all Israel is come to appear before the LORD thy God in the place which he shall choose, thou shalt read this law before all Israel in their hearing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Gather the people together, men, and women, and children, and thy stranger that  is  within thy gates, that they may hear, and that they may learn, and fear the LORD your God, and observe to do all the words of this law:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And  that  their children, which have not known  any thing , may hear, and learn to fear the LORD your God, as long as ye live in the land whither ye go over Jordan to possess it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And the LORD said unto Moses, Behold, thy days approach that thou must die: call Joshua, and present yourselves in the tabernacle of the congregation, that I may give him a charge. And Moses and Joshua went, and presented themselves in the tabernacle of the congregation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And the LORD appeared in the tabernacle in a pillar of a cloud: and the pillar of the cloud stood over the door of the tabernacle.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And the LORD said unto Moses, Behold, thou shalt sleep with thy fathers; and this people will rise up, and go a whoring after the gods of the strangers of the land, whither they go  to be  among them, and will forsake me, and break my covenant which I have made with them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Then my anger shall be kindled against them in that day, and I will forsake them, and I will hide my face from them, and they shall be devoured, and many evils and troubles shall befall them; so that they will say in that day, Are not these evils come upon us, because our God  is  not among us?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And I will surely hide my face in that day from them for all the evils which they shall have wrought, in that they are turned unto other gods.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Now therefore write ye this song for you, and teach it the children of Israel: and put it in their mouths, that this song may be a witness for me against the children of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">For when I shall have brought them into the land which I sware unto their fathers to give them, that floweth with milk and honey; and they shall have eaten and filled themselves, and waxen fat; then will they turn unto other gods, and serve them, and provoke me, and break my covenant.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And it shall come to pass, when many evils and troubles are befallen them, that this song shall testify against them as a witness; for it shall not be forgotten out of the mouths of their seed: for I know their imagination which they go about, even now, before I have brought them into the land which I sware to their fathers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Moses therefore wrote this song the same day, and taught it the children of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And he gave Joshua the son of Nun a charge, and said, Be strong and of a good courage: for thou shalt bring the children of Israel into the land which I sware unto them: and I will be with thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And it came to pass, when Moses had made an end of writing the words of this law in a book, until they were finished</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">That Moses commanded the Levites, which bare the ark of the covenant of the LORD, saying</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Take this book of the law, and put it in the side of the ark of the covenant of the LORD your God, that it may be there for a witness against thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">For I know thy rebellion, and thy stiff neck: behold, while I am yet alive with you this day, ye have been rebellious against the LORD; and how much more after my death?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Gather unto me all the elders of your tribes, and your officers, that I may speak these words in their ears, and call heaven and earth to record against them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">For I know that after my death ye will utterly corrupt  yourselves , and turn aside from the way which I have commanded you; and evil will befall you in the latter days; because ye will do evil in the sight of the LORD, to provoke him to anger through the work of your hands.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And Moses spake in the ears of all the congregation of Israel the words of this song, until they were ended.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="4">He is  the Rock, his work  is  perfect: for all his ways  are  judgment: a God of truth and without iniquity, just and right  is  he.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="15">But Jeshurun waxed fat, and kicked: thou art waxen fat, thou art grown thick, thou art covered  with fatness ; then he forsook God  which  made him, and lightly esteemed the Rock of his salvation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">They provoked him to jealousy with strange  gods , and with abominations provoked they him to anger.</VERS>
