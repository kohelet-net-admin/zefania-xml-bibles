Revised King James New Testament: Preface

In the Revised King James New Testament I've tried to maintain the feel of the
King James Version, frequently using British spellings, and including much of
the KJV syntax and even some antiquated words. I've used the masculine in the
old, gender- inclusive sense. Brackets [ ] enclose some passages that are
generally noted in modern translations as being missing in the best manuscripts.
The RKJ New Testament was developed using various modern translations. I did not
return to the original languages in developing it.

Since one of my goals was to make a modern translation of the New Testament
widely and inexpensively available, I am placing the Revised King James New
Testament into the public domain. I no longer make any copyright claim for it.
You are only answerable to God for how you use it.

  <BIBLEBOOK bnumber="40">
    <CHAPTER cnumber="1">
      <VERS vnumber="1">The book of the genealogy of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Abraham was the father of Isaac; and Isaac the father of Jacob; and Jacob the father of Judah and his brothers;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And Judah the father of Perez and Zarah by Tamar; and Perez the father of Hezron; and Hezron the father of Ram;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And Ram the father of Amminadab; and Amminadab the father of Nahshon; and Nahshon the father of Salma;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And Salma the father of Boaz by Rahab; and Boaz the father of Obed by Ruth; and Obed the father of Jesse;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And Jesse the father of David the king; and David the king the father of Solomon by her who had been the wife of Uriah;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And Solomon the father of Rehoboam; and Rehoboam the father of Abijah; and Abijah the father of Asa;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And Asa the father of Jehoshaphat; and Jehoshaphat the father of Joram; and Joram the father of Azariah;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And Azariah the father of Jotham; and Jotham the father of Ahaz; and Ahaz the father of Hezekiah;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And Hezekiah the father of Manasseh; and Manasseh the father of Amon; and Amon the father of Josiah;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And Josiah the father of Jeconiah and his brothers, about the time they were carried away to Babylon:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And after the exile to Babylon, Jeconiah became the father of Shealtiel; and Shealtiel the father of Zerubbabel;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And Zerubbabel the father of Abiud; and Abiud the father of Eliakim; and Eliakim the father of Azor;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And Azor the father of Zadok; and Zadok the father of Achim; and Achim the father of Eliud;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And Eliud the father of Eleazar; and Eleazar the father of Matthan; and Matthan the father of Jacob;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And Jacob the father of Joseph, the husband of Mary, by whom was born Jesus, who is called Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">So all the generations from Abraham to David are fourteen generations; and from David until the exile to Babylon are fourteen generations; and from the exile to Babylon to Christ are fourteen generations.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Now the birth of Jesus Christ happened in this way: When his mother Mary was betrothed to Joseph, before they came together, she was found to be with child by the Holy Spirit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Then Joseph her husband, being a just man, and not willing to disgrace her, decided to divorce her secretly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">But while he thought on these things, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, Joseph, son of David, do not fear to take Mary as your wife: for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Spirit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And she shall bring forth a son, and you shall call his name JESUS: for he shall save his people from their sins.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Now all this was done to fulfill that which was spoken by the Lord through the prophet, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Behold, a virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel, which translated means, God with us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Then Joseph, being raised from sleep, did as the angel of the Lord had bidden him, and took her as his wife:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And kept her a virgin until she had brought forth a son: and he called his name JESUS.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="2">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judaea in the days of Herod the king, behold, wise men came from the east to Jerusalem,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Saying, Where is he who has been born King of the Jews? for we have seen his star in the east, and have come to worship him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">When Herod the king had heard these things, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And when he had gathered all the chief priests and scribes of the people together, he inquired of them where the Christ was to be born.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And they said to him, In Bethlehem of Judaea: for thus it was written by the prophet,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And you Bethlehem, in the land of Judah, are not the least among the princes of Judah: for out of you shall come a Governor, who shall rule my people Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Then Herod, when he had secretly called the wise men, ascertained from them at what time the star appeared.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And he sent them to Bethlehem, and said, Go and search diligently for the child; and when you have found him, bring me word, that I may come and worship him also.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">When they had heard the king, they departed; and, lo, the star, which they saw in the east, went before them, until it came and stood over where the child was.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">When they saw the star, they rejoiced with exceedingly great joy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And when they had come into the house, they saw the child with Mary his mother, and fell down, and worshipped him: and when they had opened their treasures, they presented to him gifts; gold, and frankincense, and myrrh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And being warned by God in a dream that they should not return to Herod, they departed to their own country by another way.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And when they had departed, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream, saying, Arise, and take the child and his mother, and flee to Egypt, and remain there until I bring you word: for Herod will seek the child, to destroy him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And he arose, and took the child and his mother by night, and departed to Egypt:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And was there until the death of Herod: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Lord through the prophet, saying, Out of Egypt I have called my son.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Then Herod, when he saw that he had been tricked by the wise men, was exceedingly angry, and sent forth, and killed all the children who were in Bethlehem, and in all the region, from two years old and under, according to the time which he had ascertained from the wise men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">In Rama there was heard a voice, weeping, and loud lamentation, Rachel weeping for her children, and she would not be comforted, because they were no more.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">But when Herod was dead, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Saying, Arise, and take the child and his mother, and go to the land of Israel: for those who sought the child's life are dead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And he arose, and took the child and his mother, and came to the land of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">But when he heard that Archelaus was reigning in Judaea in the place of his father Herod, he was afraid to go there: and, being warned by God in a dream, he turned aside to the regions of Galilee:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And he came and lived in a city called Nazareth: that what was spoken by the prophets might be fulfilled, He shall be called a Nazarene.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="3">
      <VERS vnumber="1">In those days John the Baptist came, preaching in the wilderness of Judaea,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And saying, Repent: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">For this is he who was spoken of by the prophet Isaiah, when he said, The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And John had a garment of camel's hair, and a leather girdle about his waist; and his food was locusts and wild honey.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Then Jerusalem, and all Judaea, went out to him, and all the region around the Jordan,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And were baptized by him in the Jordan, confessing their sins.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees come for baptism, he said to them, You brood of vipers, who warned you to flee from the wrath to come?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Therefore, bring forth fruit in keeping with repentance:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And do not think to say to yourselves, We have Abraham as our father: for I say to you, that God is able from these stones to raise up children to Abraham.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And now the axe is laid to the root of the trees: therefore every tree which does not bring forth good fruit is cut down, and cast into the fire.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">I baptize you with water for repentance: but he who comes after me is mightier than I, whose sandals I am not worthy to carry: he shall baptize you with the Holy Spirit, and with fire.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">His winnowing fork is in his hand, and he will thoroughly clean his threshing floor, and gather his wheat into the barn; but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Then Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan to John, to be baptized by him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">But John tried to prevent him, saying, I need to be baptized by you, and do you come to me?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And Jesus answered him, Let it be so now: for thus it is fitting for us to fulfill all righteousness. Then he consented.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And Jesus, when he was baptized, went up immediately out of the water: and, lo, the heavens were opened to him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove, and lighting upon him:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And lo, a voice from heaven, saying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="4">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Then Jesus was led up by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And when he had fasted forty days and forty nights, he was hungry.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And when the tempter came to him, he said, If you are the Son of God, command that these stones be made bread.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">But he answered and said, It is written, Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Then the devil took him up into the holy city, and set him on a pinnacle of the temple,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And said to him, If you are the Son of God, cast yourself down: for it is written, He shall give his angels charge concerning you: and on their hands they shall bear you up, lest at any time you dash your foot against a stone.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Jesus said to him, Again it is written, You shall not tempt the Lord your God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Again, the devil took him to an exceedingly high mountain, and showed him all the kingdoms of the world, and the glory of them;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And said to him, All these things will I give you, if you will fall down and worship me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Then Jesus said to him, Begone, Satan: for it is written, You shall worship the Lord your God, and him only shall you serve.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Then the devil left him, and, behold, angels came and ministered to him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Now when Jesus heard that John had been cast into prison, he departed into Galilee;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And leaving Nazareth, he came and lived in Capernaum, which is upon the sea coast, in the region of Zebulun and Naphtali:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">That what was spoken by Isaiah the prophet might be fulfilled,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">The land of Zebulun, and the land of Naphtali, by the way of the sea, beyond the Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">The people who sat in darkness have seen a great light; and to those who sat in the region and shadow of death, a light has sprung up.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">From that time Jesus began to preach, and to say, Repent: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And walking by the sea of Galilee, he saw two brothers, Simon called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea: for they were fishermen.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And he said to them, Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And they immediately left their nets, and followed him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And going on from there, he saw two other brothers, James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, in a boat with Zebedee their father, mending their nets; and he called them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And they immediately left the boat and their father, and followed him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And Jesus went about all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing every kind of disease and every kind of infirmity among the people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And his fame went throughout all Syria: and they brought to him all sick people who were taken with various diseases and torments, those who were possessed by devils, and those who were epileptic, and paralytics; and he healed them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And great multitudes of people followed him from Galilee, and from Decapolis, and from Jerusalem, and from Judaea, and from beyond the Jordan.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="5">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And seeing the multitudes, he went up on the mountain: and when he sat down, his disciples came to him:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And he opened his mouth, and taught them, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Blessed are the poor in spirit: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Blessed are those who mourn: for they shall be comforted.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Blessed are the meek: for they shall inherit the earth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness: for they shall be filled.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Blessed are the merciful: for they shall obtain mercy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Blessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be called sons of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Blessed are those who are persecuted for righteousness' sake: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Blessed are you, when men shall revile you, and persecute you, and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely, for my sake.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Rejoice, and be exceedingly glad: for great is your reward in heaven: for so they persecuted the prophets who were before you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">You are the salt of the earth: but if the salt has lost its taste, with what shall it be salted? it is no longer good for anything, but to be cast out, and to be trodden under foot by men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">You are the light of the world. A city that is set on a hill cannot be hidden.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Nor do men light a lamp, and put it under a bushel, but on a lampstand; and it gives light to all who are in the house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father who is in heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Do not think that I have come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I have not come to destroy, but to fulfill.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">For truly I say to you, Until heaven and earth pass away, not the smallest letter, not the least stroke, shall by any means pass away from the law, until all is fulfilled.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Therefore, whoever shall break one of the least commandments, and shall so teach men to do, he shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven: but whoever shall do and teach them, the same shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">For I say to you, That unless your righteousness exceeds the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees, you shall never enter into the kingdom of heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">You have heard that it was said to them of old, You shall not kill; and whoever shall kill shall be subject to judgment:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">But I say to you, That whoever is angry with his brother shall be in danger of judgment: and whoever shall say to his brother, Raca, shall be in danger of the council: but whoever shall say, You fool, shall be in danger of the hell of fire.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Therefore if you bring your gift to the altar, and there remember that your brother has something against you;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Leave your gift before the altar, and go your way; first be reconciled to your brother, and then come and offer your gift.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Come to terms with your adversary quickly, while you are on the way with him; lest your adversary deliver you to the judge, and the judge deliver you to the officer, and you be cast into prison.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Truly I say to you, You shall by no means come out of there, until you have paid the last farthing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">You have heard that it was said, You shall not commit adultery:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">But I say to you, That whoever looks at a woman to lust for her has already committed adultery with her in his heart.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And if your right eye causes you to sin, pluck it out, and cast it from you: for it is better for you that one of your members should perish, than that your whole body should be cast into hell.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And if your right hand causes you to sin, cut it off, and cast it from you: for it is better for you that one of your members should perish, than that your whole body should be cast into hell.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">It has been said, Whoever shall divorce his wife, let him give her a certificate of divorce:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">But I say to you, That whoever shall divorce his wife, except for the cause of unchastity, causes her to commit adultery: and whoever shall marry a woman who has been divorced commits adultery.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">Again, you have heard that it has been said to them of old, You shall not swear falsely, but shall fulfill your oaths to the Lord:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">But I say to you, Do not swear at all; either by heaven; for it is God's throne:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">Or by the earth; for it is his footstool: or by Jerusalem; for it is the city of the great King.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">Nor shall you swear by your head, because you can not make one hair white or black.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">But let your statements be, Yes for yes; No for no: for whatever is more than these comes from the evil one.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">You have heard that it has been said, An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">But I say to you, Do not resist evil: but whoever shall strike you on your right cheek, turn to him the other also.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">And if any man wants to sue you, and take away your shirt, let him have your coat also.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">And whoever shall compel you to go one mile, go with him two.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">Give to him who asks from you, and do not turn away from him who would borrow from you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">You have heard that it has been said, You shall love your neighbour, and hate your enemy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">But I say to you, Love your enemies, and pray for those who persecute you;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">That you may be sons of your Father who is in heaven: for he makes his sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sends rain on the just and on the unjust.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">For if you love those who love you, what reward have you? do not even the tax gatherers do the same?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">And if you greet your brethren only, what are you doing more than others? do not even the Gentiles do the same?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">Therefore be perfect, as your Father who is in heaven is perfect.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="6">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Take heed that you do not practice your righteousness before men, to be seen by them: otherwise you have no reward from your Father who is in heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Therefore, when you give alms, do not sound a trumpet before you, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, that they may have praise from men. Truly I say to you, They have received their reward.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">But when you give alms, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">That your alms may be in secret: and your Father who sees in secret shall reward you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And when you pray, do not be like the hypocrites: for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and at the corners of the streets, that they may be seen by men. Truly I say to you, They have received their reward.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But you, when you pray, enter into your inner room, and when you have shut your door, pray to your Father who is in secret; and your Father who sees in secret shall reward you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">But when you pray, do not use meaningless repetition, as the Gentiles do: for they think that they shall be heard for their many words.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Therefore, do not be like them: for your Father knows what things you have need of, before you ask him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Therefore, pray in this manner: Our Father in heaven, Hallowed be your name.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Your kingdom come. Your will be done on earth, as it is in heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Give us this day our daily bread.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And forgive us our debts, as we also have forgiven our debtors.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">For if you forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">But if you do not forgive men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Moreover, when you fast, do not look somber as the hypocrites do: for they disfigure their faces, that they may be seen by men to be fasting. Truly I say to you, They have received their reward.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">But you, when you fast, anoint your head, and wash your face;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">That you may not be seen fasting by men, but by your Father who is in secret: and your Father, who sees in secret, shall reward you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Do not lay up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and rust destroy, and where thieves break in and steal:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">But lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroys, and where thieves do not break in and steal:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">The light of the body is the eye: therefore, if your eye is sound, your whole body shall be full of light.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">But if your eye is bad, your whole body shall be full of darkness. Therefore, if the light that is in you is darkness, how great is that darkness!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">No man can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. You cannot serve God and mammon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Therefore I say to you, Do not be anxious about your life, what you shall eat, or what you shall drink; nor for your body, what you shall put on. Is not life more than food, and the body more than clothing?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Behold the birds of the air: they do not sow, nor do they reap, nor gather into barns; yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not worth much more than they?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Which of you by being anxious can add one cubit to the span of his life?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And why are you anxious about clothing? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow; they do not toil, nor do they spin:</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="9">And when he departed from there, he went into their synagogue:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And, behold, there was a man who had a withered hand. And they asked him, saying, Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath? that they might accuse him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And he said to them, What man is there among you, if he has one sheep, and if it falls into a pit on the sabbath day, will not lay hold of it, and lift it out?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">How much more valuable then is a man than a sheep? Therefore, it is lawful to do good on the sabbath.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Then he said to the man, Stretch forth your hand. And he stretched it forth; and it was restored, whole like the other.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Then the Pharisees went out, and held a council against him, how they might destroy him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">But Jesus, knowing this, withdrew from there: and great multitudes followed him, and he healed them all;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And charged them that they should not make him known:</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="23">And all the people were amazed, and said, Is this not the son of David?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">But when the Pharisees heard it, they said, This fellow casts out devils only by Beelzebub, the prince of the devils.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And Jesus knew their thoughts, and said to them, Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation; and every city or house divided against itself shall not stand:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And if Satan casts out Satan, he is divided against himself; how then shall his kingdom stand?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And if I cast out devils by Beelzebub, by whom do your children cast them out? therefore they shall be your judges.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">That same day Jesus went out of the house, and sat by the sea.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And great multitudes gathered around him, so that he went into a boat, and sat; and the whole multitude stood on the shore.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And he spoke many things to them in parables, saying, Behold, a sower went forth to sow;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And when he sowed, some seeds fell by the wayside, and the birds came and devoured them:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Some fell upon stony places, where they did not have much earth: and at once they sprang up, because they had no depth of soil:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And when the sun came up, they were scorched; and because they had no root, they withered away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And some fell among thorns; and the thorns sprang up, and choked them:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">But other seeds fell into good ground, and brought forth fruit, some a hundredfold, some sixtyfold, some thirtyfold.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">He who has ears, let him hear.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And the disciples came, and said to him, Why do you speak to them in parables?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">He answered them, It has been given to you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it has not been given.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">For whoever has, to him shall more be given, and he shall have an abundance: but whoever does not have, even what he has shall be taken away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Therefore, I speak to them in parables: because seeing they see not; and hearing they hear not, neither do they understand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And in them is fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah, who says, You shall continue to hear, but not understand; and you shall continue to see, but not perceive:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">For this people's heart has become dull, and their ears are hard of hearing, and their eyes they have closed; lest they should see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and should understand with their heart, and should be converted, and I should heal them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">But blessed are your eyes, for they see: and your ears, for they hear.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">For truly I say to you, That many prophets and righteous men have desired to see those things which you see, and have not seen them; and to hear those things which you hear, and have not heard them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Hear then the parable of the sower.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">When anyone hears the word of the kingdom, and does not understand it, then the wicked one comes, and catches away that which was sown in his heart. This is the seed that was sown by the wayside.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">The seed sown upon stony places is he who hears the word, and immediately receives it with joy;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Yet he has no root in himself, and endures only for a while: when tribulation or persecution arises because of the word, he falls away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">The seed sown among the thorns is he who hears the word; and the cares of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches, choke the word, and he becomes unfruitful.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">But the seed sown on the good ground is he who hears the word, and understands it; he also bears fruit, and brings forth, in one case a hundredfold, in another sixty, and in another thirty.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">He put forth another parable to them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his field:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">But while everyone slept, his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat, and went away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">But when the wheat had sprung up, and brought forth fruit, then the tares appeared also.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">So the servants of the landowner came and said to him, Sir, did you not sow good seed in your field? where then did the tares come from?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">He said to them, An enemy has done this. The servants said to him, Do you wish for us to go and gather them up?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">But he said, No; lest while you gather up the tares, you also pull up the wheat with them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Let both grow together until the harvest: and at the time of harvest I will say to the reapers, Gather together first the tares, and bind them in bundles to burn them: but gather the wheat into my barn.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">He put forth another parable to them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is like a grain of mustard seed, which a man took, and sowed in his field:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">It is the smallest of all seeds: but when it is fully grown, it is the largest of the garden plants, and becomes a tree, so that the birds of the air come and lodge in its branches.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">He spoke another parable to them; The kingdom of heaven is like leaven, which a woman took, and hid in three measures of flour, until it was all leavened.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">All these things Jesus spoke to the multitude in parables; and he spoke nothing to them without using a parable,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">That what was spoken by the prophet might be fulfilled, I will open my mouth in parables; I will utter things which have been kept secret from the foundation of the world.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">Then Jesus sent the multitude away, and went into the house: and his disciples came to him, saying, Explain to us the parable of the tares of the field.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">He answered them, He who sows the good seed is the Son of man;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">The field is the world; the good seed are the sons of the kingdom; but the tares are the sons of the wicked one;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">The enemy who sowed them is the devil; the harvest is the end of the world; and the reapers are the angels.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">Therefore, as the tares are gathered and burned in the fire; so shall it be at the end of this age.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">The Son of man shall send forth his angels, and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that offend, and those who do iniquity;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">And shall cast them into a furnace of fire: where there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">Then the righteous shall shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father. He who has ears, let him hear.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a treasure hidden in a field, which a man found and hid again, then for joy went and sold all that he had, and bought that field.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant seeking fine pearls.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">When he found one pearl of great value, he went and sold all that he had, and bought it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a net, that was cast into the sea, and gathered fish of every kind:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">Which, when it was full, they drew it to shore, and sat down, and gathered the good into vessels, but cast the bad away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">So shall it be at the end of the world: the angels shall come forth, and separate the wicked from among the just,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">And shall cast them into the furnace of fire, where there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="51">Jesus said to them, Have you understood all these things? They said to him, Yes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="52">Then he said to them, Therefore every scribe who is instructed about the kingdom of heaven is like a man who is an owner of a house, who brings forth out of his treasure things new and old.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="53">And it came to pass, that when Jesus had finished these parables, he departed from there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="54">And when he had come to his home town, he taught them in their synagogue, so that they were astonished, and said, Where did this man get this wisdom, and these miracles?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="55">Is this not the carpenter's son? is not his mother called Mary? and his brothers, James, and Joseph, and Simon, and Judas?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="56">And his sisters, are they not all with us? Where then did this man get all these things?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="57">And they were offended by him. But Jesus said to them, A prophet is not without honour, except in his home town, and in his own house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="58">And he did not do many miracles there because of their unbelief.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">At that time Herod the tetrarch heard of the fame of Jesus,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And he said to his servants, This is John the Baptist; he has risen from the dead; and therefore miraculous powers are at work in him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">For Herod had laid hold on John, and bound him, and put him in prison for the sake of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">For John said to him, It is not lawful for you to have her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And although he would have put him to death, he feared the people, because they counted him as a prophet.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But when Herod's birthday came, the daughter of Herodias danced before them, and pleased Herod.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Whereupon he promised with an oath to give her whatever she would ask.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="12">And his disciples came, and took the body, and buried it, and went and told Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">When Jesus heard of it, he departed from there by boat privately into a solitary place: and when the people heard this, they followed him on foot out of the cities.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">As Jesus went ashore, and saw a great multitude, he was moved with compassion toward them, and he healed their sick.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And when it was evening, his disciples came to him, saying, This is a desolate place, and the day is now past; send the multitude away, that they may go into the villages and buy themselves food.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">But Jesus said to them, They need not depart; you give them something to eat.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And they said to him, We have here but five loaves, and two fish.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">He said, Bring them here to me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And he commanded the multitude to sit down on the grass, and took the five loaves, and the two fish, and looking up to heaven, he blessed, and broke, and gave the loaves to his disciples, and the disciples to the multitude.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And they all ate, and were filled: and they took up what remained of the fragments, twelve baskets full.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And those who had eaten were about five thousand men, besides women and children.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And immediately Jesus made his disciples get into a boat, and to go before him to the other side, while he sent the multitude away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And when he had sent the multitude away, he went up on the mountain by himself to pray: and when evening came, he was there alone.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="25">And in the fourth watch of the night Jesus went to them, walking on the sea.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And when the disciples saw him walking on the sea, they were troubled, saying, It is a ghost; and they cried out in fear.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">But immediately Jesus spoke to them, saying, Take heart; it is I; do not be afraid.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And Peter answered him and said, Lord, if it is you, bid me come to you on the water.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And he said, Come. And Peter got down out of the boat, and walked on the water to Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">But when he saw the wind, he was afraid; and beginning to sink, he cried out, saying, Lord, save me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">And immediately Jesus stretched forth his hand, and caught him, and said to him, O you of little faith, why did you doubt?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">And when they got into the boat, the wind ceased.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">Then those who were in the boat came and worshipped him, saying, Truly you are the Son of God.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">But he answered and said to them, Why do you transgress the commandment of God by your tradition?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">For God commanded, saying, Honour your father and mother: and, He who curses father or mother, let him be put to death.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">But you say, Whoever shall say to his father or his mother, Whatever of mine might benefit you is a gift to God;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Then he is free not to honour his father or his mother. Thus have you made the commandment of God void by your tradition.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="13">But he answered and said, Every plant which my heavenly Father has not planted shall be rooted up.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Let them alone: they are blind leaders of the blind. And if the blind lead the blind, both shall fall into the ditch.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Then Peter answered and said to him, Explain to us this parable.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="17">Do you not yet understand, that whatever enters in at the mouth goes into the belly, and is eliminated?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">But those things which proceed out of the mouth come forth from the heart; and they defile the man.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="22">And, behold, a woman of Canaan came out of that region, and cried to him, saying, Have mercy on me, O Lord, Son of David; my daughter is grievously vexed with a devil.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="27">And she said, True, Lord: yet the dogs eat the crumbs which fall from their masters' table.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Then Jesus answered and said to her, O woman, great is your faith: be it done for you as you wish. And her daughter was made well from that very hour.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="14">And they said, Some say that you are John the Baptist: some, Elijah; and others, Jeremiah, or one of the prophets.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">He said to them, But who do you say that I am?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Simon Peter answered and said, You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And Jesus answered and said to him, Blessed are you, Simon, son of Jonah: for flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but my Father who is in heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And I say also to you, That you are Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church; and the gates of Hades shall not prevail against it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And I will give to you the keys of the kingdom of heaven: and whatever you shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven: and whatever you shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Then he charged his disciples that they should tell no man that he was the Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">From that time forth Jesus began to show to his disciples that he must go to Jerusalem, and suffer many things from the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and be raised on the third day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Then Peter took him, and began to rebuke him, saying, God forbid it, Lord: this shall not happen to you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">But he turned, and said to Peter, Get behind me, Satan: you are an offence to me: for you are not thinking of the things of God, but of the things of men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Then Jesus said to his disciples, If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">For whoever wishes to save his life shall lose it: and whoever loses his life for my sake shall find it.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="27">For the Son of man shall come in the glory of his Father with his angels; and then he shall reward every man according to his works.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Truly I say to you, There are some standing here, who shall not taste of death, until they see the Son of man coming in his kingdom.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">And after six days Jesus took Peter, James, and John his brother, and brought them up a high mountain where they were alone,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">And, behold, there appeared to them Moses and Elijah, talking with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Then Peter answered, and said to Jesus, Lord, it is good for us to be here: if you wish, let us make three tabernacles here; one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">While he was still speaking, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them: and a voice out of the cloud said, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased; hear him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And when the disciples heard it, they fell on their faces, and were very afraid.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And Jesus came and touched them, and said, Arise, and do not be afraid.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And when they had lifted up their eyes, they saw no one, except Jesus only.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="10">And his disciples asked him, saying, Why then do the scribes say that Elijah must come first?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And Jesus answered them, Elijah truly shall come first, and restore all things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">But I say to you, That Elijah has already come, and they did not know him, but have done to him whatever they pleased. Likewise shall the Son of man suffer at their hands.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Then the disciples understood that he spoke to them of John the Baptist.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And when they had come to the multitude, a certain man came to him, kneeling down before him, and saying,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="18">And Jesus rebuked the devil; and it departed out of him: and the boy was cured from that very hour.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Then the disciples came to Jesus privately, and said, Why could we not cast it out?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And Jesus said to them, Because of your unbelief: for truly I say to you, If you have faith as a grain of mustard seed, you shall say to this mountain, Move from here to there; and it shall move; and nothing shall be impossible for you.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="25">He said, Yes. And when he came into the house, Jesus spoke to him first, saying, What do you think, Simon? from whom do the kings of the earth take customs or tribute? from their own sons, or from strangers?</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">At that time the disciples came to Jesus, saying, Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And Jesus called a little child to him, and set him in the midst of them,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And said, Truly I say to you, Unless you are converted, and become like little children, you shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Therefore, whoever shall humble himself as this little child, he is greatest in the kingdom of heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And whoever shall receive one such little child in my name receives me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But whoever shall cause one of these little ones who believe in me to sin, it would be better for him that a great millstone be hung around his neck, and that he be drowned in the depths of the sea.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Woe to the world because of temptations! for it must be that temptations come; but woe to that man by whom the temptation comes!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Therefore, if your hand or your foot causes you to sin, cut it off, and cast it from you: it is better for you to enter into life maimed or crippled, rather than having two hands or two feet to be cast into eternal fire.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And if your eye causes you to sin, pluck it out, and cast it from you: it is better for you to enter into life with one eye, rather than having two eyes to be cast into the fire of hell.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Take heed that you do not despise one of these little ones; for I say to you, That in heaven their angels always behold the face of my Father who is in heaven.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="13">And if he finds it, truly I say to you, he rejoices more over that sheep, than over the ninety-nine which did not go astray.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">In the same way, it is not the will of your Father who is in heaven, that one of these little ones should perish.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">If your brother shall sin against you, go and tell him his fault between you and him alone: if he shall hear you, you have gained your brother.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="22">Jesus said to him, I do not say to you, Up to seven times, but, Up to seventy times seven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Therefore, the kingdom of heaven is like a certain king who wanted to settle accounts with his servants.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And when he had begun the settlement, one was brought to him, who owed him ten thousand talents.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">But because he had nothing with which to pay, his lord commanded him to be sold, and his wife, and children, and all that he had, and payment to be made.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Therefore the servant fell down, and implored him, saying, Lord, have patience with me, and I will pay you all.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Then the lord of that servant was moved with compassion, and released him, and forgave him the debt.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">But the same servant went out, and found one of his fellow servants, who owed him a hundred denarii: and he laid hands on him, and took him by the throat, saying, Pay me what you owe.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="30">He refused however, but went and cast him into prison, until he should pay the debt.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="34">And his lord was angry, and delivered him to the torturers, until he should pay all that was due him.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">And it came to pass, that when Jesus had finished these sayings, he departed from Galilee, and came into the region of Judaea beyond the Jordan;</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">The Pharisees also came to him, tempting him, and saying to him, Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any cause?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And he answered and said to them, Have you not read, that he who made them at the beginning made them male and female,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And said, For this reason shall a man leave father and mother, and shall cling to his wife: and the two shall be one flesh?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Therefore they are no longer two, but one flesh. Therefore, what God has joined together, let man not separate.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">They said to him, Why then did Moses command to give a certificate of divorce, and to put her away?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">He said to them, Because of the hardness of your hearts Moses allowed you to put away your wives: but from the beginning it was not so.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And I say to you, Whoever shall divorce his wife, except for unchastity, and shall marry another, commits adultery.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">His disciples said to him, If this is the case of a man with his wife, it is good not to marry.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">But he said to them, Not all men can receive this saying, only those to whom it is given.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">For there are some eunuchs, who were born so, from their mothers' wombs: and there are some eunuchs, who were made eunuchs by men: and there are eunuchs, who have made themselves eunuchs for sake of the kingdom of heaven. He who is able to receive it, let him receive it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Then little children were brought to him, that he should put his hands on them, and pray: but the disciples rebuked them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">But Jesus said, Let the little children come to me, and do not forbid them: for to such as these belongs the kingdom of heaven.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="16">And, behold, one came and said to him, Teacher, what good thing shall I do, that I may have eternal life?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And he said to him, Why do you ask me what is good? there is no one good but One: but if you wish to enter into life, keep the commandments.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">He said to him, Which ones? Jesus said, You shall not murder, You shall not commit adultery, You shall not steal, You shall not bear false witness,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Honour your father and your mother: and, You shall love your neighbour as yourself.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">The young man said to him, All these things I have kept from my youth up: what do I still lack?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Jesus said to him, If you wish to be perfect, go and sell what you have, and give to the poor, and you shall have treasure in heaven: and come and follow me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">But when the young man heard that, he went away sorrowful: for he had much property.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="24">And again I say to you, It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">When his disciples heard this, they were exceedingly amazed, saying, Who then can be saved?</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="27">Then Peter answered and said to him, Behold, we have forsaken all, and followed you; what then shall we have?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And Jesus said to them, Truly I say to you, At the renewal of all things, when the Son of man shall sit upon the throne of his glory, you who have followed me shall sit upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">For the kingdom of heaven is like a landowner, who went out early in the morning to hire labourers to work in his vineyard.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">And he went out about the third hour, and saw others standing idle in the marketplace,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="5">Again he went out about the sixth and ninth hour, and did likewise.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And about the eleventh hour he went out, and found others standing, and said to them, Why are you standing here idle all the day?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">They said to him, Because no man has hired us. He said to them, Go also into the vineyard.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">So when evening had come, the lord of the vineyard said to his steward, Call the labourers, and give them their wages, beginning with the last to the first.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And when those who were hired about the eleventh hour came, every man received a denarius.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="23">And he said to them, You shall indeed drink of my cup: but to sit on my right hand, and on my left, is not mine to give, but it shall be given to those for whom it has been prepared by my Father.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And when the ten heard this, they were moved with indignation against the two brothers.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="36">Again, he sent other servants, more than the first: and they did the same to them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">But last of all he sent to them his son, saying, They will respect my son.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="40">Therefore, when the owner of the vineyard comes, what will he do to those tenants?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">They said to him, He will miserably destroy those wicked men, and will let out his vineyard to other tenants, who shall give him the fruits in their seasons.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">And Jesus answered and spoke to them again in parables, and said,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">The kingdom of heaven is like a certain king, who gave a marriage feast for his son,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And sent forth his servants to call those who were invited to the marriage feast: but they would not come.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Again, he sent forth other servants, saying, Tell those who are invited, Behold, I have prepared my dinner: my oxen and my fat calves have been killed, and all things are ready: come to the marriage feast.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">But they made light of it, and went their ways, one to his farm, another to his business:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And the rest took his servants, and treated them spitefully, and killed them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">The king was angry, and he sent forth his armies, and destroyed those murderers, and burned their city.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Then he said to his servants, The wedding is ready, but those who were invited were not worthy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Therefore, go into the highways, and as many as you shall find, invite to the marriage feast.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">So those servants went out into the highways, and gathered together as many as they found, both bad and good: and the wedding hall was filled with guests.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And when the king came in to see the guests, he saw there a man who had no wedding garment:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And he said to him, Friend, how did you come in here not having a wedding garment? And he was speechless.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Then the king said to the servants, Bind him hand and foot, and take him away, and cast him into outer darkness; where there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">For many are called, but few are chosen.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Then the Pharisees went, and took counsel how they might entangle him in his talk.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And they sent out to him their disciples with the Herodians, saying, Teacher, we know that you are truthful, and teach the way of God in truth, nor do you defer to any man: for you do not regard the position of men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Therefore tell us, What do you think? Is it lawful to pay taxes to Caesar, or not?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">But Jesus perceived their wickedness, and said, Why do you test me, you hypocrites?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Show me the money used for the tax. And they brought to him a denarius.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="22">When they had heard these words, they marvelled, and left him, and went their way.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">The same day the Sadducees, who say that there is no resurrection, came to him and asked him,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Teacher, Moses said, If a man dies, having no children, his brother shall marry his wife, and raise up children for his brother.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Now there were among us seven brothers: and the first, after he had married, died, and, having no children, left his wife to his brother:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">The same happened to the second, and the third, down to the seventh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And last of all the woman died.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="29">Jesus answered them, You err, not knowing the scriptures, nor the power of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">For in the resurrection they neither marry, nor are given in marriage, but are like the angels in heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">And as for the resurrection of the dead, have you not read that which was spoken to you by God,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob? God is not the God of the dead, but of the living.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="37">Jesus said to him, You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">This is the first and greatest commandment.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">And the second is like it, You shall love your neighbour as yourself.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">While the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">What do you think of the Christ? whose son is he? They said to him, The Son of David.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">He said to them, How then does David in the spirit call him Lord, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">The LORD said to my Lord, Sit on my right hand, until I put your enemies under your feet?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">If then David calls him Lord, how is he his son?</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Then Jesus spoke to the multitude, and to his disciples,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="5">But all their works they do to be seen by men: they make broad their phylacteries, and enlarge the borders of their garments,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="2">You know that after two days is the feast of the passover, and the Son of man will be delivered up to be crucified.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Then the chief priests, the scribes, and the elders of the people assembled together at the palace of the high priest, who was called Caiaphas,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And conspired to take Jesus by stealth, and kill him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">But they said, Not on the feast day, lest there be an uproar among the people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Now when Jesus was in Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">There came to him a woman having an alabaster box of very precious ointment, and poured it on his head as he reclined at table.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">But when his disciples saw it, they were indignant, saying, To what purpose is this waste?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">For this ointment might have been sold for much, and given to the poor.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">But Jesus, aware of this, said to them, Why do you trouble the woman? for she has done a good work for me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">For you always have the poor with you; but you do not always have me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">When she poured this ointment on my body, she did it for my burial.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Truly I say to you, Wherever this gospel shall be preached in the whole world, what this woman has done shall also be told in memory of her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Then one of the twelve, named Judas Iscariot, went to the chief priests,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And said to them, What will you give me if I deliver him to you? And they paid him thirty pieces of silver.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And from that time on he sought an opportunity to betray him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Now on the first day of the feast of unleavened bread the disciples came to Jesus, saying, Where will you have us prepare for you to eat the passover?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And he said, Go into the city to a certain man, and say to him, The Teacher says, My time is at hand; I will keep the passover at your house with my disciples.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And the disciples did as Jesus had directed them; and they made ready the passover.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Now when the evening had come, he sat down with the twelve.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And as they ate, he said, Truly I say to you, that one of you shall betray me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And they were exceedingly sorrowful, and every one of them began to say to him, Lord, is it I?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And he answered and said, He who dipped his hand with me in the dish shall betray me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">The Son of man goes as it is written of him: but woe to that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! it would have been better for that man if he had not been born.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Then Judas, who betrayed him, answered and said, Teacher, is it I? He said to him, You have said it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and blessed it, and broke it, and gave it to the disciples, and said, Take, eat; this is my body.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave it to them, saying, Drink of it, all of you;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">For this is my blood of the covenant, which is shed for many for the forgiveness of sins.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">But I say to you, I will not drink again of this fruit of the vine, until that day when I drink it anew with you in my Father's kingdom.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And when they had sung a hymn, they went out to the mount of Olives.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Then Jesus said to them, This night all of you shall fall away because of me: for it is written, I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">But after I have risen, I will go before you into Galilee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">Peter answered and said to him, Though all fall away because of you, yet I will never fall away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Jesus said to him, Truly I say to you, That this night, before the cock crows, you shall deny me thrice.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">Peter said to him, Though I die with you, yet I will not deny you. And all the disciples said the same.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">Then Jesus came with them to a place called Gethsemane, and said to the disciples, Sit here, while I go and pray over there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">And he took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, and began to be sorrowful and very troubled.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">Then he said to them, My soul is exceedingly sorrowful, even to death: remain here, and watch with me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">And he went a little further, and fell on his face, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from me: nevertheless, not as I will, but as you will.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">And he came to the disciples, and found them asleep, and said to Peter, What, could you not watch with me one hour?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">Watch and pray, that you do not enter into temptation: the spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">He went away again, a second time, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if this may not pass away from me, except I drink it, your will be done.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">And he came and found them asleep again: for their eyes were heavy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">And he left them, and went away again, and prayed the third time, saying the same words.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">Then he came to his disciples, and said to them, Sleep on now, and take your rest: behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">Rise, let us be going: behold, he who betrays me is at hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">And while he yet spoke, lo, Judas, one of the twelve, came, and with him a great multitude with swords and clubs, from the chief priests and elders of the people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">Now he who betrayed him gave them a sign, saying, Whomever I shall kiss, he is the one: hold him fast.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">And forthwith he came to Jesus, and said, Hail, Rabbi; and kissed him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">And Jesus said to him, Friend, do that which you have come for. Then they came, and laid hands on Jesus, and took him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="51">And, behold, one of those with Jesus stretched out his hand, and drew his sword, and struck a servant of the high priest, and cut off his ear.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="52">Then Jesus said to him, Put your sword back in its place: for all those who take up the sword shall perish by the sword.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="53">Do you think that I cannot now pray to my Father, and he shall at once give me more than twelve legions of angels?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="54">But how then shall the scriptures be fulfilled, that say it must happen this way?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="55">In that same hour Jesus said to the multitudes, Do you come out to take me with swords and clubs, as if I was a thief ? I sat daily with you teaching in the temple, and you did not lay hold on me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="56">But all this was done, that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled. Then all the disciples forsook him, and fled.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="57">And those who had laid hold on Jesus led him away to Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders were assembled.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="58">But Peter followed him from afar to the high priest's courtyard, and went in, and sat with the guards, to see the outcome.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="59">Now the chief priests, and elders, and all the council, sought false witness against Jesus, to put him to death;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="60">But found none, though many false witnesses came forth. At last two false witnesses came,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="61">And said, This fellow said, I am able to destroy the temple of God, and to build it in three days.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="62">And the high priest arose, and said to him, Do you have no answer? what is it which these men testify against you?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="63">But Jesus held his peace. And the high priest answered and said to him, I charge you by the living God, that you tell us whether you are the Christ, the Son of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="64">Jesus said to him, You have said so: nevertheless I say to you, Hereafter you shall see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="65">Then the high priest rent his clothes, saying, He has spoken blasphemy; what further need have we of witnesses? behold, now you have heard his blasphemy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="66">What do you think? They answered and said, He is worthy of death.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="67">Then they spit in his face, and beat him; and others struck him with the palms of their hands,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="68">Saying, Prophesy to us, you Christ, Who is it who struck you?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="69">Now Peter sat outside in the courtyard: and a maid came to him, saying, You also were with Jesus of Galilee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="70">But he denied it before them all, saying, I know not what your are saying.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="71">And when he went out to the porch, another maid saw him, and said to those who were there, This fellow was also with Jesus of Nazareth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="72">And again he denied it with an oath, I do not know the man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="73">And after a while the bystanders came to him, and said to Peter, Surely you also are one of them; for your speech betrays you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="74">Then he began to curse and to swear, saying, I do not know the man. And immediately the cock crowed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="75">And Peter remembered the word Jesus said to him, Before the cock crows, you shall deny me thrice. And he went out, and wept bitterly.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="27">
      <VERS vnumber="1">When the morning had come, all the chief priests and elders of the people took counsel against Jesus to put him to death:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And when they had bound him, they led him away, and delivered him to Pilate, the governor.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Then Judas, who had betrayed him, when he saw that he was condemned, repented, and brought back the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Saying, I have sinned in that I have betrayed innocent blood. And they said, What is that to us? see to that yourself.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And he cast down the pieces of silver in the temple, and departed, and went and hanged himself.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And the chief priests took the silver pieces, and said, It is not lawful to put them into the treasury, because it is the price of blood.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And they took counsel, and bought with the money the potter's field, to bury strangers in.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Therefore that field has been called, The field of blood, to this day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet, saying, And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of him on whom a value had been set by the sons of Israel;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And gave them for the potter's field, as the Lord directed me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And Jesus stood before the governor: and the governor asked him, Are you the King of the Jews? And Jesus said to him, You say so.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And when he was accused by the chief priests and elders, he said nothing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Then Pilate said to him, Do you not hear how many things they testify against you?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And he answered him not a word; so that the governor marvelled greatly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Now at the feast the governor was accustomed to release to the people one prisoner, whom they wanted.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And they had at that time a notorious prisoner, called Barabbas.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Therefore, when they were gathered together, Pilate said to them, Whom do you want me to release for you? Barabbas, or Jesus who is called Christ?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">For he knew that it was because of envy they had delivered him up.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">When he sat down on the judgment seat, his wife sent a message to him, saying, Have nothing to do with that just man: for I have suffered many things this day in a dream because of him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">But the chief priests and elders persuaded the multitude that they should ask for Barabbas, and have Jesus executed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">The governor answered them, Which of the two do you want me to release for you? They said, Barabbas.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Pilate said to them, What shall I do then with Jesus who is called Christ? They all said to him, Let him be crucified.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And the governor said, Why, what evil has he done? But they cried out all the more, saying, Let him be crucified.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">When Pilate saw that he could not prevail, but rather that a tumult was starting, he took water, and washed his hands before the multitude, saying, I am innocent of this man's blood: you see to it yourselves.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Then all the people answered, and said, His blood be on us, and on our children.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Then he released Barabbas to them: and when he had scourged Jesus, he delivered him over to be crucified.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the Praetorium, and gathered around him the whole cohort of soldiers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And they stripped him, and put a scarlet robe on him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And when they had weaved a crown of thorns, they put it upon his head, and a reed in his right hand: and they bowed their knees before him, and mocked him, saying, Hail, King of the Jews!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And they spit upon him, and took the reed, and struck him on the head.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">And after had mocked him, they took the robe off of him, and put his own clothing on him, and led him away to crucify him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">And as they came out, they found a man of Cyrene, Simon by name: they compelled him to bear his cross.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">And when they had come to a place called Golgotha, that is to say, place of a skull,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">They gave him wine to drink mixed with gall: and when he had tasted it, he would not drink.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">And they crucified him, and divided his garments among them by casting lots.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">And sitting down they watched him there;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">And set up over his head the accusation against him, which read, THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">At that time there were two robbers crucified with him, one on the right hand, and another on the left.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">And those who passed by reviled him, wagging their heads,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">Saying, You who would destroy the temple, and build it in three days, save yourself. If you are the Son of God, come down from the cross.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">Likewise the chief priests, with the scribes and elders, mocked him, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">He saved others; he cannot save himself. If he is the King of Israel, let him now come down from the cross, and we will believe in him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">He trusted in God; let him deliver him now, if he will have him: for he said, I am the Son of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">The robbers also, who were crucified with him, cast the same insult at him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">Now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land until the ninth hour.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">And about the ninth hour Jesus cried out with a loud voice, saying, Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani? that is to say, My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">Some of those who stood there, when they heard that, said, This man calls for Elijah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">And immediately one of them ran, and took a sponge, and filled it with vinegar, and put it on a reed, and gave it to him to drink.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">The rest said, Wait, let us see whether Elijah will come to save him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">Jesus, when he had cried out again with a loud voice, yielded up the spirit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="51">And, behold, the veil of the temple was torn in two from the top to the bottom; and the earth quaked, and the rocks were split;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="52">And the graves were opened; and many bodies of the saints who slept arose,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="53">And came out of the graves after his resurrection, and went into the holy city, and appeared to many.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="54">Now when the centurion, and those who were with him, watching Jesus, saw the earthquake, and those things that were done, they feared greatly, saying, Truly this was the Son of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="55">And many women were there, beholding from afar. They had followed Jesus from Galilee, ministering to him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="56">Among them was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James and Joseph, and the mother of the sons of Zebedee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="57">When evening had come, there came a rich man from Arimathaea, named Joseph, who had himself also become a disciple of Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="58">He went to Pilate, and asked for the body of Jesus. Then Pilate commanded it be delivered to him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="59">And when Joseph had taken the body, he wrapped it in a clean linen cloth,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="60">And laid it in his own new tomb, which he had cut out in the rock: and he rolled a great stone over the door of the tomb, and departed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="61">And Mary Magdalene, and the other Mary, were there, sitting opposite the tomb.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="62">Now the next day, which followed the day of preparation, the chief priests and Pharisees came together before Pilate,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="63">Saying, Sir, we remember that while he was yet alive that deceiver said, After three days I will rise again.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="64">Therefore, command that the tomb be made secure until the third day, lest his disciples come by night, and steal him away, and say to the people, He has risen from the dead: so the last deception shall be worse than the first.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="65">Pilate said to them, You have a guard: go your way; make it as secure as you can.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="66">So they went, and made the tomb secure, sealing the stone and posting a guard.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="28">
      <VERS vnumber="1">At the end of the sabbath, as it began to dawn on the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary came to see the tomb.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And, behold, there was a great earthquake: for an angel of the Lord descended from heaven, and came and rolled back the stone from the door, and sat upon it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">His countenance was like lightning, and his clothing white as snow:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And for fear of him the guards shook, and became as dead men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And the angel said to the women, Fear not: for I know that you seek Jesus, who was crucified.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">He is not here: for he has risen, as he said. Come, see the place where he lay.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And go quickly, and tell his disciples that he has risen from the dead; and, behold, he goes before you into Galilee; there you shall see him: lo, I have told you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And they departed quickly from the tomb with fear and great joy; and ran to bring his disciples word.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And as they went to tell his disciples, behold, Jesus met them, saying, Hail. And they came and held him by the feet, and worshipped him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Then Jesus said to them, Do not be afraid: go tell my brethren to go into Galilee, and there they shall see me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Now when they were going, behold, some of the guards came into the city, and told the chief priests all the things that had happened.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And when they had assembled with the elders, and had taken counsel, they gave much money to the soldiers,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Saying, Say, His disciples came by night, and stole him away while we slept.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And if this comes to the governor's ears, we will satisfy him, and keep you out of trouble.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">So they took the money, and did as they were told: and this story is commonly reported among the Jews to this day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Then the eleven disciples went away into Galilee, to a mountain where Jesus had directed them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And when they saw him, they worshipped him: but some doubted.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And Jesus came and spoke to them, saying, All power has been given to me in heaven and on earth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Go, therefore, and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Teaching them to observe all things that I have commanded you: and, lo, I am with you always, even to the end of the age.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="1">
      <VERS vnumber="1">The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">As it is written in the prophets, Behold, I send my messenger before your face, who shall prepare your way.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">John baptized in the wilderness, and preached a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And there went out to him all the land of Judaea, and all those of Jerusalem, and they were all baptized by him in the river Jordan, confessing their sins.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And John was clothed with camel's hair, and with a leather girdle about his waist; and he ate locusts and wild honey;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And preached, saying, After me there comes one mightier than I, the thong of whose sandals I am not worthy to stoop down and untie.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">I have baptized you with water: but he shall baptize you with the Holy Spirit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And it came to pass in those days, that Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee, and was baptized by John in the Jordan.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And immediately as he came up out of the water, he saw the heavens opened, and the Spirit like a dove descending upon him:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And there came a voice from heaven, saying, You are my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And immediately the Spirit drove him into the wilderness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And he was there in the wilderness forty days, tempted by Satan; and was with the wild beasts; and the angels ministered to him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Now after John was put in prison, Jesus came to Galilee, preaching the gospel of God,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And saying, The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand: repent and believe the gospel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Now as he walked by the sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew his brother casting a net into the sea: for they were fishermen.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And Jesus said to them, Come after me, and I will make you fishers of men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And immediately they forsook their nets, and followed him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And when he had gone a little farther, he saw James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, who were in their boat mending their nets.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And immediately he called them: and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired servants, and went after him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And they went into Capernaum; and immediately on the sabbath day he entered into the synagogue, and taught.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And they were astonished at his teaching: for he taught them as one who had authority, and not as the scribes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit; and he cried out,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Saying, What have we to do with you, Jesus of Nazareth? have you come to destroy us? I know who you are, the Holy One of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Hold your peace, and come out of him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And when the unclean spirit had torn him, and cried out with a loud voice, it came out of him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And they were all amazed, so that they questioned among themselves, saying, What is this? what a new teaching this is! for with authority he commands even the unclean spirits, and they obey him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And immediately his fame spread throughout all the region around Galilee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And as soon as they had come out of the synagogue, they entered into the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Now Simon's mother-in-law lay sick with a fever, and immediately they told him of her.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">And again he began to teach by the seaside: and a great multitude gathered around him, so that he entered into a boat, and sat in it; and the whole multitude was on the shore.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And he taught them many things by parables, and said to them in his teaching,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Listen; Behold, a sower went out to sow:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And it came to pass, as he sowed, some seed fell by the wayside, and the birds of the air came and devoured it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And some fell on stony ground, where it did not have much earth; and immediately it sprang up, because it had no depth of soil:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But when the sun came up, it was scorched; and because it had no root, it withered away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And some fell among thorns, and the thorns grew up, and choked it, and it yielded no fruit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And other seed fell on good ground, and yielded fruit that sprang up and increased; and brought forth, some thirty, and some sixty, and some a hundredfold.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And he said to them, He who has ears to hear, let him hear.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And when he was alone, those who were about him with the twelve asked him about the parable.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And he said to them, To you it has been given to know the mystery of the kingdom of God: but to those who are outside, all these things are done in parables:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">That seeing they may see, and not perceive; and hearing they may hear, and not understand; lest they should be converted, and their sins be forgiven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And he said to them, Do you not understand this parable? How then will you understand all the parables?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">The sower sows the word.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And these are the ones by the wayside, where the word is sown; when they have heard, Satan comes immediately, and takes away the word that was sown in them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And likewise, these are the ones who are like seed sown on stony ground; who, when they have heard the word, immediately receive it with gladness;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">But have no root in themselves, and so endure but for a time: afterward, when affliction or persecution arises for the word's sake, they immediately fall away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And these are the ones who are like seed sown among thorns; they hear the word,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And the cares of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches, and the lust for other things enter in, and choke the word, and it becomes unfruitful.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And these are the ones who are like seed sown on good ground; they hear the word, and receive it, and bring forth fruit, some thirty, some sixty, and some a hundredfold.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And he said to them, Is a lamp brought in to be put under a bushel, or under a bed? and not to be set on a lampstand?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">For there is nothing hidden, which shall not be revealed; nor is anything kept secret that shall not come to light.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">If any man has ears to hear, let him hear.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And he said to them, Take heed what you hear: with the measure you use, it shall be measured to you: and more besides.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">For he who has, to him shall more be given: and he who has not, from him shall be taken even that which he has.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And he said, The kingdom of God is like a man who casts seed upon the ground;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And goes to sleep and rises, night and day, and the seed sprouts and grows up, though he does not know how.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">For the earth brings forth fruit by itself; first the blade, then the ear, after that the full grain in the ear.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">But when the grain is ripe, immediately he puts the sickle to it, because the harvest has come.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And he said, To what shall we liken the kingdom of God? or what parable shall we use for it?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">It is like a grain of mustard seed, which is the smallest seed planted in the ground:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">But when it is sown, it grows up, and becomes greater than all garden herbs, and shoots out great branches; so that the birds of the air may nest under the shadow of it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">And with many such parables he spoke the word to them, as they were able to hear it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">And he did not speak to them without a parable: and when they were alone, he explained all things to his disciples.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">And the same day, when evening had come, he said to them, Let us pass over to the other side.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">And when they had sent the multitude away, they took him just as he was in the boat. And there were also with him other boats.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">And there arose a great storm of wind, and the waves beat into the boat, so that it was almost swamped.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">And he was in the stern, asleep on a pillow: and they awoke him, and said to him, Teacher, do you not care that we perish?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">And he arose, and rebuked the wind, and said to the sea, Peace, be still. And the wind ceased, and there was a great calm.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">And he said to them, Why are you so fearful? how is it that you have no faith?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">And they were exceedingly fearful, and said to one another, What manner of man is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him?</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">And they came to the other side of the sea, into the country of the Garasenes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And when he got out of the boat, immediately there met him from out of the tombs a man with an unclean spirit,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Who had his dwelling among the tombs; and no man could bind him, no, not even with chains:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Because he had been often bound with fetters and chains, and he had pulled apart the chains, and broken the fetters in pieces: no man could subdue him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And always, night and day, he was in the mountains, and in the tombs, crying out, and cutting himself with stones.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But when he saw Jesus from afar, he ran and bowed before him,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And cried out with a loud voice, and said, What have I to do with you, Jesus, Son of the most high God? I implore you by God, that you do not torment me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">For he was saying to him, Come out of the man, you unclean spirit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And he was asking him, What is your name? And he answered, saying, My name is Legion: for we are many.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And he begged him much that he would not send them out of the country.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Now there was a great herd of swine feeding there on the hillside.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And all the devils begged him, saying, Send us to the swine, that we may enter into them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And Jesus gave them permission. And the unclean spirits went out, and entered into the swine: and the herd ran violently down a steep place into the sea, (there were about two thousand;) and they were drowned in the sea.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And those who fed the swine fled, and told it in the city, and in the country. And people went out to see what it was that had happened.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And they came to Jesus, and saw the man who had been possessed by the devil, who had the legion, sitting, and clothed, and in his right mind: and they were afraid.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And those who saw it told what happened to the man who was possessed by the devil, and to the swine.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And they began to beg him to depart from their region.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And as he got into the boat, the man who had been possessed by the devil begged him that he might go with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Yet Jesus did not let him, but said to him, Go home to your friends, and tell them what great things the Lord has done for you, and how he has had compassion on you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And he departed, and began to proclaim in Decapolis what great things Jesus had done for him: and all the people were amazed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And when Jesus crossed over again by boat to the other side, many people gathered around him: and he was near the sea.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And, behold, there came one of the rulers of the synagogue, Jairus by name; and when he saw him, he fell at his feet,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="24">And Jesus went with him; and many people followed him, and crowded him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And a certain woman, who had a flow of blood for twelve years,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And had suffered many things from many physicians, and had spent all that she had, and was not helped, but rather grew worse,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">When she heard of Jesus, came in the crowd from behind, and touched his garment.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">For she said, If I just touch his clothes, I shall be healed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And immediately the flow of blood was dried up; and she felt in her body that she was healed of the affliction.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And Jesus, immediately knowing that power had gone out of him, turned around in the crowd, and said, Who touched my clothes?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">And his disciples said to him, You see the multitude crowding you, and you say, Who touched me?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">And he looked around to see the woman who had done this thing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">But the woman, knowing what had happened in her, came in fear and trembling and fell down before him, and told him all the truth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">And he said to her, Daughter, your faith has made you well; go in peace, and be healed of your affliction.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">While he was speaking, messengers came from the ruler of the synagogue's house and said, Your daughter is dead: why trouble the Teacher further?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">As soon as Jesus heard what was spoken, he said to the ruler of the synagogue, Do not be afraid, only believe.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">And he allowed no man to follow him, except Peter, and James, and John the brother of James.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">And he came to the house of the ruler of the synagogue, and saw the tumult, and those who wept and wailed greatly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">And when he had come in, he said to them, Why do you make this tumult, and weep? the child is not dead, but sleeps.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">And they laughed him to scorn. But when he had put them all out, he took the father and the mother of the child, and those who were with him, and entered in where the child was.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">And he took her by the hand, and said to her, Talitha cum; which means, Little girl, I say to you, arise.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">And immediately the girl arose, and walked; for she was twelve years old. And they were completely astonished.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">And he strictly ordered them that no one should know of this; and told them to give her something to eat.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">And he went out from there, and came into his own country; and his disciples followed him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And when the sabbath day came, he began to teach in the synagogue: and many who heard him were astonished, saying, Where did this man get these things? and what wisdom is this which is given to him, that even such miracles are performed by his hands?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Is this not the carpenter, the son of Mary, the brother of James, and Joseph, of Judas, and Simon? and are not his sisters here with us? And they were offended by him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">But Jesus said to them, A prophet is not without honour, except in his own country, and among his own kin, and in his own house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And he could do no miracles there, except to lay his hands upon a few sick people, and heal them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And he marvelled because of their unbelief. And he went among the villages, teaching.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And he called to him the twelve, and began to send them forth two by two; and gave them authority over unclean spirits;</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="12">And they went out, and preached that men should repent.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And they cast out many devils, and anointed with oil many who were sick, and healed them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And King Herod heard of it; (for his name was spread abroad). And some said that John the Baptist had risen from the dead, and therefore mighty works showed themselves forth in him.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="16">But when Herod heard of it, he said, It is John, whom I beheaded: he has risen from the dead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">For Herod himself had John arrested, and bound him in prison because of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife: for he had married her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">For John had said to Herod, It is not lawful for you to have your brother's wife.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Therefore Herodias had a grudge against him, and would have killed him; but she could not:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">For Herod feared John, knowing that he was a just and holy man, and kept him safe; and when he heard him, he was perplexed, but he enjoyed listening to him.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="25">And she came immediately in haste to the king, and asked, saying, I want you to give me right now the head of John the Baptist on a platter.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">The king was exceedingly sorry; yet for his oath's sake, and for the sake of those who sat with him, he would not refuse her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">So immediately the king sent an executioner with orders that his head be brought. He went and beheaded him in the prison,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="29">And when his disciples heard of it, they came and took his body, and laid it in a tomb.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And the apostles gathered together with Jesus, and told him all things, both what they had done, and what they had taught.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">And he said to them, Come by yourselves to a lonely place, and rest a while: for there were many coming and going, and they had no leisure even to eat.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">And they departed privately by boat to a lonely place by themselves.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">And the people saw them departing, and many recognized them, and ran there on foot from all the cities, and got there before them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">And Jesus, when he came ashore, saw many people, and was moved with compassion for them, because they were like sheep without a shepherd: and he began to teach them many things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">And when the day was almost gone, his disciples came to him, and said, This is a lonely place, and it is very late:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">Send them away, that they may go into the country round about, and into the villages, and buy bread for themselves: for they have nothing to eat.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">He answered and said to them, You give them something to eat. And they said to him, Shall we go and buy two hundred denarii of bread, and give it to them to eat?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">He said to them, How many loaves have you? go and see. And when they found out, they said, Five, and two fish.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="40">And they sat down in groups, by hundreds, and by fifties.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">And when he had taken the five loaves and the two fish, he looked up to heaven, and blessed and broke the loaves, and gave them to his disciples to set before them; and the two fish he divided among them all.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">And they all ate, and were filled.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">And they picked up twelve baskets full of the fragments, and of the fish.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">And there were about five thousand men who ate of the loaves.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">And immediately he made his disciples get into the boat and go ahead to the other side, to Bethsaida, while he sent the people away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">And when he had sent them away, he departed to a mountain to pray.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">And when evening had come, the boat was in the midst of the sea, and he was alone on the land.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">And he saw them toiling at their rowing; for the wind was against them: and about the fourth watch of the night he came to them, walking upon the sea, and would have passed them by.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">But when they saw him walking upon the sea, they supposed it was a ghost, and cried out:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">For they all saw him, and were troubled. And immediately he spoke with them, and said to them, Take heart: it is I; do not be afraid.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="51">And he joined them in the boat; and the wind ceased: and they were amazed beyond measure.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="52">For they did not understand the miracle of the loaves: for their hearts were hardened.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="53">And when they passed over, they came to the land of Gennesaret, and moored to the shore.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="54">And when they had come out of the boat, immediately people recognized him,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="55">And ran throughout that whole region, and began to carry the sick about on mats, to wherever they heard he was.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="56">And wherever he entered, into villages, or cities, or country, they laid the sick in the streets, and begged him that they might even touch the fringe of his garment: and as many as touched him were made well.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="7">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Then the Pharisees and some of the scribes, who came from Jerusalem, gathered around him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And when they saw some of his disciples eat bread with defiled, that is to say, with unwashed, hands, they found fault.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">(For the Pharisees, and all the Jews, do not eat unless they wash their hands, thus holding to the tradition of the elders.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And when they come from the market, unless they wash, they do not eat. And there are many other traditions which they observe, such as the washing of cups, and pots, and vessels of copper.)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Then the Pharisees and scribes asked him, Why do your disciples not walk according to the tradition of the elders, but rather eat bread with unwashed hands?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">He answered and said to them, Well has Isaiah prophesied of you hypocrites, as it is written, This people honours me with their lips, but their hearts are far from me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">In vain do they worship me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Laying aside the commandment of God, you hold to the traditions of men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And he said to them, You fully reject the commandment of God, that you may keep your own tradition.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">For Moses said, Honour your father and your mother; and, Whoever curses father or mother, let him be put to death:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">But you say, If a man shall say to his father or mother, whatever I have that might benefit you is Corban, that is to say, a gift to God,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Then you do not allow him to do anything for his father or his mother;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Thus making the word of God invalid through your tradition, which you have handed down: and you do many such things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And when he had called all the people to him, he said to them, Listen to me, every one of you, and understand:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">There is nothing from outside of a man that can defile him by entering into him: but the things which come out of him, those are the things that defile the man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">[If any man has ears to hear, let him hear.]</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And when he entered into the house and left the people, his disciples asked him about the parable.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And he said to them, Are you also without understanding? Do you not perceive, that whatever enters into the man from without, it cannot defile him;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Because it does not enter into his heart, but into the belly, and is eliminated? Thus he declared all foods clean.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And he said, That which comes out of the man, that defiles the man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">For from within, out of the heart of men, proceed evil thoughts, sexual immorality, theft, murder, adultery,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Covetousness, wickedness, deceit, lustfulness, envy, slander, pride, foolishness:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">All these evil things come from within, and defile the man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And from there he arose, and went into the regions of Tyre, and entered into a house, and would not have anyone know it: but he could not be hidden.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">But a certain woman, whose young daughter had an unclean spirit, heard of him, and came and fell at his feet:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">The woman was a Greek, a Syrophoenician by birth; and she begged him that he would cast forth the devil out of her daughter.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">But Jesus said to her, Let the children first be filled: for it is not right to take the children's bread, and to cast it to the dogs.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And she answered and said to him, Yes, Lord: but even the dogs under the table eat the children's crumbs.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And he said to her, For this answer go your way; the devil has gone out of your daughter.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And when she came to her house, she found the devil gone, and her daughter lying upon the bed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">And again, departing from the region of Tyre, through Sidon, he came to the sea of Galilee, in the region of Decapolis.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">And they brought to him one who was deaf, and had an impediment in his speech; and they begged him to put his hand upon him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">And he took him aside from the multitude, and put his fingers into his ears, and he spit, and touched his tongue;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">And looking up to heaven, he sighed, and said to him, Ephphatha, that is, Be opened.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">And immediately his ears were opened, and the impediment of his tongue was loosened, and he spoke plainly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">And he commanded them that they should tell no man: but the more he commanded them, the more widely they proclaimed it;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">And they were astonished beyond measure, saying, He has done all things well: he makes both the deaf to hear, and the dumb to speak.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="8">
      <VERS vnumber="1">In those days another great multitude gathered, and as they had nothing to eat, Jesus called his disciples to him, and said to them,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">I have compassion on the multitude, because they have now been with me three days, and have nothing to eat:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And if I send them away fasting to their own houses, they will faint on the way: for some of them came from afar.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And his disciples answered him, Where can a man find enough bread to satisfy these men here in the wilderness?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And he asked them, How many loaves do you have? And they said, Seven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And he commanded the people to sit down on the ground: and he took the seven loaves, and gave thanks, and broke them, and gave them to his disciples to set before them; and they set them before the people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And they had a few small fish: which he blessed, and commanded to be set before them as well.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">So they ate, and were filled: and of the broken pieces that were left over they picked up seven baskets.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And there were about four thousand people: and he sent them away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And immediately he entered into a boat with his disciples, and went to the district of Dalmanutha.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And the Pharisees came forth, and began to question him, seeking from him a sign from heaven, testing him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And he sighed deeply in his spirit, and said, Why does this generation seek after a sign? truly I say to you, There shall be no sign given to this generation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And he left them, and entering into the boat again departed to the other side.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Now the disciples had forgotten to take bread, and did not have in the boat with them more than one loaf.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And he charged them, saying, Take heed, beware of the leaven of the Pharisees, and the leaven of Herod.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And they discussed among themselves, saying, It is because we have no bread.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And being aware of this, Jesus said to them, Why do you discuss having no bread? do you not yet see or understand? are your hearts hardened?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Having eyes, do you not see? and having ears, do you not hear? and do you not remember?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">When I broke the five loaves among five thousand, how many baskets full of fragments did you pick up? They said to him, Twelve.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And when I broke the seven among four thousand, how many baskets full of fragments did you pick up? And they said, Seven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And he said to them, How is it that you do not understand?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And he came to Bethsaida; and they brought a blind man to him, and begged him to touch him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And he took the blind man by the hand, and led him out of the village; and when he had spit on his eyes, and put his hands upon him, he asked him if he saw anything.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And he looked up, and said, I see men as trees, walking.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">After that he put his hands again upon his eyes, and made him look up: and he was restored, and saw everything clearly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And he sent him away to his house, saying, Do not go into the village.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And Jesus went out, with his disciples, to the villages of Caesarea Philippi: and on the way he asked his disciples, saying to them, Who do men say that I am?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And they answered, John the Baptist: but some say, Elijah; and others, One of the prophets.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And he said to them, But who do you say that I am? And Peter answered and said to him, You are the Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And he commanded them that they should tell no man about him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">And he began to teach them, that the Son of man must suffer many things, and be rejected by the elders, and by the chief priests, and scribes, and be killed, and after three days rise again.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">And he spoke this plainly. And Peter took him aside, and began to rebuke him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">But when he had turned about and looked at his disciples, he rebuked Peter, saying, Get behind me, Satan: for you do not have in mind the things of God, but the things that are of men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">And when he had called the people to him, with his disciples also, he said to them, Whoever would come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">For whoever would save his life shall lose it; but whoever shall lose his life for my sake and the gospel's, shall save it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">For what does it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">Or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">Therefore, whoever shall be ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation; of him also shall the Son of man be ashamed, when he comes in the glory of his Father with the holy angels.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">And his clothing became shining and exceedingly white; as no fuller on earth could whiten them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And there appeared to them Elijah with Moses: and they were talking with Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And Peter answered and said to Jesus, Rabbi, it is good for us to be here: let us make three tabernacles; one for you, and one for Moses, and one for Elijah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">For he did not know what to say; for they were very afraid.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And there was a cloud that overshadowed them: and a voice came out of the cloud, saying, This is my beloved Son: hear him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And suddenly, when they looked around, they saw no man with them, except Jesus only.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And as they came down from the mountain, he commanded them that they should tell no man the things they had seen, until the Son of man should have risen from the dead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And they kept that saying to themselves, questioning one with another what rising from the dead might mean.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And they asked him, saying, Why do the scribes say that Elijah must come first?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And he answered them, Elijah truly comes first, and restores all things; and how is it written of the Son of man, that he must suffer many things, and be treated with contempt?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">But I say to you, That Elijah has indeed come, and they have done to him whatever they pleased, as it is written of him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And when he came to his disciples, he saw a great multitude about them, and the scribes arguing with them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And immediately all the people, when they beheld him, were greatly amazed, and ran to greet him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And he asked the scribes, What are you discussing with them?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And one of the multitude answered and said, Teacher, I have brought to you my son, who has a dumb spirit;</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="20">And they brought him to him: and when he saw him, immediately the spirit tore him; and he fell on the ground, and rolled around foaming at the mouth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And he asked his father, How long has this been happening to him? And he said, Since he was a child.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And often it has cast him into the fire, and into the waters, to destroy him: but if you can do anything, have compassion on us, and help us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Jesus said to him, If you can! all things are possible to him who believes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And immediately the father of the child cried out, and said, Lord, I believe; help me overcome my unbelief.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">When Jesus saw that the people came running together, he rebuked the foul spirit, saying to him, You dumb and deaf spirit, I command you, come out of him, and do not enter into him again.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And the spirit cried out, and threw him into severe convulsions, and came out of him: and he was like a corpse; so that many said, He is dead.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="32">And they were on the way up to Jerusalem; and Jesus went before them: and they were amazed; and as they followed, they were afraid. And again he took the twelve aside, and began to tell them the things that would happen to him,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">Saying, Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem; and the Son of man shall be delivered to the chief priests, and to the scribes; and they shall condemn him to death, and shall deliver him to the Gentiles:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">And they shall mock him, and shall scourge him, and shall spit upon him, and shall kill him: and the third day he shall rise again.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">And James and John, the sons of Zebedee, came to him, saying, Teacher, we want you to do for us whatever we ask.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">And he said to them, What do you want me to do for you?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">They said to him, Grant to us that we may sit, one on your right hand, and the other on your left hand, in your glory.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">But Jesus said to them, You do not know what you are asking: can you drink of the cup that I drink? or be baptized with the baptism with which I am baptized?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">And they said to him, We can. And Jesus said to them, You shall indeed drink of the cup that I drink; and be baptized with the baptism with which I am baptized:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">But to sit on my right hand and on my left hand is not mine to give; but it shall be given to those for whom it is prepared.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">And when the ten heard it, they began to be very displeased with James and John.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">But Jesus called them to him, and said to them, You know that those who are regarded as rulers over the Gentiles lord it over them; and their great ones exercise authority over them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">But it shall not be so among you: but whoever wishes to be great among you, shall be your servant:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">And whoever wants to be the first among you, shall be the slave of all.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">For even the Son of man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give his life a ransom for many.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">And they came to Jericho: and as he went out of Jericho with his disciples and a great number of people, blind Bartimaeus, the son of Timaeus, sat by the highway begging.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">And when he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth, he began to cry out, and say, Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">And many commanded him to hold his peace: but he cried out all the more, Son of David, have mercy on me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">And Jesus stood still, and commanded him to be called. And they called the blind man, saying to him, Take courage, arise; he calls you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">And he cast away his cloak, arose, and came to Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="51">And Jesus said to him, What do you want that I should do for you? The blind man said to him, Master, I want to receive my sight.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="52">And Jesus said to him, Go your way; your faith has made you well. And immediately he received his sight, and followed Jesus along the way.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">And when they came near to Jerusalem, to Bethphage and Bethany, at the mount of Olives, he sent forth two of his disciples,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="4">And they went their way, and found the colt tied outside in the street by a door; and they untied it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And some of those who stood there said to them, What are you doing, untying the colt?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And they said to them what Jesus had commanded: and they let them go.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="13">And seeing a fig tree far off with leaves, he went to it, to see if he might find something on it: and when he came to it, he found nothing but leaves; for it was not the season for figs.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">And he began to speak to them in parables. A certain man planted a vineyard, and set a hedge about it, and dug a place for the winepress, and built a tower, and rented it out to farmers, and went to a far country.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And at harvest time he sent a servant to the farmers, that he might receive from them some of the fruit of the vineyard.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">But they caught him, and beat him, and sent him away empty-handed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And he sent to them another servant; and they wounded him in the head, and treated him shamefully.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And he sent another; but they killed him, and so they did to many others; beating some, and killing some.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Having yet one more to send, his well-beloved son, he sent him last of all to them, saying, They will respect my son.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">But the farmers said to themselves, This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and the inheritance shall be ours.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="11">This was the Lord's doing, and it is marvellous in our eyes?</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="13">And they sent to him some of the Pharisees and Herodians, to catch him in his words.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And when they had come, they said to him, Teacher, we know that you are truthful, and defer to no man: for you do not regard the position of men, but teach the way of God in truth: Is it lawful to pay taxes to Caesar, or not?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Shall we pay, or shall we not pay? But he, knowing their hypocrisy, said to them, Why are you testing me? bring me a denarius, that I may see it.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="18">Then the Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection, came to him, and they questioned him, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Teacher, Moses wrote for us, If a man's brother dies, and leaves his wife, but leaves no child, his brother should take his wife, and raise up children for his brother.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Now there were seven brothers: and the first took a wife, and died, leaving no child.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="23">Therefore, in the resurrection, when they shall rise, which one's wife shall she be? for all seven had her as wife.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Jesus answered them, Is this not the reason you err, because you do not know the scriptures or the power of God?</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="31">And the second is this, You shall love your neighbour as yourself. There is no other commandment greater than these.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">And the scribe said to him, Well said, Teacher, you have spoken the truth: for there is one God; and there is none other but he:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">And to love him with all the heart, and with all the understanding, and with all the soul, and with all the strength, and to love one's neighbour as oneself, is more than all burnt offerings and sacrifices.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="35">And while he taught in the temple, Jesus said, How is it that the scribes say that the Christ is the Son of David?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">For David himself said by the Holy Spirit, The LORD said to my Lord, Sit on my right hand, until I put your enemies under your feet.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">Therefore, David himself calls him Lord; so how can he be his son? And the great crowd heard him gladly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">And in his teaching he said to them, Beware of the scribes, who love to go about in long clothing, and love greetings in the marketplaces,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">And the chief seats in the synagogues, and places of honour at feasts:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">They devour widows' houses, and for a pretence make long prayers: these shall receive greater condemnation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">And Jesus sat across from the treasury, and watched how the people put money into the treasury: and many who were rich cast in much.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">And a certain poor widow came, and she put in two small copper coins, which make a farthing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">And he called his disciples to him, and said to them, Truly I say to you, That this poor widow has put more into the treasury than all the others:</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">And as he went out of the temple, one of his disciples said to him, Teacher, see what wonderful stones and buildings!</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">And as he sat upon the mount of Olives across from the temple, Peter and James and John and Andrew asked him privately,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="48">And Jesus said to them, Have you come out, as against a thief, with swords and clubs to take me?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">I was with you daily in the temple teaching, and you did not seize me: but the scriptures must be fulfilled.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">And they all forsook him, and fled.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="51">And a certain young man followed him, having a linen cloth wrapped around his naked body; and they laid hold on him:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="52">But he left the linen cloth, and fled from them naked.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="53">And they led Jesus away to the high priest: and all the chief priests and the elders and the scribes were assembled.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="54">And Peter followed him from afar, even into the courtyard of the high priest: and he sat with the servants, and warmed himself at the fire.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="55">And the chief priests and all the council sought for testimony against Jesus to put him to death; but found none.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="56">For many bore false witness against him, but their testimonies did not agree.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="57">And some arose, and bore false witness against him, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="58">We heard him say, I will destroy this temple that is made with hands, and within three days I will build another made without hands.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="59">But even then their testimonies did not agree.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="60">And the high priest stood up in the midst, and asked Jesus, Have you no answer? what is it that these men are testifying against you?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="61">But he held his peace, and said nothing. Again the high priest asked him, Are you the Christ, the Son of the Blessed One?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="62">And Jesus said, I am: and you shall see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="63">Then the high priest tore his clothes, and said, Why do we need any further witnesses?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="64">You have heard the blasphemy: what do you think? And they all condemned him as worthy of death.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="65">And some began to spit on him, and to cover his face, and to strike him, and to say to him, Prophesy: and as the guards took him they beat him with their fists.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="66">And as Peter was below in the courtyard, one of the maids of the high priest came:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="67">And when she saw Peter warming himself, she looked at him, and said, You also were with Jesus of Nazareth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="68">But he denied it, saying, I do not know or understand what you are saying. And he went out into the entryway.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="69">And the maid saw him again, and began to say to those who stood by, This is one of them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="70">And he denied it again. And a little later, those who stood nearby again said to Peter, Surely you are one of them: for you are also a Galilaean.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="71">But he began to curse and to swear, saying, I do not know this man of whom you speak.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="72">And the second time the cock crowed. And Peter remembered that Jesus said to him, Before the cock crows twice, you shall deny me three times. And when he remembered this, he wept.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="15">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And immediately in the morning the chief priests held a consultation with the elders and scribes and the whole council, and bound Jesus, and carried him away, and delivered him to Pilate.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And Pilate asked him, Are you the King of the Jews? And he said to him, You say so.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And the chief priests accused him of many things: but he answered nothing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And Pilate asked him again, saying, Have you no answer to make? behold how many things they testify against you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">But Jesus made no further answer; so that Pilate was amazed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Now at the feast he released to them one prisoner, whomever they requested.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And there was one named Barabbas, who was in prison with his fellow rebels, who had committed murder in the insurrection.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And the multitude approached and began asking him to do for them as he usually did.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Pilate answered them, saying, Do you want me to release for you the King of the Jews?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">For he knew that the chief priests had delivered him out of envy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">But the chief priests incited the people to have him release Barabbas to them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And Pilate answered and said again to them, What then shall I do with him whom you call the King of the Jews?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And they cried out again, Crucify him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Then Pilate said to them, Why, what evil has he done? And they cried out all the louder, Crucify him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And so Pilate, wanting to satisfy the people, released Barabbas to them, and delivered Jesus, when he had scourged him, to be crucified.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And the soldiers led him away into the hall, called the Praetorium; and they called together the whole band of soldiers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And they clothed him with purple, and weaved a crown of thorns, and put it on him,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="19">And they struck him on the head with a cane, and spat upon him, and bowed their knees in worship to him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And when they had mocked him, they took the purple off of him, and put his own clothes on him, and led him out to crucify him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And they compelled Simon, a Cyrenian who was passing by on his way in from the country, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to bear his cross.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And they brought him to the place called Golgotha, which means, The place of a skull.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="31">Likewise, the chief priests mocked him among themselves and with the scribes, He saved others; but he cannot save himself.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">Let Christ, the King of Israel, descend now from the cross, that we may see and believe. And those who were crucified with him also reviled him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">And when the sixth hour had come, there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">And at the ninth hour Jesus cried out with a loud voice, saying, Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani? which means, My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">And some of those who stood by, when they heard it, said, Behold, he is calling Elijah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">And one ran and filled a sponge full of vinegar, and put it on a reed, and gave it to him to drink, saying, Wait; let us see whether Elijah will come to take him down.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">And Jesus cried out with a loud voice, and breathed his last.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">And the veil of the temple was torn in two from the top to the bottom.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Since many have undertaken to set forth in order a narrative of those things which have happened among us,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Just as they have been delivered to us, by those who from the beginning were eyewitnesses, and ministers of the word;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">It seemed good to me also, having carefully investigated all these things from the very beginning, to write to you an orderly account, most excellent Theophilus,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">That you might know the certainty of those things, about which you have been instructed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">There was in the days of Herod, the king of Judaea, a certain priest named Zechariah, of the division of Abija: and his wife was one of the daughters of Aaron, and her name was Elizabeth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And they were both righteous before God, walking blamelessly in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And they had no child, because Elizabeth was barren, and they were both now well along in years.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And it came to pass, that while he executed the priest's service before God while his division was on duty,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">According to the custom of the priest's office, he was chosen by lot to enter the temple of the Lord and burn incense.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And the whole multitude of people were praying outside at the time of incense offering.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And there appeared to him an angel of the Lord standing on the right side of the altar of incense.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And when Zechariah saw him, he was troubled, and fear came upon him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">But the angel said to him, Fear not, Zechariah: for your prayer has been heard; and your wife Elizabeth shall bear you a son, and you shall call his name John.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And you shall have joy and gladness; and many shall rejoice at his birth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">For he shall be great in the sight of the Lord, and shall drink neither wine nor strong drink; and he shall be filled with the Holy Spirit, even from his mother's womb.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And he shall turn many of the children of Israel to the Lord their God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And he shall go before him in the spirit and power of Elijah, to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just; to make ready a people prepared for the Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And Zechariah said to the angel, How shall I know this? for I am an old man, and my wife is well along in years.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And the angel answered him, I am Gabriel, who stands in the presence of God; and have been sent to speak to you, and to bring you this good news.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Behold, you shall be silent, unable to speak, until the day that these things come to pass, because you have not believed my words, which shall be fulfilled in their time.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And the people waited for Zechariah, and wondered why he delayed so long in the temple.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And when he came out, he could not speak to them: and they realized that he had seen a vision in the temple: for he beckoned to them, and remained speechless.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And it came to pass, that, as soon as the days of his service were finished, he departed to his own house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And after those days his wife Elizabeth conceived, and hid herself five months, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Thus has the Lord dealt with me in the days when he looked on me, to take away my disgrace among men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God to a city of Galilee, named Nazareth,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">To a virgin engaged to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David; and the virgin's name was Mary.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And the angel came to her, and said, Hail, you who are highly favoured, the Lord is with you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And she was troubled at his words, and wondered what kind of greeting this might be.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And the angel said to her, Fear not, Mary, for you have found favour with God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">And behold, you shall conceive in your womb, and bring forth a son, and shall call his name JESUS.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Most High: and the Lord God shall give to him the throne of his father David:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">And he shall reign over the house of Jacob forever; and of his kingdom there shall be no end.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Then Mary said to the angel, How shall this be, since I am a virgin?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">And the angel answered her, The Holy Spirit shall come upon you, and the power of the Most High shall overshadow you: therefore the holy child to be born shall be called the Son of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">And, behold, your cousin Elizabeth has also conceived a son in her old age: and she who was called barren is in her sixth month.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">For with God nothing shall be impossible.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">And Mary said, Behold, I am the handmaid of the Lord; let it be to me according to your word. And the angel departed from her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">And at that time Mary arose, and went into the hill country with haste, into a city of Judah;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">And entered into the house of Zechariah, and greeted Elizabeth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">And it came to pass, that, when Elizabeth heard Mary's greeting, the baby leaped in her womb; and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">And she spoke out with a loud voice, and said, Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the fruit of your womb.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">And why do I deserve to have the mother of my Lord come to me?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">For, lo, as soon as the voice of your greeting sounded in my ears, the baby leaped in my womb for joy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">And blessed is she who believed that those things which were told her from the Lord would be fulfilled.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">And Mary said, My soul magnifies the Lord,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">And my spirit rejoices in God my Saviour.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">For he has looked upon the low estate of his handmaiden: for, behold, from henceforth all generations shall call me blessed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">For he who is mighty has done great things for me; and holy is his name.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">And his mercy is on those who fear him from generation to generation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="51">He has shown strength with his arm; he has scattered those who were proud in the imagination of their hearts.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="52">He has put down the mighty from their thrones, and exalted the humble.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="53">He has filled the hungry with good things; and the rich he has sent away empty.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="54">He has helped his servant Israel, in remembrance of his mercy;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="55">As he spoke to our fathers, to Abraham, and to his seed forever.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="56">And Mary remained with her about three months, and returned to her own house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="57">Now the time came for Elizabeth to give birth; and she brought forth a son.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="58">And her neighbours and her cousins heard how the Lord had shown great mercy upon her; and they rejoiced with her.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="61">And they said to her, There is no one of your family who is called by this name.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="62">And they made signs to his father, what he would have him called.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="63">And he asked for a writing tablet, and wrote, His name is John. And they all marvelled.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="64">And his mouth was opened immediately, and his tongue loosed, and he spoke, and praised God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="65">And fear came upon all who lived around them: and all these things were spoken of throughout all the hill country of Judaea.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="66">And all who heard them laid them up in their hearts, saying, What shall this child shall turn out to be! And the hand of the Lord was with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="67">And his father Zechariah was filled with the Holy Spirit, and prophesied, saying,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="76">And you, child, shall be called the prophet of the Most High: for you shall go before the face of the Lord to prepare his ways;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="77">To give to his people the knowledge of salvation by the forgiveness of their sins;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="78">Through the tender mercy of our God, the sunrise from on high will visit us,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="8">Jesus answered him, It is written, You shall worship the Lord your God, and him only shall you serve.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And he brought him to Jerusalem, and set him on a pinnacle of the temple, and said to him, If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down from here:</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="40">Now when the sun was setting, all those who had any sick with various diseases brought them to him; and he laid his hands on every one of them, and healed them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">And devils also came out of many, crying out, and saying, You are the Son of God. And he rebuked them and did not allow them to speak: for they knew that he was the Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">And when it was day, he departed and went into a lonely place: and the people sought him, and came to him, and tried to keep him from leaving them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">But he said to them, I must preach the kingdom of God to other cities also: for I was sent for that purpose.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="5">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And it came to pass, that, as the people pressed upon him to hear the word of God, he was standing by the lake of Gennesaret,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">And he got into one of the boats, which was Simon's, and asked him to put out a little from the land. And he sat down, and taught the people from the boat.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Now when he finished speaking, he said to Simon, Put out into the deep, and let down your nets for a catch.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And Simon answered him, Master, we have toiled all night, and have caught nothing: nevertheless at your word I will let down the net.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And when they had done this, they enclosed a great multitude of fish: and their net began to break.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And they beckoned to their partners, who were in the other boat, that they should come and help them. And they came, and filled both the boats, so that they began to sink.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">When Simon Peter saw it, he fell down at Jesus' knees, saying, Depart from me; for I am a sinful man, O Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">For he was astonished, and all who were with him, at the catch of fish which they had taken:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And so were James, and John, the sons of Zebedee, who were partners with Simon. And Jesus said to Simon, Fear not; from now on you shall catch men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And when they had brought their boats to land, they left everything, and followed him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And it came to pass, when he was in a certain city, there came a man full of leprosy; who, seeing Jesus, fell on his face and begged him, saying, Lord, if you will, you can make me clean.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And he put forth his hand, and touched him, saying, I will: be clean. And immediately the leprosy departed from him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And he ordered him to tell no man: But go, and show yourself to the priest, and make an offering for your cleansing, as Moses commanded, as a testimony to them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">But his fame was spread abroad so much the more: and great multitudes came together to hear, and to be healed by him of their infirmities.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And he withdrew into the wilderness, and prayed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And it came to pass on a certain day, as he was teaching, that there were Pharisees and doctors of the law sitting there, who had come out of every town of Galilee, and Judaea, and Jerusalem: and the power of the Lord was present for him to heal.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And, behold, men brought a man on a mat who was paralysed: and they sought to bring him in, and to lay him before him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And when they could not find a way to bring him in because of the multitude, they went up on the roof, and let him down through the tiling with his mat into the midst of the crowd in front of Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And when he saw their faith, he said to him, Man, your sins are forgiven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And the scribes and the Pharisees began to reason, saying, Who is this who speaks blasphemies? Who can forgive sins, but God alone?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">But Jesus, aware of their thoughts, answered and said to them, Why do you question in your hearts?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Which is easier, to say, Your sins are forgiven; or to say, Rise up and walk?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">But that you may know that the Son of man has power upon earth to forgive sins, (he said to the paralytic,) I say to you, Arise, and take up your mat, and go to your house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And immediately he rose up before them, and took up what he had been lying on, and departed to his house, glorifying God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And they were all amazed, and they glorified God, and were filled with fear, saying, We have seen strange things today.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And after these things he went forth, and saw a tax gatherer, named Levi, sitting at the tax office; and he said to him, Follow me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And he left all, rose up, and followed him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And Levi made a great feast in his own house for him: and there was a great company of tax gatherers and of others who were reclining at table with them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">But the scribes and Pharisees murmured against his disciples, saying, Why do you eat and drink with tax gatherers and sinners?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">And Jesus answered and said to them, Those who are well do not need a physician; but those who are sick.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">And they said to him, Why do the disciples of John fast often, and make prayers, and likewise the disciples of the Pharisees; but yours eat and drink?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">And he said to them, Can you make the wedding guests fast, while the bridegroom is with them?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">But the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them, and then they shall fast in those days.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">And he also spoke a parable to them; No man puts a piece of a new garment upon an old garment; if he does, then the new garment is torn, and the piece that was taken out of the new garment does not match the old.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">And no man puts new wine into old wineskins; if he does the new wine will burst the skins, and be spilled, and the skins will be ruined.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">But new wine must be put into new skins; then both are preserved.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="33">And if you do good to those who do good to you, what credit is that to you? for sinners also do the same.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">And if you lend to those from whom you hope to receive, what credit is that to you? for sinners also lend to sinners to receive repayment.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">But love your enemies, and do good, and lend, expecting nothing back; and your reward shall be great, and you shall be the children of the Most High: for he is kind to the unthankful and to the evil.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">Be merciful, as your Father also is merciful.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">Do not judge, and you shall not be judged: do not condemn, and you shall not be condemned: forgive, and you shall be forgiven:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">Give, and it shall be given to you; a good measure, pressed down, shaken together, and running over, shall men put in your lap. For the measure you give to others shall be the same measure given back to you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">And he spoke a parable to them, Can the blind lead the blind? shall they not both fall into the ditch?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">The disciple is not above his teacher: but every one who is fully trained shall be like his teacher.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">And why do you look at the speck in your brother's eye, but do not perceive the beam that is in your own eye?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">Or how can you say to your brother, Brother, let me pull out the speck that is in your eye, when you do not even see the beam that is in your own eye? You hypocrite, first take the beam out of your own eye, and then you shall see clearly to pull out the speck that is in your brother's eye.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">For a good tree does not bring forth bad fruit; nor does a bad tree bring forth good fruit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">For every tree is known by its fruit. For men do not gather figs from thorn bushes, nor do they gather grapes from a bramble bush.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">A good man out of the good treasure of his heart brings forth that which is good; and an evil man out of the evil treasure of his heart brings forth that which is evil: for from the overflow of the heart his mouth speaks.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">And why do you call me, Lord, Lord, and do not do the things which I say?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">I will show you what he is like who comes to me, and hears my words, and does them:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">He is like a man who built a house, and dug deep, and laid the foundation on a rock: and when the flood arose, the river beat violently upon that house, but could not shake it: for it was founded upon a rock.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">But he who hears, and does not obey, is like a man who built a house upon the ground without a foundation; and the river beat violently against it, and immediately it fell; and the ruin of that house was great.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="7">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now when he finished saying all this in the hearing of the people, he entered Capernaum.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And a certain centurion's slave, who was dear to him, was sick, and ready to die.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And when he heard of Jesus, he sent the elders of the Jews to him, begging him to come and heal his servant.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And when they came to Jesus, they begged him earnestly, saying, He is worthy to have you do this for him:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">For he loves our nation, and he has built us a synagogue.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Then Jesus went with them. And when he was not far from the house, the centurion sent friends to him, saying to him, Lord, do not trouble yourself: for I am not worthy to have you come under my roof:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Nor did I think myself worthy to come to you: but say the word, and my servant shall be healed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">For I also am a man under authority, having under me soldiers; and I say to one, Go, and he goes, and to another, Come, and he comes, and to my servant, Do this, and he does it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">When Jesus heard these things, he marvelled at him, and turned and said to the people who followed him, I say to you, I have not found such great faith even in Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And those who were sent, returned to the house, and found the slave well.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And it came to pass the day after, that he went into a city called Nain; and many of his disciples went with him, as did many people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Now when he came near to the gate of the city, behold, there was a dead man being carried out, the only son of his mother, and she was a widow: and many people from the city were with her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And when the Lord saw her, he had compassion on her, and said to her, Do not weep.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And he came and touched the coffin, and those who bore it stood still. And he said, Young man, I say to you, Arise.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And the dead man sat up, and began to speak. And he gave him back to his mother.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And fear came upon them all: and they glorified God, saying, A great prophet is risen up among us; and, God has visited his people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And this report of him went forth throughout all Judaea, and throughout all the surrounding region.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And the disciples of John told him of all these things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And John, calling to him two of his disciples, sent them to Jesus, saying, Are you he who is to come? or should we look for another?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">When the men had come to him, they said, John the Baptist has sent us to you, saying, Are you he who is to come? or should we look for another?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And in that same hour he cured many people of their diseases and afflictions, and of evil spirits; and to many who were blind he gave sight.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Then Jesus answered and said to them, Go your way, and tell John the things you have seen and heard; how the blind see, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, and the gospel is preached to the poor.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And blessed is he who does not stumble over me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And when the messengers of John departed, he began to speak to the people about John: What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken by the wind?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">But what did you go out to see? A man dressed in soft clothing? Behold, those who are gorgeously dressed, and live luxuriously, are in kings' courts.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">But what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I say to you, and much more than a prophet.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">This is he, of whom it is written, Behold, I send my messenger before your face, who shall prepare your way before you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">For I say to you, Among those born of women there is none greater than John: but he who is least in the kingdom of God is greater than he.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And all the people who heard him, and the tax gatherers, acknowledged the ways of God were just, for they had been baptized with the baptism of John.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">But the Pharisees and lawyers rejected the purpose of God for themselves, not having been baptized by him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">And the Lord said, To what shall I compare the men of this generation? and what are they like?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">They are like children sitting in the marketplace, and calling one to another, and saying, We played the pipes for you, and you did not dance; we sang a dirge for you, and you did not weep.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">For John the Baptist came neither eating bread nor drinking wine; and you say, He has a devil.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">The Son of man comes eating and drinking; and you say, Behold a gluttonous man, and a drunkard, a friend of tax gatherers and sinners!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">But wisdom is justified by all her children.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">And one of the Pharisees asked him to eat with him. And he went into the Pharisee's house, and reclined at table.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">And, behold, a woman of the city, who was a sinner, when she learned that Jesus was at table in the Pharisee's house, brought an alabaster vial of perfume,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">And stood at his feet behind him weeping, and began to wash his feet with tears, and wiped them with the hair of her head, and kissed his feet, and anointed them with the perfume.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">Now when the Pharisee who had invited him saw this, he said to himself, This man, if he were a prophet, would have known who and what manner of woman this is who touches him: for she is a sinner.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">And Jesus answered him, Simon, I have something to say to you. And he said, Say it, Teacher.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">There was a certain creditor who had two debtors: the one owed five hundred denarii, and the other fifty.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">And when they were unable to repay, he freely forgave them both. Now, which of them will love him most?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">Simon answered, I suppose the one whom he forgave the most. And he said to him, You have judged correctly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">And he turned to the woman, and said to Simon, Do you see this woman? I entered your house: you gave me no water for my feet, but she has washed my feet with tears, and wiped them with her hair.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">You gave me no kiss: but since I came in this woman has not ceased to kiss my feet.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">You did not anoint my head with oil: but this woman has anointed my feet with perfume.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">Therefore I say to you, Her sins, which are many, are forgiven; for she loved much: but he who is forgiven little, loves little.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">And he said to her, Your sins are forgiven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">And those who reclined at table with him began to say among themselves, Who is this who even forgives sins?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">And he said to the woman, Your faith has saved you; go in peace.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="8">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And it came to pass soon after, that he went through cities and villages, preaching and bringing the glad news of the kingdom of God. And the twelve were with him,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Along with certain women who had been healed of evil spirits and infirmities: Mary of Magdala, out of whom seven devils had gone out,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And Joanna, the wife of Chuza, Herod's steward, and Susanna, and many others, who helped support them out of their own means.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And when many people were gathered together, and came to him from town after town, he spoke in a parable:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">A sower went out to sow his seed: and as he sowed, some fell by the wayside; and it was trodden down, and the birds of the air devoured it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And some fell upon the rock; and as soon as it had sprung up, it withered away, because it lacked moisture.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And some fell among thorns; and the thorns sprang up with it, and choked it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And other fell on good ground, and sprang up, and bore a crop a hundred times as great. And when he said these things, he called out, He who has ears to hear, let him hear.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And his disciples asked him, What does this parable mean?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And he said, To you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God: but to others it is in parables; that seeing they might not see, and hearing they might not understand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Now the meaning of the parable is this: The seed is the word of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Those by the wayside are the ones who hear; then the devil comes, and takes the word from their hearts, lest they should believe and be saved.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Those on the rock are the ones, who, when they hear, receive the word with joy; but they have no root; they believe for a while, but in time of temptation fall away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And the seed which fell among thorns are those, who, when they have heard, go forth, and are choked by the cares and riches and pleasures of this life, and bring no fruit to maturity.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">But the seed on the good ground are those, who in an honest and good heart, having heard the word, keep it, and bring forth fruit with patience.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">No man, when he has lighted a lamp, covers it with a container, or puts it under a bed; but sets it on a stand, that those who enter may see the light.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">For nothing is hidden, that shall not be disclosed; nor anything secret, that shall not be made known and come into the open.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Therefore, take heed how you listen: for whoever has, to him shall be given; and whoever has not, from him shall be taken even that which he seems to have.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Then his mother and brothers came to him, and could not reach him because of the crowd.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And he was told, Your mother and brothers are standing outside, wanting to see you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And he answered and said to them, My mother and my brothers are those who hear the word of God, and do it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Now it came to pass on a certain day, that he got into a boat with his disciples: and he said to them, Let us go over to the other side of the lake. And they launched forth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">But as they sailed he fell asleep: and a storm of wind came down upon the lake; and they were filling with water, and were in danger.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And they came to him, and woke him, saying, Master, Master, we are perishing. Then he arose, and rebuked the wind and the raging of the water: and they ceased, and there was a calm.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And he said to them, Where is your faith? And they were afraid and amazed, saying to one another, Who is this! for he commands even the winds and water, and they obey him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And they arrived at the country of the Gerasenes, which is across from Galilee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And when he stepped onto the land, he was met by a man from the city, who had devils, and for a long time had worn no clothes, nor did he live in a house, but in the tombs.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">When he saw Jesus, he cried out, and fell down before him, and with a loud voice said, What have I to do with you, Jesus, Son of God most high? I beg you, do not torment me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">(For he had commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the man. For often it had seized him: and though he was kept under guard, bound with chains and in fetters; he would break the bonds and be driven by the devil into the desert.)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And Jesus asked him, saying, What is your name? And he said, Legion: because many devils had entered into him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">And they begged him that he would not command them to go out into the abyss.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">Now there was a herd of many swine feeding there on the mountain: and they begged him to let them enter these. And he gave them permission.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">Then the devils went out of the man, and entered into the swine: and the herd ran violently down a steep place into the lake, and were drowned.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">When those who fed them saw what had happened, they fled, and went and told it in the city and in the country.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">Then they went out to see what had happened, and came to Jesus, and found the man from whom the devils had gone out sitting at the feet of Jesus, clothed, and in his right mind: and they were afraid.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">Those who saw it happen told them how he who was possessed by the devils was healed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">Then all the people from the region of the Gerasenes begged him to depart from them; for they were taken with great fear: and he got into the boat, and returned.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">Now the man out of whom the devils had gone begged to be with him: but Jesus sent him away, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">Return to your own house, and describe what great things God has done for you. And he went his way, and proclaimed throughout the whole city what great things Jesus had done for him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">And it came to pass, that when Jesus returned, the people welcomed him: for they were all waiting for him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">And, behold, there came a man named Jairus, a ruler of the synagogue: and he fell down at Jesus' feet, and begged him to come to his house:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">For he had only one daughter, about twelve years old, and she lay dying. But as he went the people crowded around him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">And a woman who had a flow of blood for twelve years, and could not be healed by anyone,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">Came up behind him, and touched the edge of his garment: and immediately the flow of blood stopped.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">And Jesus said, Who touched me? When they all denied it, Peter said, Master, the multitudes crowd and press around you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">And Jesus said, Somebody has touched me: for I know that power has gone out of me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">And when the woman saw that she had not escaped notice, she came trembling, fell down before him, and told him before all the people why she had touched him, and how she was immediately healed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">And he said to her, Daughter, your faith has made you well; go in peace.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">While he was speaking, a man came from the ruler of the synagogue's house, and said to him, Your daughter is dead; do not trouble the Teacher further.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">But when Jesus heard this, he said, Do not fear: only believe, and she shall be made well.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="51">And when he came into the house, he allowed no one to go in, except Peter, and James, and John, and the father and mother of the girl.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="52">And all wept, and bewailed her: but he said, Do not weep; she is not dead, but sleeps.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="53">And they laughed him to scorn, knowing that she was dead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="54">And he put them all out, and took her by the hand, and called, saying, Child, arise.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="55">And her spirit returned, and she arose immediately: and he commanded that she be given food.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="56">And her parents were astonished: but he directed them to tell no one what had happened.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="9">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Then he called the twelve together, and gave them power and authority over all devils, and to cure diseases.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And he sent them to preach the kingdom of God, and to heal the sick.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And he said to them, Take nothing for your journey, no staff, no bag, no bread, no money; not even an extra tunic.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And whatever house you enter, stay there until you leave the town.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And whoever will not receive you, when you go out of that town, shake off the dust from your feet as a testimony against them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And they departed, and went through the towns, preaching the gospel, and healing everywhere.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Now Herod the tetrarch heard of all that was happening: and he was perplexed, because it was said by some that John had been raised from the dead;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And by some, that Elijah had appeared; and by others, that one of the old prophets had risen again.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And Herod said, I beheaded John: but who is this of whom I hear such things? And he desired to see him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And the apostles, when they returned, told him all that they had done. And he took them, and went aside privately into the city of Bethsaida.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And the people, when they learned of it, followed him: and he received them, and spoke to them of the kingdom of God, and healed those who needed healing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And when the day began to wear away, the twelve came, and said to him, Send the crowd away, that they may go into the towns and country round about, and find lodging and food: for we are here in a remote place.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">But he said to them, You give them something to eat. And they said, We have no more than five loaves and two fish; unless we go and buy food for all these people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">For there were about five thousand men. And he said to his disciples, Make them sit down in groups of about fifty each.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And they did so, and made them all sit down.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Then he took the five loaves and the two fish, and looking up to heaven, he blessed them, and broke them, and gave them to the disciples to set before the multitude.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And they ate, and were all filled: and they picked up twelve baskets of broken pieces that remained.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And it came to pass, as he was alone praying, his disciples were with him: and he asked them, Who do the people say that I am?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">They answered, John the Baptist; but some say, Elijah; and others say that one of the old prophets has risen again.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">He said to them, But who do you say that I am? Peter answered, The Christ of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And he strictly warned them, and commanded them not to tell this to anyone;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Saying, The Son of man must suffer many things, and be rejected by the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be slain, and be raised on the third day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And he said to them all, If anyone will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross daily, and follow me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">For whoever will save his life shall lose it: but whoever will lose his life for my sake, he shall save it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">For what advantage is there for a man if he gains the whole world, and loses or forfeits himself?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">For whoever shall be ashamed of me and of my words, of him shall the Son of man be ashamed, when he shall come in his glory, and the glory of his Father, and of the holy angels.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">But I tell you truly, there are some standing here who shall not taste death until they see the kingdom of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And it came to pass about eight days after these teachings, he took Peter and John and James, and went up on a mountain to pray.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And as he prayed, the appearance of his face was altered, and his clothing became dazzling white.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And, behold, two men were talking with him, Moses and Elijah:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Who appeared in glory, and spoke of his departure, which he would accomplish at Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">But Peter and those who were with him were heavy with sleep: but when they were fully awake, they saw his glory, and the two men who stood with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">And it came to pass, as the two men departed from him, Peter said to Jesus, Master, it is good for us to be here: let us make three shelters; one for you, and one for Moses, and one for Elijah: but he did not know what he was saying.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">While he spoke, a cloud came and enveloped them: and they were afraid as they entered the cloud.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">And a voice came out of the cloud, saying, This is my Son, my Chosen: hear him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">And when the voice had spoken, they found Jesus was alone. And they kept quiet, and told no one in those days any of those things which they had seen.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">And it came to pass, that on the next day, when they had come down from the hill, many people met him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">And, behold, a man of the crowd cried out, saying, Teacher, I beg you, look upon my son: for he is my only child.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">And, lo, a spirit takes him, and he suddenly cries out; and it convulses him until he foams at the mouth, and it mauls him and hardly ever leaves him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">And I begged your disciples to cast it out; but they could not.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">And Jesus answered, O faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you, and endure you? Bring your son here.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">And as he was coming, the devil threw him down, and violently convulsed him. And Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, and healed the child, and gave him back to his father.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">And they were all amazed at the mighty power of God. But while they were all marvelling at everything Jesus did, he said to his disciples,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">Let these words sink down into your ears: the Son of man shall be delivered into the hands of men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">But they did not understand this statement, and it was hidden from them, so they did not understand it: and they were afraid to ask him about it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">Then there arose a dispute among them about which of them was the greatest.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">And Jesus, perceiving what they were thinking in their hearts, took a child, and put him beside him,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">And said to them, Whoever shall receive this child in my name receives me: and whoever shall receive me receives him who sent me: for he who is least among you, that one shall be great.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">And John answered, Master, we saw someone casting out devils in your name; and we forbade him, because he does not follow along with us.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="15">The Lord then answered him, and said, You hypocrite, does not each one of you on the sabbath untie his ox or his donkey from the stall, and lead him away to water?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And ought not this woman, being a daughter of Abraham, whom Satan has bound, lo, these eighteen years, be loosed from this bond on the sabbath day?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And when he had said these things, all his adversaries were ashamed: and all the people rejoiced over all the glorious things he was doing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Then he said, What is the kingdom of God like? and to what shall I compare it?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">It is like a mustard seed, which a man took, and planted in his garden; and it grew, and became a great tree; and the birds of the air lodged in its branches.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And again he said, To what shall I compare the kingdom of God?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">It is like leaven, which a woman took and hid in three measures of flour, until it was all leavened.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And he went through the cities and villages, teaching, and traveling toward Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Then someone said to him, Lord, will only a few be saved? And he said to them,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Strive to enter in at the narrow gate: for many, I say to you, will seek to enter in, and shall not be able.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">When once the master of the house has risen up, and has shut the door, and you begin to stand without, and to knock at the door, saying, Lord, Lord, open up to us; then he shall answer and say to you, I do not know where you are from:</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="27">But he shall say, I tell you, I do not know where you are from; depart from me, all you workers of iniquity.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">There shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth, when you see Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, and all the prophets, in the kingdom of God, and yourselves thrust out.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="30">And, behold, there are some who are last who shall be first, and there are some who are first who shall be last.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">That same hour some of the Pharisees came, saying to him, Get away, and depart from here: for Herod wants to kill you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">And he said to them, Go tell that fox, Behold, I cast out devils and perform cures today and tomorrow, and the third day I shall complete my course.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">Nevertheless, I must journey on today, and tomorrow, and the day following: for it cannot be that a prophet should perish outside of Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, which kills the prophets, and stones those who are sent to you; how often would I have gathered your children together, as a hen gathers her brood under her wings, and you would not allow it!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">Behold, your house is left to you desolate: and truly I say to you, You shall not see me, until the time comes when you shall say, Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="14">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And it came to pass, as he went into the house of one of the chief Pharisees to eat on the sabbath day, that they watched him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And, behold, there was a certain man in front of him who had dropsy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And Jesus spoke to the lawyers and Pharisees, asking, Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath day?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">But they held their peace. And he took hold of him, and healed him, and let him go;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And answered them, saying, If one of you has a son or an ox fall into a pit on the sabbath day, which of you will not immediately pull him out?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And they could not answer these things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And he told a parable to those who were invited, when he noticed how they chose the places of honour; saying to them,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">When you are invited by someone to a wedding, do not sit down at the place of honour; for one more distinguished than you may have been invited;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And he who invited both of you will come and say to you, Give this man your place; and with shame you will begin to take the lowest place.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">But when you are invited, go and sit in the lowest place; that when he who invited you comes, he may say to you, Friend, go up higher: then you shall have honour in the presence of those who are at the table with you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">For whoever exalts himself shall be abased; and he who humbles himself shall be exalted.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Then he said to his host, When you give a luncheon or dinner, do not invite your friends, your brothers, your kinsmen, or your rich neighbours; lest they invite you in return, and you are repaid.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">But when you have a feast, call the poor, the maimed, the lame, the blind:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And you shall be blessed; for they cannot repay you: but you shall be repaid at the resurrection of the just.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And when one of those who reclined at table with him heard these things, he said to him, Blessed is he who shall eat bread in the kingdom of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Then he said to him, A certain man made a great banquet, and invited many:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And at the banquet time he sent his servant to say to those who were invited, Come; for everything is now ready.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And they all alike began to make excuses. The first said to him, I have bought a piece of land, and I must go and see it: Please excuse me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And another said, I have bought five yoke of oxen, and I am going to try them out: Please excuse me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And another said, I have married a wife, and therefore I cannot come.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">So the servant returned, and told his lord these things. Then the master of the house became angry and said to his servant, Go out quickly into the streets and lanes of the city, and bring in here the poor, and the crippled, and the blind, and the lame.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And the servant said, Lord, it has been done as you have commanded, and yet there is still room.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And the lord said to the servant, Go out into the highways and along the hedgerows, and compel them to come in, that my house may be filled.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">For I say to you, That none of those men who were invited shall taste my banquet.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And great multitudes went with him: and he turned, and said to them,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">If anyone comes to me, and does not hate his father, and mother, and wife, and children, and brothers, and sisters, yea, and even his own life, he cannot be my disciple.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And whoever does not carry his own cross, and come after me, cannot be my disciple.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">For which of you, intending to build a tower, does not sit down first and count the cost, whether he has sufficient money to finish it?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Lest perhaps, after he has laid the foundation, and is not able to finish it, all who behold it will begin to mock him,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">And he spoke this parable to them, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">What man of you, having a hundred sheep, if he lose one of them, does not leave the ninety-nine in the wilderness, and go after the one that is lost, until he finds it?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And when he has found it, he lays it on his shoulders, rejoicing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And when he comes home, he calls together his friends and neighbours, saying to them, Rejoice with me; for I have found my sheep which was lost.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">I say to you, that likewise there shall be more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents, than over ninety-nine righteous persons, who do not need to repent.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Or what woman, having ten pieces of silver, if she lose one piece, does not light a lamp, and sweep the house, and seek diligently until she finds it?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And when she has found it, she calls her friends and her neighbours together, saying, Rejoice with me; for I have found the coin which I had lost.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Likewise, I say to you, there is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner who repents.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And he said, A certain man had two sons:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And the younger of them said to his father, Father, give me my part of the estate. So he divided his property between them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And not many days after the younger son gathered everything together, and took a journey into a far country, and there wasted his estate with riotous living.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And when he had spent everything, there arose a mighty famine in that land; and he began to be in want.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And he went and hired himself to a citizen of that country; and he sent him into his fields to feed swine.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And he would gladly have filled his stomach with the pods the swine were eating: but no man gave him anything.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And when he came to himself, he said, How many of my father's hired servants have bread enough to spare, and I perish with hunger!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">I will arise and go to my father, and will say to him, Father, I have sinned against heaven, and in your sight,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And am no longer worthy to be called your son: treat me as one of your hired servants.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And he arose, and went to his father. But when he was yet a great way off, his father saw him, and had compassion, and ran, and threw his arms around his neck, and kissed him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And the son said to him, Father, I have sinned against heaven, and in your sight, and am no longer worthy to be called your son.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">But the father said to his servants, Bring forth the best robe, and put it on him; and put a ring on his hand, and sandals on his feet:</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="24">For this son of mine was dead, and is alive again; he was lost, and is found. And they began to be merry.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Now his elder son was in the field: and as he came and drew near to the house, he heard music and dancing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And he called one of the servants, and asked what these things meant.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And he said to him, Your brother has come; and your father has killed the fatted calf, because he has received him back safe and sound.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And he was angry, and would not go in: therefore his father came out, and pleaded with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And he answered his father, Lo, these many years I have served you and never disobeyed your commandment: and yet you never gave me a kid, that I might make merry with my friends:</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="31">And he said to him, Son, you are always with me, and all that I have is yours.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">But we had to make merry, and be glad: for this brother of yours was dead, and is alive again; and was lost, and is found.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="16">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And he also said to his disciples, There was a certain rich man, who had a steward, and charges were brought to him that the steward was wasting his goods.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And he called him, and said to him, What is this that I hear of you? give an account of your stewardship; for you may no longer be steward.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Then the steward said to himself, What shall I do? for my lord is taking away my stewardship: I am not strong enough to dig; and I am ashamed to beg.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">I know what to do, so that when I am put out of the stewardship, people will receive me into their houses.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">So he called in every one of his lord's debtors, and said to the first, How much do you owe to my lord?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And he said, A hundred measures of oil. And he said to him, Take your bill, and sit down quickly, and write fifty.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Then he said to another, And how much do you owe? And he said, A hundred measures of wheat. And he said to him, Take your bill, and write eighty.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And the lord commended the dishonest steward, because he had acted shrewdly: for the children of this world are more shrewd in dealing with own kind than are the children of light.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And I say to you, Make friends for yourselves using worldly wealth; that, when it fails, they may receive you into the eternal habitations.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">He who is faithful in that which is least is faithful also in much: and he who is dishonest in the least is also dishonest in much.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Therefore, if you have not been faithful with worldly wealth, who will entrust you with true riches?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And if you have not been faithful with that which is another man's, who shall give you possessions of your own?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">No servant can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. You cannot serve God and money.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">The Pharisees, who were covetous, heard all these things: and they derided him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And he said to them, You justify yourselves before men; but God knows your hearts: for that which is highly esteemed among men is an abomination in the sight of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">The law and the prophets were until John: since that time the kingdom of God is preached, and every man forces his way into it.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="18">Whoever divorces his wife, and marries another, commits adultery: and whoever marries a divorced woman commits adultery.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">There was a certain rich man, who was clothed in purple and fine linen, and feasted sumptuously every day:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And there was a certain beggar named Lazarus, who was laid at his gate, covered with sores,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And he longed to eat the crumbs which fell from the rich man's table. Even the dogs came and licked his sores.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And it came to pass, that the beggar died, and was carried by the angels into Abraham's bosom: the rich man also died, and was buried;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And in Hades he lift up his eyes, being in torment, and saw Abraham far off, and Lazarus in his bosom.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And he cried out, Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, and cool my tongue; for I am tormented in this flame.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">But Abraham said, Son, remember that in your lifetime you received your good things, and Lazarus received evil things: but now he is comforted, and you are tormented.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And beside all this, between us and you a great gulf has been fixed: so that those who would pass from here to you cannot; nor can any pass over from there to us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">He said, Then I beg you, father, that you would send him to my father's house:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">For I have five brothers. Have him warn them, lest they also come into this place of torment.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Abraham said to him, They have Moses and the prophets; let them hear them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And he said, No, father Abraham: but if someone went to them from the dead, they will repent.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Then he said to the disciples, It is certain that stumbling blocks will come: but woe to him through whom they come!</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">Be on your guard: If your brother sins, rebuke him; and if he repents, forgive him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And if he sins against you seven times in a day, and seven times a day comes to you, saying, I repent; you must forgive him.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="10">So likewise you, when you have done all those things which are commanded of you, say, We are unworthy servants: we have merely done our duty.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And it came to pass, as he went to Jerusalem, that he passed between Samaria and Galilee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And as he entered into a certain village, ten leprous men met him. They stood at a distance,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And they lifted up their voices, and said, Jesus, Master, have mercy on us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And when he saw them, he said to them, Go show yourselves to the priests. And it came to pass, that, as they went, they were cleansed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And one of them, when he saw that he was healed, turned back, and with a loud voice glorified God,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="19">And he said to him, Arise, go your way: your faith has made you well.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And when he was asked by the Pharisees, when the kingdom of God should come, he answered them and said, The kingdom of God does not come with signs:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Nor shall they say, Look, here it is! or, look there! for, behold, the kingdom of God is within you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And he said to the disciples, The days will come, when you shall desire to see one of the days of the Son of man, and you shall not see it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And they shall say to you, See here!; or, see there!: do not go not after them, or follow them.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="8">I tell you that he will vindicate them speedily. Nevertheless, when the Son of man comes, shall he find faith on the earth?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And he spoke this parable to certain people who trusted in themselves that they were righteous, and despised others:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Two men went up into the temple to pray; the one a Pharisee, and the other a tax gatherer.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">The Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself, God, I thank you that I am not as other men are, extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even as this tax gatherer.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">I fast twice in the week, I give tithes of all that I possess.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And the tax gatherer, standing far off, would not lift up so much as his eyes to heaven, but beat upon his breast, saying, God be merciful to me, a sinner.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">I tell you, this man went down to his house justified rather than the other: for every one who exalts himself shall be abased; and he who humbles himself shall be exalted.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="27">And he said, Things that are impossible with men are possible with God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Then Peter said, Lo, we have left all, and followed you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And he said to them, Truly I say to you, There is no man who has left house, or parents, or brothers, or wife, or children, for the sake of the kingdom of God,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Who shall not receive many times more in this present time, and in the world to come, life everlasting.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Then he took the twelve aside, and said to them, Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem, and all things that are written by the prophets concerning the Son of man shall be accomplished.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">For he shall be delivered to the Gentiles, and shall be mocked, and spitefully treated, and spit upon:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">And they shall flog him, and put him to death: and on the third day he shall rise again.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">And they understood none of these things: this saying was hidden from them, and they did not comprehend the things which were spoken.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">And it came to pass, that when he came near to Jericho, a certain blind man sat by the road begging:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">And hearing the multitude pass by, he asked what it meant.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">And they told him, Jesus of Nazareth is passing by.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">And he cried out, Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">And those who led the way rebuked him, telling him to hold his peace: but he cried out all the more, Son of David, have mercy on me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">And Jesus stood still, and commanded him to be brought to him: and when he had come near, he asked him,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">What do you want me to do for you? And he said, Lord, I want to receive my sight.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">And Jesus said to him, Receive your sight: your faith has healed you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">And immediately he received his sight, and followed him, glorifying God: and all the people, when they saw it, gave praise to God.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="19">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And Jesus entered and was passing through Jericho.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And, behold, there was a man named Zacchaeus, who was the chief among the tax gatherers, and he was rich.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And he sought to see who Jesus was; but could not because of the crowd, for he was of small stature.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And he ran ahead, and climbed up into a sycomore tree to see him: for he was to pass that way.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And when Jesus came to the place, he looked up, and saw him, and said to him, Zacchaeus, make haste, and come down; for today I must stay at your house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And he made haste, and came down, and received him joyfully.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And when they saw it, they all murmured, saying, He has gone to be the guest of a man who is a sinner.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And Zacchaeus stood, and said to the Lord; Behold, Lord, the half of my goods I give to the poor; and if I have defrauded any man of anything, I will repay it fourfold.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And Jesus said to him, This day salvation has come to this house, because he also is a son of Abraham.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">For the Son of man has come to seek and to save that which was lost.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And while they listened to these things, he told a parable, because he was near to Jerusalem, and because they thought that the kingdom of God would immediately appear.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Therefore he said, A certain nobleman went into a far country to receive for himself a kingdom, and then to return.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And he called his ten servants, and gave them ten minas, and said to them, Trade with these until I come.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">But his citizens hated him, and sent a message after him, saying, We do not want this man to reign over us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And it came to pass, that when he returned, having received the kingdom, that he commanded the servants to whom he had given the money to be called to him, that he might know how much every man had gained by trading.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">The first came, saying, Lord, your mina has gained ten minas.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And he said to him, Well done, you good servant: because you have been faithful in a very little, take authority over ten cities.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And the second came, saying, Lord, your mina has gained five minas.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And he said likewise to him, You shall be in authority over five cities.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And another came, saying, Lord, behold, here is your mina, which I have kept laid up in a handkerchief:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">For I feared you, because you are a severe man: you take up what you have not laid down, and reap what you did not sow.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And he said to him, Out of your own mouth will I judge you, you wicked servant. You knew that I was a severe man, taking up what I did not lay down, and reaping what I did not sow:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Why then did you not put my money into the bank, that at my coming I might have collected it with interest?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And he said to those who stood by, Take from him the mina, and give it to him who has ten minas.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And they said to him, Lord, he already has ten minas.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">I say to you, To everyone who has shall more be given; and from him who has not, even what he has shall be taken away from him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">As for my enemies, those who did not want me to reign over them, bring them here, and kill them in front of me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And when he had spoken these things, he went on ahead, ascending to Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And it came to pass, when he had come near to Bethphage and Bethany, at the mount called Olivet, he sent two of his disciples,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Saying, Go into the village opposite you; and as you enter it you shall find a colt tied, on which no one has ever sat: untie it, and bring it here.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">And if anyone asks you, Why are you untying it? you shall say, Because the Lord has need of it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">And those who were sent went their way, and found it as he had said.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">And as they were untying the colt, its owners said to them, Why are you untying the colt?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">And they said, The Lord has need of it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">And they brought it to Jesus: and they cast their garments upon the colt, and they put Jesus on it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">And as he went, they spread their clothes on the road.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">And as he was coming near, at the descent of the mount of Olives, the whole multitude of the disciples began to rejoice and praise God with a loud voice for all the mighty works that they had seen;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">Saying, Blessed is the King who comes in the name of the Lord: peace in heaven, and glory in the highest.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">And some of the Pharisees in the multitude said to him, Teacher, rebuke your disciples.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">And he answered and said to them, I tell you that if they should hold their peace, the very stones would cry out.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">And when he had come near, he beheld the city, and wept over it,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">Saying, If you, even you, had only known on this day, the things which make for peace! but now they are hidden from your eyes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">For the days shall come upon you, when your enemies shall build an embankment about you, and surround you, and keep you in on every side,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">And shall level you to the ground, and your children within you; and they shall not leave in you one stone upon another; because you did not know the time of your visitation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">And he went into the temple, and began to cast out those who were selling;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">Saying to them, It is written, My house shall be a house of prayer: but you have made it a den of thieves.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">And he taught daily in the temple. But the chief priests and the scribes and the leaders of the people sought to destroy him,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">But could not find what they might do: for all the people hung upon his words.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="20">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And it came to pass, on one of those days, as he taught the people in the temple, and preached the gospel, the chief priests and the scribes came up to him with the elders,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And said to him, Tell us by what authority you do these things? or who it is who gave you this authority?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And he answered and said to them, I will also ask you one thing; and you answer me:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">The baptism of John, was it from heaven, or from men?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And they discussed among themselves, saying, If we shall say, From heaven; he will say, Why then did you not believe him?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But if we say, From men, all the people will stone us, for they are persuaded that John was a prophet.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And they answered that they did not know from where it came.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And Jesus said to them, Neither will tell I you by what authority I do these things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Then he began to tell the people this parable; A certain man planted a vineyard, and rented it out to tenants, and went into a far country for a long time.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And at harvest time he sent a servant to the tenants, that they should give him some of the fruit of the vineyard: but the tenants beat him, and sent him away empty-handed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">He sent another servant: and they beat him also, and treated him shamefully, and sent him away empty-handed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And he sent a third: and they wounded him, and cast him out.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Then the lord of the vineyard said, What shall I do? I will send my beloved son: it may be they will respect him when they see him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">But when the tenants saw him, they reasoned among themselves, saying, This is the heir: come, let us kill him, that the inheritance may be ours.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">So they cast him out of the vineyard, and killed him. What then shall the lord of the vineyard do to them?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">He shall come and destroy these tenants, and shall give the vineyard to others. When they heard this, they said, God forbid.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And he looked at them, and said, What then is this that is written, The stone which the builders rejected has become the cornerstone?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Whoever shall fall upon that stone shall be broken; but on whomever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And the chief priests and the scribes sought to lay hands on him that same hour, for they perceived that he had spoken this parable against them; but they feared the people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">So they watched him, and sent forth spies, who pretended to be sincere, that they might catch him in his words, that they might deliver him to the power and authority of the governor.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And they asked him, Teacher, we know that you speak and teach correctly, and that you are not partial to any person, but teach the way of God truly:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Is it lawful for us to pay taxes to Caesar, or not?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">But he perceived their craftiness, and said to them,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Show me a denarius. Whose image and inscription are on it? They answered, Caesar's.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And he said to them, Then render to Caesar the things which are Caesar's, and to God the things which are God's.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And they could not trap him in what he said before the people: they marvelled at his answer, and held their peace.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Then some of the Sadducees, who deny that there is any resurrection, came to him, and they asked him,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Teacher, Moses wrote to us, If any man's brother dies, leaving a wife and no children, that man should take the widow, and raise up children for his brother.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Now there were seven brothers: the first took a wife, and died without children.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And the second,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">And the third took her; as did all seven: and they left no children, and died.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">Last of all the woman died.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">Therefore, in the resurrection, whose wife will she be? for all seven had her as wife.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Jesus answered and said to them, The people of this age marry, and are given in marriage:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">But those who shall be accounted worthy to obtain that age, and the resurrection from the dead, neither marry, nor are given in marriage:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">Nor can they die any more: for they are like the angels; and are the children of God, since they are children of the resurrection.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">That the dead are raised, even Moses showed in the account of the bush, when he called the Lord the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">For he is not the God of the dead, but of the living: for all are alive to him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">Then certain of the scribes answered, Teacher, you have spoken well.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">And after that they dared not ask him any more questions.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">And he said to them, How is it that they say the Christ is David's son?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">David himself says in the book of Psalms, The LORD said to my Lord, Sit at my right hand,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">Until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">Therefore David calls him Lord; so how is he then his son?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">Then in the hearing of all the people he said to his disciples,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">Beware of the scribes, who like to walk about in long robes, and love greetings in the marketplaces, and the best seats in the synagogues, and the places of honour at feasts;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">They devour widows' houses, and for a show make long prayers: they shall receive the greater condemnation.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="21">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And he looked up, and saw the rich people putting their gifts into the treasury.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And he also saw a certain poor widow putting in two small copper coins.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And he said, Truly I say to you, that this poor widow has put in more than all of them:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">For all these have given offerings to God out of their abundance: but she in her poverty has put in all she had to live on.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And as some spoke of the temple, how it was adorned with beautiful stones and gifts, he said,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">As for these things which you behold, the days will come, in which there shall not be one stone left upon another; every one of them shall be thrown down.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And they asked him, saying, Teacher, when shall these things happen? and what sign will there be that these things are about to take place?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And he said, Take heed that you are not deceived: for many shall come in my name, saying, I am the Christ; and, the time draws near: do not go after them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And when you hear of wars and disturbances, do not be terrified: for these things must first come to pass; but the end does not follow immediately.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Then said he to them, Nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And there shall be great earthquakes in various places, and famines, and pestilences; and fearful sights and great signs from heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">But before all this, they shall lay their hands on you, and persecute you, delivering you up to the synagogues, and into prisons, and you shall be brought before kings and rulers for my name's sake.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And it shall be a time for you to bear testimony.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Therefore, settle it in your hearts, not to meditate beforehand how you shall answer:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">For I will give you a mouth and wisdom, which all your adversaries shall not be able to resist or refute.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And you shall be betrayed both by parents, and brothers, and relatives, and friends; and some of you shall they cause to be put to death.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And you shall be hated by all for my name's sake.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">But not a hair of your head shall perish.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">By your perseverance you shall win your souls.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And when you shall see Jerusalem surrounded by armies, then know that its desolation is near.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Then let those who are in Judaea flee to the mountains; and let those who are inside the city depart; and let not those who are in the country enter into it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">For these are days of vengeance, that all things which are written may be fulfilled.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">But woe to those who are with child, and to those who nurse infants, in those days! for there shall be great distress in the land, and wrath upon this people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And they shall fall by the edge of the sword, and shall be led away captive into all nations: and Jerusalem shall be trodden down by the Gentiles, until the times of the Gentiles are fulfilled.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And there shall be signs in the sun, and in the moon, and in the stars; and upon the earth nations shall be distressed and perplexed by the roaring waves of the sea;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Men's hearts failing them for fear and foreboding of those things which are coming upon the earth: for the powers of the heavens shall be shaken.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And then they shall see the Son of man coming in a cloud with power and great glory.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And when these things begin to come to pass, then look up, and lift up your heads; for your redemption draws near.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And he told them a parable; Behold the fig tree, and all the trees;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">When they shoot forth leaves, you see and know for yourselves that summer is at hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">So likewise, when you see these things come to pass, know that the kingdom of God is at hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">Truly I say to you, This generation shall not pass away, until all is fulfilled.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">Heaven and earth shall pass away: but my words shall not pass away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">And take heed to yourselves, lest at any time your hearts be weighed down with dissipation, and drunkenness, and the cares of this life, so that day comes upon you unexpectedly like a snare.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">For as a snare shall it come upon all those who live on the face of the whole earth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">Watch therefore, and pray always, that you may be strong and accounted worthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass, and to stand before the Son of man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">Now in the daytime he was teaching in the temple; and at night he went out, and stayed on the mount that is called Olivet.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Now the feast of unleavened bread, which is called the Passover, drew near.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And the chief priests and scribes sought how they might kill him; for they feared the people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Then Satan entered into Judas, called Iscariot, one the twelve.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="5">They were glad, and agreed to give him money.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">So he consented, and sought an opportunity to betray him to them in the absence of the multitude.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Then came the day of unleavened bread, when the passover lamb must be killed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And he sent Peter and John, saying, Go and prepare the passover for us, that we may eat it.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="46">And said to them, Why do you sleep? rise and pray, that you may not enter into temptation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">And while he yet spoke, behold a multitude came, and he who was called Judas, one of the twelve, went before them, and drew near to Jesus to kiss him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">But Jesus said to him, Judas, do you betray the Son of man with a kiss?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">When those who were around him saw what was about to happen, they said to him, Lord, shall we strike with the sword?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">And one of them struck the servant of the high priest, and cut off his right ear.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="51">And Jesus answered, No more of this. And he touched his ear, and healed him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="52">Then Jesus said to the chief priests, and officers of the temple, and the elders, who had come to him, Have you come out, as against a robber, with swords and clubs?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="53">When I was with you daily in the temple, you did not stretch forth hands against me: but this is your hour, when darkness reigns.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="54">Then they seized him, and led him away, and brought him into the high priest's house. And Peter followed from afar.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="55">And when they had kindled a fire in the middle of the courtyard, and sat down together, Peter sat among them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="56">But a certain maid beheld him as he sat by the fire, and earnestly looked upon him, and said, This man was also with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="57">And he denied it, saying, Woman, I do not know him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="58">And after a little while another saw him, and said, You are also one of them. And Peter said, Man, I am not.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="59">And after about an hour another insisted, Truly this man was also with him: for he is a Galilaean.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="60">And Peter said, Man, I do not know what you are saying. And immediately, while he yet spoke, the cock crowed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="61">And the Lord turned, and looked at Peter. And Peter remembered the word of the Lord, how he had said to him, Before the cock crows today, you shall deny me thrice.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="62">And he went out, and wept bitterly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="63">And the men who held Jesus mocked him, and struck him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="64">And they blindfolded him, and struck him on the face, and asked him, Prophesy, who was it who struck you?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="65">And they spoke many other insulting things against him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="66">And as soon as it was day, the elders of the people and the chief priests and the scribes came together, and led him into their council, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="67">Are you the Christ? tell us. And he said to them, If I tell you, you will not believe:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="68">And if I question you, you will not answer me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="69">Hereafter shall the Son of man sit on the right hand of the power of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="70">Then they all said, Are you then the Son of God? And he said to them, You say that I am.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="71">And they said, What need have we of further testimony? for we ourselves have heard from his own mouth.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="23">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And the whole multitude of them arose, and led him to Pilate.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And they began to accuse him, saying, We found this fellow perverting our nation, and forbidding us to give taxes to Caesar, saying that he himself is Christ a King.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And Pilate asked him, Are you the King of the Jews? And he answered him, You have said so.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Then Pilate said to the chief priests and to the people, I find no fault in this man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And they were the more fierce, saying, He stirs up the people, teaching throughout all Judaea, beginning in Galilee and coming all the way to this place.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">When Pilate heard this, he asked whether the man was a Galilaean.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And as soon as he learned that he belonged to Herod's jurisdiction, he sent him to Herod, who was himself also in Jerusalem at that time.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And when Herod saw Jesus, he was exceedingly glad: for he had long wanted to see him, because he had heard many things about him; and he hoped to see a miracle done by him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Then he questioned him at length; but he made no answer.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">The chief priests and scribes stood and vehemently accused him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And Herod with his men of war treated him with contempt, and mocked him, and arrayed him in a gorgeous robe, and sent him again to Pilate.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And that same day Pilate and Herod became friends: for before there had been enmity between them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And Pilate, when he had called together the chief priests and the rulers and the people,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Said to them, You have brought this man to me, as one who perverts the people: but, behold, having examined him before you, I found no fault in this man regarding those things of which you accuse him:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">No, nor did Herod: for I sent you to him; and, lo, nothing worthy of death has been done by him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Therefore I will chastise him, and release him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">[For he was obliged to release one man to them at the feast.]</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">But they all cried out at once, saying, Away with this man, and release to us Barabbas:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">(Who for a certain sedition made in the city, and for murder, was cast into prison.)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Pilate, wanting to release Jesus, spoke to them again.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">But they cried out, saying, Crucify him, crucify him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And he said to them a third time, Why, what evil has he done? I have found in him no crime deserving death: therefore I will chastise him, and let him go.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And they were insistent, with loud voices demanding that he be crucified. And their voices prevailed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">So Pilate pronounced the sentence they demanded.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And he released to them the one they asked for, he who had been cast into prison for sedition and murder; but he delivered Jesus over to their will.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And as they led him away, they laid hold upon one Simon, a Cyrenian, coming in from the country, and on him they laid the cross, that he might carry it after Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And there followed him a great company of people, and of women who bewailed and lamented him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">But Jesus, turning to them, said, Daughters of Jerusalem, do not weep for me, but weep for yourselves, and for your children.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">For, behold, the days are coming when they shall say, Blessed are the barren, and the wombs that never bore, and the breasts which never nursed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Then shall they begin to say to the mountains, Fall upon us; and to the hills, Cover us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">For if they do these things when the wood is green, what shall happen when it is dry?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">And there were also two others, criminals, who were led away with him to be put to death.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">And when they had come to the place, which is called The Skull, there they crucified him, and the criminals, one on the right hand, and the other on the left.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Then Jesus said, Father, forgive them; for they do not know what they do. And they divided his clothing by casting lots.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">The people stood watching. And the rulers derided him, saying, He saved others; let him save himself, if he is the Christ, the chosen of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">And the soldiers also mocked him, coming to him, and offering him wine vinegar,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">And saying, If you are the king of the Jews, save yourself.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">Now there was also an inscription written over him, THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">And one of the criminals who was hung there railed at him, saying, If you are the Christ, save yourself and us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">But the other rebuked him, saying, Do you not fear God, since you are under the same condemnation?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">And we indeed justly; for we receive the due reward of our deeds: but this man has done nothing wrong.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">And he said to Jesus, Lord, remember me when you come into your kingdom.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">And Jesus said to him, Truly I say to you, Today you shall be with me in paradise.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">And it was about the sixth hour, and there was a darkness over all the earth until the ninth hour,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">For the sun was darkened. And the veil of the temple was torn in two.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">And Jesus cried out with a loud voice, and said, Father, into your hands I commit my spirit: and having said this, he breathed his last.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">Now when the centurion saw what had taken place, he glorified God, saying, Certainly this was a righteous man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">And all the people who came together to see the sight, when they saw the things that had taken place, struck their breasts, and returned.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">And all his acquaintances, and the women who followed him from Galilee, stood afar off, beholding these things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">Now, behold, there was a man named Joseph, a member of the council; a good man, and just:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="51">(Who had not consented to their decision and deed;) a man from Arimathaea, a city of the Jews: who was himself waiting for the kingdom of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="52">This man went to Pilate, and asked for the body of Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="53">And he took it down, and wrapped it in linen, and laid it in a tomb cut into the stone, where no man had ever before been laid.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="54">It was the day of preparation, and the sabbath drew near.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="55">Now the women who came with him from Galilee, followed behind, and beheld the tomb, and how his body was laid.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="56">Then they returned, and prepared spices and ointments; and rested on the sabbath day according to the commandment.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="24">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now upon the first day of the week, very early in the morning, they came to the tomb, bringing the spices which they had prepared.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And they found the stone rolled away from the tomb.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">They entered, but did not find the body of the Lord Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And it came to pass, as they were much perplexed about this, behold, two men stood by them in shining garments:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">They were afraid, and bowed their faces to the earth, and the men said to them, Why do you seek the living among the dead?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">He is not here, but has risen: remember how he spoke to you when he was still in Galilee,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Saying, The Son of man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and the third day rise again.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And they remembered his words,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And returned from the tomb, and told all these things to the eleven, and to all the rest.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">They were Mary of Magdala, and Joanna, and Mary the mother of James, and other women with them, who told these things to the apostles.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And their words seemed to them as idle tales, and they did not believe them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Then Peter arose, and ran to the tomb; and stooping down, he saw the linen clothes laid by themselves, and departed, wondering to himself at that which had come to pass.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And, behold, two of them went that same day to a village called Emmaus, which was about seven miles from Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And they talked together of all these things which had happened.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And it came to pass, that, while they were conversing and discussing, Jesus himself drew near, and went along with them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">But their eyes were kept from recognizing him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And he said to them, What is it that you are discussing with each other as you walk? And they stood still, looking downcast.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And one of them, whose name was Cleopas, answered him, Are you the only visitor in Jerusalem who does not know the things which have come to pass there in these days?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And he said to them, What things? And they said to him, Concerning Jesus of Nazareth, who was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him up to be condemned to death, and have crucified him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">But we trusted that it was he who would redeem Israel: and beside all this, today is the third day since these things happened.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Yea, and certain women of our company astonished us, for they were at the tomb early;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And they did not find his body. They came back, saying that they had seen a vision of angels, who said that he was alive.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And certain of those who were with us went to the tomb, and found it just as the women had said: but him they did not see.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Then he said to them, O fools, and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Was it not necessary for the Christ to have suffered these things, and to enter into his glory?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And beginning with Moses and all the prophets, he explained to them all the things concerning himself in the scriptures.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And they drew near to the village, where they were going: and he acted as though he would have gone farther.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">But they urged him strongly, saying, Stay with us: for it is getting toward evening, and the day is nearly over. And he went in to stay with them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And it came to pass, as he was at table with them, he took bread, and blessed it, and broke it, and gave it to them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">And their eyes were opened, and they recognized him; and he vanished out of their sight.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">And they said to one another, Did not our hearts burn within us, while he talked with us along the way, and while he opened to us the scriptures?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">They rose up that same hour, and returned to Jerusalem, and found the eleven gathered together, along with those who were with them,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Saying, The Lord has risen indeed, and has appeared to Simon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">And they told what had happened on the road, and how he was recognized by them in the breaking of bread.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">And as they spoke of this, Jesus himself stood in the midst of them, and said to them, Peace be with you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">But they were terrified and frightened, and supposed that they were seeing a spirit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">And he said to them, Why are you troubled? and why do doubts arise in your hearts?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">Behold my hands and my feet, that it is I myself: touch me, and see; for a spirit does not have flesh and bones, as you see that I have.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">And when he had thus spoken, he showed them his hands and his feet.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">And while they still did not believe because of joy, and marvelled, he said to them, Have you anything here to eat?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">And they gave him a piece of a broiled fish.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">And he took it, and ate it before them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">He said to them, These are the words which I spoke to you, while I was yet with you, that all things must be fulfilled which are written about me in the law of Moses, and in the prophets, and in the psalms.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">Then he opened their minds, that they might understand the scriptures,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">And said to them, Thus it is written, that the Christ should suffer, and rise from the dead on the third day:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">And that repentance for forgiveness of sins should be preached in his name among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">You are witnesses of these things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">And behold, I send the promise of my Father upon you: but stay in the city, until you are clothed with power from on high.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">And he led them out as far as Bethany, and he lifted up his hands, and blessed them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="51">And it came to pass, while he blessed them, he was parted from them, and carried up into heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="52">And they worshipped him, and returned to Jerusalem with great joy:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="53">And were continually in the temple, praising God.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">He was in the beginning with God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">All things were made by him; and without him was nothing made that was made.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">In him was life; and the life was the light of men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And the light shines in the darkness; and the darkness has not comprehended it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">There was a man sent from God, whose name was John.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">He came as a witness, to bear witness of the Light, that all men through him might believe.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">He was not the Light, but was sent to bear witness to the Light.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">The true Light, which enlightens every man, was coming into the world.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">He was in the world, and the world was made by him, but the world did not know him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">He came to his own, and his own did not receive him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">But as many as received him, to them he gave the right to become the children of God, even to those who believe in his name:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Who were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory, glory as of the only begotten from the Father,) full of grace and truth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">John bore witness to him, and cried out, saying, This was he of whom I spoke, He who comes after me ranks above me: for he was before me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And of his fulness we have all received, and grace upon grace.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">For the law was given by Moses, but grace and truth came through Jesus Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">No man has seen God at any time; but God the only Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, he has made him known.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And this is the witness of John, when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, Who are you?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And he confessed, and did not deny; but confessed, I am not the Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And they asked him, What then? Are you Elijah? And he said, I am not. Are you the prophet? And he answered, No.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Then they said to him, Who are you? that we may give an answer to those who sent us. What do you say about yourself?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">He said, I am the voice of one crying out in the wilderness, Make straight the way of the Lord, as the prophet Isaiah said.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Now they had been sent by the Pharisees.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And they asked him, Why do you baptize then, if you are not the Christ, or Elijah, or the prophet?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">John answered them, saying, I baptize with water: but one stands among you, whom you do not know;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">It is he who comes after me, the thong of whose sandal I am not worthy to untie.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">These things took place in Bethany, beyond the Jordan, where John was baptizing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">The next day John saw Jesus coming to him, and said, Behold the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">This is he of whom I said, After me comes a man who ranks above me: for he was before me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">And I did not know him: but I came baptizing with water that he might be revealed to Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">And John bore witness, saying, I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove, and it remained upon him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">And I did not know him: but he who sent me to baptize with water said to me, He upon whom you see the Spirit descend and remain, this is he who baptizes with the Holy Spirit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">And I have seen, and have borne witness that this is the Son of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">Again the next day John stood with two of his disciples;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">And looking upon Jesus as he walked, he said, Behold the Lamb of God!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">And the two disciples heard him speak, and they followed Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">Then Jesus turned, and saw them following, and said to them, What do you seek? They said to him, Rabbi, (which translated means Teacher,) where are you staying?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">He said to them, Come and see. They came and saw where he was staying, and remained with him that day: for it was about the tenth hour.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">One of the two who heard John speak, and followed him, was Andrew, Simon Peter's brother.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">He first found his brother Simon, and said to him, We have found the Messiah, which translated means Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">And he brought him to Jesus. And when Jesus saw him, he said, You are Simon the son of John: you shall be called Cephas, which translated means, Peter.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">The day following Jesus decided to go forth into Galilee; and he found Philip, and said to him, Follow me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">Now Philip was of Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">Philip found Nathanael, and said to him, We have found him, of whom Moses in the law, and the prophets, wrote about, Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">And Nathanael said to him, Can any good thing come out of Nazareth? Philip said to him, Come and see.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him, and said of him, Behold an Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">Nathanael said to him, How do you know me? Jesus answered and said to him, Before Philip called you, when you were under the fig tree, I saw you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">Nathanael answered and said to him, Rabbi, you are the Son of God; you are the King of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">Jesus answered him, Because I said to you, I saw you under the fig tree, do you believe? you shall see greater things than these.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="51">And he said to him, Truly, truly, I say to you, You shall see heaven opened, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="2">
      <VERS vnumber="1">On the third day there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee; and the mother of Jesus was there:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And both Jesus and his disciples were invited to the marriage.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And when the wine gave out, the mother of Jesus said to him, They have no wine.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Jesus said to her, Woman, what have I to do with you? my hour has not yet come.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">His mother said to the servants, Whatever he says to you, do it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Now there were six waterpots of stone set there, for the Jewish custom of purification, containing twenty or thirty gallons apiece.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Jesus said to them, Fill the waterpots with water. And they filled them up to the brim.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And he said to them, Now draw some out, and take it to the steward of the feast. So they took it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">When the steward of the feast tasted the water that had become wine, and did not know where it came from: (but the servants who drew the water knew;) the steward of the feast called the bridegroom,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And said to him, Every man serves the good wine at the beginning; and when men have drunk freely, then that which is worse: but you have kept the good wine until now.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">This, the beginning of his miraculous signs, Jesus performed in Cana of Galilee, and manifested his glory; and his disciples believed in him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">After this he went down to Capernaum, he, and his mother, and his brothers, and his disciples: and they stayed there not many days.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And the passover of the Jews was at hand, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And found in the temple those who sold oxen and sheep and doves, and the changers of money sitting there:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And when he had made a whip of small cords, he drove them all out of the temple, with the sheep, and the oxen; and he poured out the changers' money, and overturned their tables;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And said to those who sold doves, Take these things away; do not make my Father's house a house of merchandise.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And his disciples remembered that it was written, Zeal for your house will consume me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Then the Jews answered and said to him, What sign do you show us, seeing that you do these things?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Jesus answered and said to them, Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Then the Jews said, It took forty-six years to build this temple, and will you raise it up in three days?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">But he spoke of the temple of his body.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Therefore, when he had risen from the dead, his disciples remembered he had said this to them; and they believed the scripture, and the word which Jesus had spoken.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Now when he was in Jerusalem at the passover, during the feast, many believed in his name, when they saw the miraculous signs which he did.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">But Jesus did not entrust himself to them, because he knew all men,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And needed no one to testify about man: for he himself knew what was in man.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="3">
      <VERS vnumber="1">There was a man of the Pharisees, named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">He came to Jesus by night, and said to him, Rabbi, we know that you are a teacher come from God: for no man can do the miraculous signs that you do, unless God is with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Jesus answered and said to him, Truly, truly, I say to you, Unless a man is born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Nicodemus said to him, How can a man be born when he is old? can he enter a second time into his mother's womb, and be born?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Jesus answered, Truly, truly, I say to you, Unless a man is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Do not marvel that I said to you, You must be born again.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">The wind blows where it wishes, and you hear the sound of it, but can not tell from where it comes, and where it goes: so it is with everyone who is born of the Spirit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Nicodemus answered and said to him, How can these things be?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Jesus answered and said to him, Are you a teacher of Israel, and do not know these things?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Truly, truly, I say to you, We speak what we know, and testify of what we have seen; but you do not receive our testimony.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">If I have told you earthly things, and you do not believe, how shall you believe, if I tell you of heavenly things?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">No man has ascended to heaven, but he who came down from heaven, the Son of man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so must the Son of man be lifted up:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">That whoever believes in him may have eternal life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish, but have eternal life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world might be saved through him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">He who believes in him is not condemned: but he who does not believe is condemned already, because he has not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And this is the judgment, that the light has come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">For everyone who does evil hates the light, and does not come to the light, lest his deeds should be exposed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">But he who practices the truth comes to the light, that his deeds may be shown to have been done through God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">After these things Jesus and his disciples came into the land of Judaea; and there he remained with them, and baptized.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And John also was baptizing in Aenon near Salim, because there was much water there: and people came, and were baptized.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">For John had not yet been cast into prison.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Then there arose a question between some of John's disciples and a Jew about purifying.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And they came to John, and said to him, Rabbi, he who was with you beyond the Jordan, to whom you bore witness, behold, he is baptizing, and all men are going to him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">John answered, A man can receive nothing, unless it has been given to him from heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">You yourselves bear me witness, that I said, I am not the Christ, but that I have been sent before him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">He who has the bride is the bridegroom: but the friend of the bridegroom, who stands and hears him, rejoices greatly because of the bridegroom's voice: therefore this joy of mine is fulfilled.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">He must increase, but I must decrease.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">He who comes from above is above all: he who is of the earth is earthly, and speaks of the earth: he who comes from heaven is above all.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">And what he has seen and heard, to that he testifies; yet no man receives his testimony.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">He who has received his testimony has set his seal to this, that God is true.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">For he whom God has sent speaks the words of God: for God gives the Spirit without measure.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">The Father loves the Son, and has given all things into his hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">He who believes in the Son has eternal life: but he who disobeys the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God rests upon him.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="4">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Therefore, when the Lord learned that the Pharisees had heard that Jesus made and baptized more disciples than John,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">(Though Jesus himself did not baptize, but his disciples,)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">He left Judaea, and departed again into Galilee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And he had to go through Samaria.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Then he came to a city of Samaria, which is called Sychar, near the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Now Jacob's well was there. Jesus, therefore, being wearied from his journey, sat by the well: and it was about the sixth hour.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">There came a woman of Samaria to draw water: Jesus said to her, Give me a drink.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">(For his disciples had gone away to the city to buy food.)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Then the woman of Samaria said to him, How is it that you, being a Jew, ask for a drink from me, a woman of Samaria? for the Jews have no dealings with the Samaritans.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Jesus answered and said to her, If you knew the gift of God, and who it is who says to you, Give me a drink; you would have asked him, and he would have given you living water.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">The woman said to him, Sir, you have nothing to draw with, and the well is deep: from where do you get that living water?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Are you greater than our father Jacob, who gave us the well, and drank from it himself, and his children, and his cattle?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Jesus answered and said to her, Whoever drinks of this water shall thirst again:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">But whoever drinks of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into eternal life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">The woman said to him, Sir, give me this water, that I may not thirst, nor come here to draw.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Jesus said to her, Go, call your husband, and come here.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">The woman answered and said, I have no husband. Jesus said to her, You have well said, I have no husband:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">For you have had five husbands; and he whom you now have is not your husband: in that you spoke truly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">The woman said to him, Sir, I perceive that you are a prophet.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Our fathers worshipped on this mountain; but you say that Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Jesus said to her, Woman, believe me, the hour comes when you shall worship the Father neither on this mountain, nor in Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">You do not know what you worship: we know what we worship: for salvation is from the Jews.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">But the hour comes, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth: for the Father seeks such to worship him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">God is Spirit: and those who worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">The woman said to him, I know that Messiah comes, who is called Christ: when he comes, he will tell us all things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Jesus said to her, I who speak to you am he.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And at this moment his disciples came, and marvelled that he was speaking with a woman: yet no one said, What do you seek? or, Why are you talking with her?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Then the woman left her waterpot, and went into the city, and said to the people,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Come, see a man who told me all that I ever did: is this not the Christ?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Then they went out of the city, and came to him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">In the meanwhile his disciples urged him, saying, Rabbi, eat.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">But he said to them, I have food to eat of which you know nothing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">Therefore the disciples said to one another, Has any man brought him food?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Jesus said to them, My food is to do the will of him who sent me, and to finish his work.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">Do you not say, There are yet four months, and then comes harvest? behold, I say to you, Lift up your eyes, and look on the fields; for they are already white for harvest.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">And he who reaps receives wages, and gathers fruit for life eternal: that both he who sows and he who reaps may rejoice together.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">And here the saying holds true, One sows, and another reaps.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">I sent you to reap that upon which you bestowed no labour: other men laboured, and you have entered into their labours.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">And many of the Samaritans of that city believed in him because of the words of the woman's testimony, He told me all that I ever did.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">So when the Samaritans came to him, they begged him to stay with them: and he stayed there two days.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">And many more believed because of his own word;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">And they said to the woman, Now we believe, no longer because of your words: for now we have heard him ourselves, and know that this is indeed the Christ, the Saviour of the world.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">Now after two days he departed from there, and went into Galilee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">For Jesus himself testified, that a prophet has no honour in his own country.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">When he came to Galilee, the Galilaeans welcomed him, having seen all the things that he did in Jerusalem at the feast: for they also went to the feast.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">So Jesus came again to Cana of Galilee, where he had made the water into wine. And there was a certain royal official, whose son was sick at Capernaum.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">When he heard that Jesus had come out of Judaea into Galilee, he went to him, and begged him to come down, and heal his son: for he was at the point of death.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">Then Jesus said to him, Unless you see signs and wonders, you will not believe.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">The royal official said to him, Sir, come down before my child dies.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">Jesus said to him, Go your way; your son lives. And the man believed the word that Jesus had spoken to him, and he went his way.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="51">And as he was going down, his servants met him, and told him, Your son lives.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="52">Then he enquired of them the hour when he began to mend. And they said to him, Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="53">Then the father realized that this was the very hour when Jesus said to him, Your son lives: and he believed, and his whole household.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="54">This was the second miraculous sign Jesus did after he came out of Judaea into Galilee.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="5">
      <VERS vnumber="1">After this there was a feast of the Jews; and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Now there is in Jerusalem by the sheep gate a pool, which is called in the Hebrew tongue Bethesda, and which has five porches.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">On these lay a great multitude of disabled, blind, lame, and paralysed people, [waiting for the moving of the water.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">For an angel went down at certain seasons into the pool, and stirred up the water: whoever then first stepped into the water after the stirring up was cured of whatever disease he had.]</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And a certain man was there, who had an infirmity for thirty-eight years.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">When Jesus saw him lying there, and knew that he had been a long time in that condition, he said to him, Do you want to be made well?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">The sick man answered him, Sir, I have no man to put me into the pool when the water is stirred up: but while I am coming, another steps down before me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Jesus said to him, Rise, take up your mat, and walk.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And immediately the man was made whole, and took up his mat, and walked: Now that day was the sabbath.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">The Jews therefore said to the man who was cured, It is the sabbath day: it is not lawful for you to carry your mat.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">He answered them, He who made me well said to me, Take up your mat, and walk.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Then they asked him, What man is it who said to you, Take up your mat, and walk?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">But the man who was healed did not know who it was: for Jesus had quietly withdrawn while there was a crowd in that place.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Afterward Jesus found him in the temple, and said to him, Behold, you have been made well: sin no more, lest something worse come upon you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">The man departed, and told the Jews that it was Jesus who had made him well.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And therefore the Jews persecuted Jesus, because he had done these things on the sabbath day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">But Jesus answered them, My Father works even until now, and I work.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Therefore the Jews sought all the more to kill him, because he not only had broken the sabbath, but also said that God was his Father, making himself equal with God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Then Jesus answered and said to them, Truly, truly, I say to you, The Son can do nothing by himself, but only what he sees the Father doing: for whatever things he does, these things the Son does likewise.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">For the Father loves the Son, and shows him all things that he is doing: and he will show him greater works than these, that you may marvel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">For as the Father raises up the dead, and gives them life; even so the Son gives life to whom he will.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">For the Father judges no man, but has committed all judgment to the Son:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">That all men should honour the Son, even as they honour the Father. He who does not honour the Son does not honour the Father who has sent him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Truly, truly, I say to you, He who hears my word, and believes him who sent me, has eternal life, and shall not come into judgment; but has passed from death into life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Truly, truly, I say to you, The hour is coming, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God: and those who hear shall live.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">For as the Father has life in himself; so he has granted to the Son to have life in himself;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And has given him authority to execute judgment, because he is the Son of man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Do not marvel at this: for the hour is coming, in which all who are in the tombs shall hear his voice,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And shall come forth; those who have done good, to the resurrection of life; and those who have done evil, to the resurrection of judgment.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">I can do nothing by myself: as I hear, I judge: and my judgment is just; because I do not seek my own will, but the will of him who sent me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">If I bear witness to myself, my witness is not true.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">There is another who bears witness of me; and I know that the witness which he bears of me is true.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">You sent to John, and he bore witness to the truth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Not that the testimony I receive is from man: but these things I say, that you might be saved.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">He was a burning and a shining light: and you were willing for a season to rejoice in his light.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">But I have a greater witness than that of John: for the works which the Father has given me to finish, the very works that I do, these bear witness of me, that the Father has sent me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">And the Father himself, who has sent me, has borne witness of me. You have neither heard his voice at any time, nor seen his form.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">And you do not have his word abiding in you: for you do not believe him whom he has sent.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">You search the scriptures; for in them you think you have eternal life: and it is they that testify of me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">Yet you will not come to me, that you might have life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">I do not receive honour from men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">But I know you, that you do not have the love of God in you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">I have come in my Father's name, and you do not receive me: if another shall come in his own name, him you will receive.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">How can you believe, when you receive honour from one another, and do not seek the honour that comes from him who alone is God?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">Do not think that I will accuse you to the Father: there is one who accuses you, Moses, in whom you trust.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">For had you believed Moses, you would have believed me: for he wrote of me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">But if you do not believe his writings, how shall you believe my words?</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="6">
      <VERS vnumber="1">After these things Jesus went over the sea of Galilee, that is, the sea of Tiberias.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And a great multitude followed him, because they saw the miraculous signs which he performed on those who were diseased.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And Jesus went up on the mountain, and there he sat with his disciples.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And the passover, the feast of the Jews, was near.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">When Jesus lifted up his eyes, and saw a great company coming to him, he said to Philip, Where shall we buy bread, that these may eat?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And this he said to test him: for he knew what he would do.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Philip answered him, Two hundred denarii of bread is not sufficient for every one of them to have a little.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">One of his disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, said to him,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">There is a lad here, who has five barley loaves, and two small fish: but what are they among so many?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And Jesus said, Make the people sit down. Now there was much grass in the place; so the men sat down, in number about five thousand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And Jesus took the loaves; and when he had given thanks, he distributed to those who were seated; and he did likewise with the fish, as much as they wanted.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">When they were filled, he said to his disciples, Gather up the fragments that remain, that nothing may be lost.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Therefore they gathered them together, and filled twelve baskets with the fragments of the five barley loaves left over by those who had eaten.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Then those men, when they had seen the miraculous sign that Jesus did, said, This is truly the prophet who is to come into the world.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">When Jesus perceived that they would come and take him by force, to make him a king, he departed again to the mountain by himself.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And when evening came, his disciples went down to the sea,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And entered into a boat, and went over the sea toward Capernaum. And it was now dark, and Jesus had not come to them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And the sea arose because of a great wind that blew.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">So when they had rowed about three or four miles, they saw Jesus walking on the sea, and drawing near to the boat: and they were afraid.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">But he said to them, It is I; do not be afraid.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Then they gladly received him into the boat: and immediately the boat was at the land where they were going.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">The day following, the people who stood on the other side of the sea saw that there was no other boat there, except the one into which his disciples had entered, and that Jesus did not go with his disciples into the boat, but that his disciples had gone away alone.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">But now some other boats came from Tiberias near to the place where they ate bread after the Lord had given thanks.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">When the people saw that Jesus was not there, nor his disciples, they got into the small boats, and came to Capernaum, seeking Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And when they had found him on the other side of the sea, they said to him, Rabbi, when did you come here?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Jesus answered them and said, Truly, truly, I say to you, You seek me, not because you saw the miraculous signs, but because you ate of the loaves, and were filled.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Do not labour for the food which perishes, but for that food which endures to eternal life, which the Son of man shall give to you: for on him has God the Father set his seal.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Then they said to him, What shall we do, that we might work the works of God?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Jesus answered and said to them, This is the work of God, that you believe in him whom he has sent.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Therefore they said to him, What sign do you show then, that we may see, and believe you? what work do you perform?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Our fathers ate manna in the desert; as it is written, He gave them bread from heaven to eat.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">Then Jesus said to them, Truly, truly, I say to you, Moses did not give you the bread from heaven; but my Father gives you the true bread from heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">For the bread of God is he who comes down from heaven, and gives life to the world.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Then they said to him, Lord, give us this bread always.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">And Jesus said to them, I am the bread of life: he who comes to me shall never hunger; and he who believes in me shall never thirst.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">But I said to you, That you have seen me, and do not believe.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">All those whom the Father gives me shall come to me; and he who comes to me I will by no means cast out.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">For I came down from heaven, not to do my own will, but the will of him who sent me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">And this is the will of him who sent me, that of all he has given me I should lose nothing, but should raise it up on the last day.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="11">I am the good shepherd: the good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">But he who is a hireling, and not the shepherd, who does not own the sheep, sees the wolf coming, and leaves the sheep, and flees: and the wolf attacks them, and scatters the sheep.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">The hireling flees, because he is a hireling, and does not care for the sheep.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">I am the good shepherd, and I know my own, and my own know me,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Just as the Father knows me, and I know the Father: and I lay down my life for the sheep.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And I have other sheep, which are not of this fold: I must bring them also, and they shall hear my voice; and there shall be one fold, and one shepherd.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Therefore my Father loves me, because I lay down my life, that I might take it up again.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">No man takes it from me, but I lay it down of my own accord. I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it up again. This commandment I have received from my Father.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">There was again a division among the Jews because of these words.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And many of them said, He has a devil, and is mad; why do you listen to him?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Others said, These are not the words of one who has a devil. Can a devil open the eyes of the blind?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And it was the feast of the dedication in Jerusalem, and it was winter.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And Jesus walked in the temple in Solomon's porch.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Then the Jews came round about him, and said to him, How long will you keep us in suspense? If you are the Christ, tell us plainly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Jesus answered them, I told you, and you do not believe: the works that I do in my Father's name, they bear witness of me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">But you do not believe, because you are not my sheep.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And I give them eternal life; and they shall never perish, nor shall any man pluck them out of my hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">My Father, who gave them to me, is greater than all; and no man is able to pluck them out of my Father's hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">I and the Father are one.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Then the Jews took up stones again to stone him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">Jesus answered them, I have shown you many good works from my Father; for which of those works do you stone me?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">The Jews answered him, saying, We do not stone you for a good work; but for blasphemy; because you, being a man, make yourself out to be God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Jesus answered them, Is it not written in your law, I said, You are gods?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">If he called them gods, to whom the word of God came, and the scripture cannot be broken;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">Do you say of him, whom the Father has sanctified, and sent into the world, You blaspheme; because I said, I am the Son of God?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">If I do not do the works of my Father, do not believe me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">But if I do them, though you do not believe me, believe the works: that you may know, and believe, that the Father is in me, and I am in the Father.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">Therefore they sought again to seize him: but he escaped from their hands,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">And went away again beyond the Jordan into the place where John first baptized; and there he abode.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">And many came to him, and said, John did no miraculous sign: but all things that John spoke of this man were true.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">And many believed in him there.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="11">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now a certain man named Lazarus was sick. He was of Bethany, the town of Mary and her sister Martha.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">(It was Mary who anointed the Lord with ointment, and wiped his feet with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was sick.)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Therefore his sisters sent to him, saying, Lord, behold, he whom you love is sick.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">When Jesus heard that, he said, This sickness is not to death, but for the glory of God, that the Son of God might be glorified through it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Now Jesus loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Therefore, when he heard that he was sick, he remained for two more days where he was.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Then after that he said to his disciples, Let us go to Judaea again.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">His disciples said to him, Rabbi, the Jews were just recently seeking to stone you; and would you go there again?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Jesus answered, Are there not twelve hours in the day? If any man walks in the day, he does not stumble, because he sees the light of this world.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">But if a man walks in the night, he stumbles, because there is no light in him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">These things he spoke: and then he said to them, Our friend Lazarus sleeps; but I go, that I may awaken him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Then his disciples said, Lord, if he is sleeping, he shall recover.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Yet Jesus spoke of his death: but they thought that he had spoken of natural sleep.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Then Jesus said to them plainly, Lazarus is dead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And I am glad for your sakes that I was not there, so that you may believe; but let us go to him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Then Thomas, who is called Didymus, said to his fellow disciples, Let us also go, that we may die with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">When Jesus came, he found that he had been in the tomb four days already.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Now Bethany was near Jerusalem, less than two miles off:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And many of the Jews came to Martha and Mary, to comfort them concerning their brother.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Then Martha, as soon as she heard that Jesus was coming, went and met him: but Mary sat in the house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Then Martha said to Jesus, Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">But I know, that even now, whatever you ask of God, God will give you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Jesus said to her, Your brother shall rise again.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Martha said to him, I know that he shall rise again in the resurrection on the last day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Jesus said to her, I am the resurrection, and the life: he who believes in me, though he die, yet shall he live:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And whoever lives and believes in me shall never die. Do you believe this?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">She said to him, Yes, Lord: I believe that you are the Christ, the Son of God, who was to come into the world.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And when she said this, she went her way, and called Mary her sister quietly, saying, The Teacher has come, and is calling for you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">As soon as she heard this, she rose quickly, and came to him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Now Jesus had not yet come into the town, but was still at the place where Martha had met him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">When the Jews who were with her in the house, comforting her, saw that Mary rose up hastily and went out, they followed her, supposing that she was going to the tomb to weep there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">Then when Mary came to where Jesus was, and saw him, she fell down at his feet, saying to him, Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">Therefore, when Jesus saw her weeping, and the Jews also weeping who came with her, he was deeply moved, and was troubled,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">And said, Where have you laid him? They said to him, Lord, come and see.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">Jesus wept.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">Then the Jews said, Behold how he loved him!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">But some of them said, Could not this man, who opened the eyes of the blind, have kept this man from dying?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">Jesus, again deeply moved within himself, came to the tomb. It was a cave, and a stone lay upon it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">Jesus said, Take away the stone. Martha, the sister of the dead man, said to him, Lord, by this time he stinks: for he has been dead four days.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">Jesus said to her, Did I not say to you, that, if you would believe, you would see the glory of God?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">Then they took away the stone. And Jesus lifted up his eyes, and said, Father, I thank you that you have heard me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">And I knew that you always hear me: but because of the people who stand here I said it, that they may believe that you have sent me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">And when he had said this, he cried out with a loud voice, Lazarus, come forth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">And the dead man came forth, bound hand and foot with graveclothes: and his face was wrapped with a cloth. Jesus said to them, Unbind him, and let him go.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">Then many of the Jews who came with Mary, and had seen the things which Jesus did, believed in him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">But some of them went away to the Pharisees, and told them the things Jesus had done.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">Then the chief priests and the Pharisees gathered a council, and said, What should we do? for this man performs many miraculous signs.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">If we let him go on like this, all men will believe in him: and the Romans shall come and take away both our place and our nation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">And one of them, named Caiaphas, who was the high priest that year, said to them, You know nothing at all,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">Nor do you consider that it is expedient for you, that one man should die for the people, so that the whole nation should not perish.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="51">And this he did not speak of his own accord: but being high priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus should die for the nation;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="52">And not for that nation only, but also that he should gather together into one the children of God who are scattered abroad.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="53">Then from that day forth they planned together how to put him to death.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="54">Therefore Jesus no longer walked openly among the Jews; but went away from there to a region near the wilderness, into a city called Ephraim, and there he stayed with his disciples.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="55">And the Jewish passover was near at hand: and many from the country went up to Jerusalem before the passover, to purify themselves.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="56">They sought for Jesus, and spoke among themselves, as they stood in the temple, What do you think, that he will not come to the feast?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="57">Now the chief priests and the Pharisees had given a commandment, that, if any man knew where he was, he should report it, that they might seize him.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="12">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Six days before the passover Jesus came to Bethany, where Lazarus was, whom Jesus raised from the dead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">There they made him a supper; and Martha served: and Lazarus was one of those at the table with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Then Mary took a pound of ointment of pure nard, very costly, and anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped his feet with her hair: and the house was filled with the fragrance of the ointment.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Then one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot, who would later betray him, said,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Why was this ointment not sold for three hundred denarii, and given to the poor?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">He said this, not because he cared for the poor; but because he was a thief, and had the money box, and stole what was put in it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Then Jesus said, Let her alone: she has kept it for the day of my burial.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">For the poor you have with you always; but me you do not always have.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Now a large multitude of the Jews learned that he was there: and they came not only because of Jesus, but also that they might see Lazarus, whom he had raised from the dead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">But the chief priests discussed how they might put Lazarus to death also;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Because on account of him many of the Jews went away, and believed in Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">On the next day many people who had come to the feast, when they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Took branches of palm trees, and went forth to meet him, and cried out, Hosanna: Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord, even the King of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And Jesus, when he had found a young donkey, sat on it; as it is written,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Fear not, daughter of Zion: behold, your King comes, sitting on a donkey's colt.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">These things his disciples did not understand at first: but when Jesus was glorified, then they remembered that these things were written of him, and that they had done these things to him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Now the people who were with him when he called Lazarus out of his grave, and raised him from the dead, kept bearing witness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">For this cause also the people went out to meet him, because they heard that he had done this miraculous sign.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Therefore the Pharisees said among themselves, You see, you have accomplished nothing: behold, the world has gone after him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And there were certain Greeks among those who came up to worship at the feast:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">They came to Philip, who was from Bethsaida of Galilee, and said to him, Sir, we want to see Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Philip came and told Andrew: then Andrew and Philip told Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And Jesus answered them, saying, The hour has come for the Son of man to be glorified.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Truly, truly, I say to you, Unless a grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it remains alone: but if it dies, it brings forth much fruit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">He who loves his life shall lose it; and he who hates his life in this world shall keep it for life eternal.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">If any man serves me, let him follow me; and where I am, there shall my servant be also: if any man serves me, the Father will honour him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Now is my soul troubled; and shall I say, Father, save me from this hour? but it is for this reason that I came to this hour.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Father, glorify your name. Then there came a voice from heaven, saying, I have both glorified it, and will glorify it again.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">The crowd that stood by, and heard it, said that it thundered: others said, An angel spoke to him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Jesus answered and said, This voice came not for me, but for your sakes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Now is the judgment of this world: now shall the prince of this world be cast out.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men to myself.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">This he said, to signify what sort of death he should die.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">The people answered him, We have heard out of the law that the Christ abides forever: and how is it that you say, The Son of man must be lifted up? who is this Son of man?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">Then Jesus said to them, Yet for a little while is the light with you. Walk while you have the light, lest darkness overtake you: for he who walks in darkness does not know where he goes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">While you have light, believe in the light, that you may be sons of light. These things Jesus spoke, and departed, and hid himself from them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">But though he had done so many miraculous signs before them, yet they did not believe in him:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">That the word spoken by Isaiah the prophet might be fulfilled, Lord, who has believed our report? and to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">Therefore they could not believe, because as Isaiah also said,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">He has blinded their eyes, and hardened their heart; that they should not see with their eyes, nor understand with their hearts, and turn to me, that I should heal them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">These things Isaiah said because he saw his glory and spoke of him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">Nevertheless, even among the chief rulers, many believed in him; but because of the Pharisees they did not confess him, lest they should be put out of the synagogue:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">For they loved the praise of men more than the praise of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">Jesus cried out and said, He who believes in me, believes not in me, but in him who sent me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">And he who sees me sees him who sent me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">I have come as a light into the world, that whoever believes in me should not abide in darkness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">And if any man hears my words, and does not believe, I do not judge him: for I did not come to judge the world, but to save the world.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">He who rejects me, and does not receive my words, has one who judges him: the word that I have spoken, that shall judge him on the last day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">For I have not spoken of my own accord; but the Father who sent me, he commanded what I should say, and what I should speak.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">And I know that his commandment is life eternal: therefore, whatever I speak, I speak as the Father has bidden me.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="13">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now before the feast of the passover, when Jesus knew that his hour had come to depart out of this world to the Father, having loved his own who were in the world, he loved them to the end.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">It was during supper, and the devil had already put into the heart of Judas Iscariot, Simon's son, to betray Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Knowing that the Father had given all things into his hands, and that he had come from God, and was returning to God;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Jesus rose from supper, and laid aside his garments; and took a towel, and girded himself.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">After that he poured water into a basin, and began to wash the disciples' feet, and to wipe them with the towel with which he was girded.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Then he came to Simon Peter: and Peter said to him, Lord, do you wash my feet?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Jesus answered and said to him, What I do you do not understand now; but you shall understand later.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Peter said to him, You shall never wash my feet. Jesus answered him, If I do not wash you, you have no part with me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Simon Peter said to him, Lord, not only my feet, but also my hands and my head.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Jesus said to him, He who has bathed needs only to wash his feet, but he is clean all over: and you are clean, but not all of you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">For he knew who would betray him; therefore he said, Not all of you are clean.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">So after he had washed their feet, and had put on his garments, and had taken his place again, he said to them, Do you know what I have done to you?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">You call me Teacher and Lord: and you say well; for so I am.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">If I then, your Lord and Teacher, have washed your feet; you also ought to wash one another's feet.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">For I have given you an example, that you should do as I have done to you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Truly, truly, I say to you, The servant is not greater than his lord; neither is he who is sent greater than he who sent him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">If you know these things, happy are you if you do them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">I do not speak of all of you: I know whom I have chosen: but it is that the scripture may be fulfilled, He who eats bread with me has lifted up his heel against me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Now I tell you before it happens, that, when it has come to pass, you may believe that I am he.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Truly, truly, I say to you, He who receives whomever I send receives me; and he who receives me receives him who sent me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">When Jesus had said this, he was troubled in spirit, and testified, Truly, truly, I say to you, that one of you shall betray me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Then the disciples looked at one another, uncertain of whom he spoke.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Now there was leaning on Jesus' bosom one of his disciples, whom Jesus loved.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Therefore Simon Peter beckoned to him, that he should ask of whom he spoke.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">He, lying on Jesus' breast, said to him, Lord, who is it?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Jesus answered, It is he to whom I shall give this morsel, when I have dipped it. And when he had dipped the morsel, he gave it to Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And after the morsel, Satan entered into him. Then Jesus said to him, What you do, do quickly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Now no man at the table knew why he spoke this to him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Some of them thought, because Judas had the money box, that Jesus had said to him, Buy those things that we need for the feast; or, that he should give something to the poor.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Having received the morsel he went out immediately: and it was night.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">When he had gone out, Jesus said, Now is the Son of man glorified, and God is glorified in him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">If God is glorified in him, God shall also glorify him in himself, and shall immediately glorify him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">Little children, yet a little while I am with you. You shall seek me: and as I said to the Jews, so now I say to you: Where I go, you cannot come.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">A new commandment I give to you, That you love one another; as I have loved you, so you also love one another.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">By this shall all men know that you are my disciples, if you have love for one another.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">Simon Peter said to him, Lord, where are you going? Jesus answered him, Where I go, you cannot follow me now; but you shall follow me afterwards.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">Peter said to him, Lord, why can I not follow you now? I will lay down my life for your sake.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">Jesus answered him, Will you lay down your life for my sake? Truly, truly, I say to you, The cock shall not crow, until you have denied me thrice.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">When Jesus had spoken these words, he went forth with his disciples over the ravine of the Kedron, to where there was a garden into which he and his disciples entered.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And Judas also, who betrayed him, knew the place: for Jesus often met there with his disciples.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Judas then, having received a band of men and officers from the chief priests and Pharisees, came there with lanterns and torches and weapons.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Then Jesus, knowing all that would come upon him, went forth, and said to them, Whom do you seek?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">They answered him, Jesus of Nazareth. Jesus said to them, I am he. And Judas, who betrayed him, stood with them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">As soon as he had said to them, I am he, they drew back, and fell to the ground.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Then he asked them again, Whom do you seek? And they said, Jesus of Nazareth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Jesus answered, I have told you that I am he: therefore if you seek me, let these men go their way:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">This happened so that what he had spoken might be fulfilled, Of those whom you gave me I have lost none.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Then Simon Peter, having a sword, drew it, and struck the high priest's servant, cutting off his right ear. The servant's name was Malchus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Then Jesus said to Peter, Put your sword into its sheath: the cup which my Father has given me, shall I not drink it?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Then the band and the captain and officers of the Jews took Jesus, and bound him,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And led him first to Annas; for he was father-in-law to Caiaphas, who was the high priest that year.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Now Caiaphas was the one, who gave counsel to the Jews, that it was expedient that one man should die for the people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And Simon Peter followed Jesus, as did another disciple: that disciple was known to the high priest, and went with Jesus into the court of the high priest.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">But Peter stood outside at the door. Then the other disciple, who was known to the high priest, went out and spoke to her who kept the door, and brought in Peter.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Then the maid who kept the door said to Peter, Are you not also one of this man's disciples? He said, I am not.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Now the servants and officers who stood there had made a fire of coals; for it was cold: and they warmed themselves: and Peter stood with them, and warmed himself.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">The high priest then asked Jesus about his disciples, and about his teaching.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Jesus answered him, I spoke openly to the world; I always taught in the synagogue, and in the temple, where the Jews all come together; and I said nothing in secret.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Why do you ask me? ask those who heard what I spoke to them: they know what I said.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And when he had said this, one of the officers who stood by struck Jesus with the palm of his hand, saying, Is that how you answer the high priest?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Jesus answered him, If I have spoken evil, bear witness of the evil: but if well, why do you strike me?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Then Annas sent him bound to Caiaphas the high priest.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And Simon Peter stood and warmed himself. They said to him, Are you not also one of his disciples? He denied it, and said, I am not.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">One of the servants of the high priest, a kinsman of the man whose ear Peter cut off, said, Did I not see you in the garden with him?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Peter denied it again: and immediately the cock crowed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Then they led Jesus from Caiaphas to the praetorium: and it was early; and they themselves did not go into the praetorium, so they would not be defiled, but might eat the passover.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Pilate then went out to them, and said, What accusation do you bring against this man?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">They answered and said to him, If he were not an evildoer, we would not have delivered him up to you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Then Pilate said to them, You take him and judge him according to your own law. The Jews said to him, It is not lawful for us to put any man to death:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">This was so the word of Jesus might be fulfilled, which he spoke to signify what kind of death he should die.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">Then Pilate entered the praetorium again, and called Jesus, and said to him, Are you the King of the Jews?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Jesus answered him, Do you say this of your own accord, or did others tell you of me?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">Pilate answered, Am I a Jew? Your own nation and the chief priests have delivered you up to me: what have you done?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">Jesus answered, My kingdom is not of this world: if my kingdom were of this world, then my servants would fight, that I should not be delivered up to the Jews: but my kingdom is not of this world.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">So Pilate said to him, You are a king then? Jesus answered, You say that I am a king. To this end was I born, and for this cause I came into the world, that I should bear witness to the truth. Every one who is of the truth hears my voice.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">Pilate said to him, What is truth? And when he had said this, he went out again to the Jews, and said to them, I find no fault in him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">But you have a custom, for me to release someone to you at the passover: do you want me to release to you the King of the Jews?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">Then they all cried again, saying, Not this man, but Barabbas. Now Barabbas was a robber.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Then Pilate took Jesus, and scourged him.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">And came up to him and said, Hail, King of the Jews! and struck him with their hands.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Pilate went forth again, and said to them, Behold, I bring him forth to you, that you may know that I find no fault in him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Then Jesus came forth, wearing the crown of thorns, and the purple robe. And Pilate said to them, Behold the man!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">When the chief priests and officers saw him, they cried out, saying, Crucify him, crucify him. Pilate said to them, You take him and crucify him: for I find no fault in him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">The Jews answered him, We have a law, and by our law he ought to die, because he made himself out to be the Son of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">When Pilate heard these words, he was even more afraid;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And went again into the praetorium, and said to Jesus, Where are you from? But Jesus gave him no answer.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Then Pilate said to him, You do not speak to me? do you not know that I have power to release you, and power to crucify you?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Jesus answered, You would have no power over me unless it was given to you from above: therefore he who delivered me to you has the greater sin.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And from then Pilate sought to release him: but the Jews cried out, saying, If you let this man go, you are no friend of Caesar's: whoever makes himself a king sets himself against Caesar.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">When Pilate heard these words, he brought Jesus forth, and sat down in the judgment seat in a place that is called the Pavement, but in the Hebrew, Gabbatha.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And it was the day of preparation for the passover, about the sixth hour: and he said to the Jews, Behold your King!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">But they cried out, Away with him, away with him, crucify him. Pilate said to them, Shall I crucify your King? The chief priests answered, We have no king but Caesar.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Then he delivered him to them to be crucified.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And they took Jesus and led him away, and he, bearing his cross, went forth to a place called the place of a skull, which is called in Hebrew, Golgotha:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Where they crucified him, and two others with him, one on either side and Jesus in the middle.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And Pilate wrote a title, and put it on the cross. And the writing was, JESUS OF NAZARETH, THE KING OF THE JEWS.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Many of the Jews read this title: for the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city: and it was written in Hebrew, and Latin, and Greek.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Then the chief priests of the Jews said to Pilate, Do not write, The King of the Jews; but that he said, I am King of the Jews.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Pilate answered, What I have written I have written.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Then the soldiers, when they had crucified Jesus, took his garments, and made four parts, to every soldier a part; and also his coat: now the coat was without seam, woven from the top throughout.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Therefore they said among themselves, Let us not tear it, but cast lots for it, to decide whose it shall be. This was so the scripture might be fulfilled, which says, They divided my garments among them, and for my clothing they cast lots. Therefore the soldiers did these things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Now by the cross of Jesus stood his mother, and his mother's sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">When Jesus saw his mother, and the disciple whom he loved, standing by, he said to his mother, Woman, behold your son!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Then he said to the disciple, Behold your mother! And from that hour that disciple took her into his own home.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">After this, Jesus, knowing that all things were now accomplished, said in fulfillment of the scripture, I thirst.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Now there was a vessel full of vinegar set there: and they soaked a sponge with vinegar, and put it upon a hyssop branch, and held it to his mouth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">When Jesus received the vinegar, he said, It is finished: and he bowed his head, and gave up his spirit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Because it was the day of preparation, in order that the bodies would not remain upon the cross during the sabbath day (for that sabbath day was a high day,) the Jews asked Pilate that their legs might be broken, and that they might be taken away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">The soldiers came and broke the legs of the first, and of the other who was crucified with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">But when they came to Jesus, and saw that he was dead already, they did not break his legs:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">But one of the soldiers pierced his side with a spear, and immediately there came out blood and water.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">And he who saw it has borne witness, and his witness is true: and he knows what he says is true, that you also might believe.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">For these things came to pass that the scripture should be fulfilled, Not one of his bones shall be broken.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">And again another scripture says, They shall look on him whom they have pierced.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">After this, Joseph of Arimathaea, being a disciple of Jesus, but secretly for fear of the Jews, asked Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus: and Pilate gave him permission. Therefore he came and took his body.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">And Nicodemus also came, who first came to Jesus by night, and brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about a hundred pounds' weight.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">They took the body of Jesus, and bound it in linen cloths with the spices, as is the burial custom of the Jews.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">Now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden; and in the garden a new tomb, in which no one had yet been laid.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">Because of the Jewish day of preparation, as the tomb was near at hand, they laid Jesus there.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="20">
      <VERS vnumber="1">The first day of the week Mary Magdalene came early, when it was yet dark, to the tomb, and saw the stone taken away from the tomb.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Then she ran, and came to Simon Peter, and to the other disciple, whom Jesus loved, and said to them, They have taken away the Lord out of the tomb, and we do not know where they have laid him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Therefore Peter went forth, with the other disciple, toward the tomb.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">So they both ran together: and the other disciple outran Peter, and came first to the tomb.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And he stooped down, and looked in, and saw the linen wrappings lying there; but he did not go in.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Then Simon Peter came, following him, and went into the tomb, and saw the linen wrappings lying there,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And the cloth, which had been around his head, was not lying with the linen wrappings, but was rolled up in a place by itself.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Then the other disciple, who came first to the tomb, went in also and he saw, and believed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">For as yet they did not understand the scripture, that he must rise again from the dead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Then the disciples went away again to their own homes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">But Mary stood outside the tomb weeping: and as she wept, she stooped down, and looked into the tomb,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And saw two angels in white sitting, one at the head, and the other at the feet, where the body of Jesus had lain.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And they said to her, Woman, why do you weep? She said to them, Because they have taken away my Lord, and I do not know where they have laid him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And when she had said this, she turned around, and saw Jesus standing, but did not know that it was Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Jesus said to her, Woman, why do you weep? whom do you seek? She, supposing him to be the gardener, said to him, Sir, if you have carried him away, tell me where you have laid him, and I will take him away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Jesus said to her, Mary. She turned, and said to him, Rabboni; which is to say, Teacher.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Jesus said to her, Do not hold me; for I have not yet ascended to my Father: but go to my brethren, and say to them, I ascend to my Father, and your Father; and to my God, and your God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Mary Magdalene came and told the disciples that she had seen the Lord, and that he had spoken these things to her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Then at evening of the same day, the first day of the week, when the doors were shut where the disciples were assembled for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood in their midst, and said to them, Peace be with you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And when he had said this, he showed them his hands and his side. The disciples were overjoyed when they saw the Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Then Jesus said to them again, Peace be with you: as my Father has sent me, even so I send you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And when he had said this, he breathed on them, and said to them, Receive the Holy Spirit:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">If you forgive the sins of any one, they are forgiven; if you retain the sins of any one, they are retained.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">But Thomas, one of the twelve, called Didymus, was not with them when Jesus came.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">The other disciples said to him, We have seen the Lord. But he said to them, Unless I shall see in his hands the mark of the nails, and put my finger into the print of the nails, and thrust my hand into his side, I will not believe.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">After eight days his disciples were again inside, and Thomas with them: then Jesus came, though the doors were shut, and stood in their midst, and said, Peace be with you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Then he said to Thomas, Reach here with your finger, and behold my hands; and reach here with your hand, and thrust it into my side: and do not be faithless, but believing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And Thomas said to him, My Lord and my God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Jesus said to him, Because you have seen me, you have believed: blessed are those who have not seen, and yet have believed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Now Jesus performed many other miraculous signs in the presence of his disciples, which are not written in this book:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">But these are written, that you might believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God; and that believing you might have life through his name.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="21">
      <VERS vnumber="1">After these things Jesus showed himself again to the disciples by the sea of Tiberias; and he showed himself in this way:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Simon Peter, Thomas called Didymus, Nathanael of Cana in Galilee, the sons of Zebedee, and two other of his disciples were together.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Simon Peter said to them, I am going fishing. They said to him, We will go with you. They went forth, and entered a boat; but that night they caught nothing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">But when the morning was breaking, Jesus stood on the shore: but the disciples did not know that it was Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Then Jesus said to them, Children, have you any fish? They answered him, No.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And he said to them, Cast the net on the right side of the boat, and you shall find some. Therefore they cast it, and they were not able to draw it in because of the multitude of fish.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Therefore the disciple whom Jesus loved said to Peter, It is the Lord. Now when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he put on his outer garment, (for he was stripped for work,) and cast himself into the sea.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And the other disciples came in the boat; (for they were not far from land, only about a hundred yards,) dragging the net full of fish.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">As soon as they had come to land, they saw a fire of coals there, and fish laid on it, and bread.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Jesus said to them, Bring some of the fish which you have caught.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Simon Peter went up, and drew the net to land, full of great fish, a hundred and fifty-three: and though there were so many, yet the net was not broken.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Jesus said to them, Come and have breakfast. And none of the disciples dared ask him, Who are you? knowing that it was the Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Then Jesus came, and took bread, and gave it to them, and did the same with the fish.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">This was now the third time that Jesus showed himself to his disciples, after he had risen from the dead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">So when they had eaten, Jesus said to Simon Peter, Simon, son of John, do you love me more than these? He said to him, Yes, Lord; you know that I love you. He said to him, Feed my lambs.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">He said to him a second time, Simon, son of John, do you love me? He said to him, Yes, Lord; you know that I love you. He said to him, Tend my sheep.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">He said to him a third time, Simon, son of John, do you love me? Peter was grieved because he said to him the third time, Do you love me? And he said to him, Lord, you know all things; you know that I love you. Jesus said to him, Feed my sheep.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Truly, truly, I say to you, When you were young, you girded yourself, and walked where you wanted: but when you grow old, you shall stretch forth your hands, and another shall gird you, and carry you where you do not want to go.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">This he spoke to signify by what kind of death he would glorify God. And when he had spoken this, he said to him, Follow me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Then Peter, turning about, saw the disciple whom Jesus loved following; the one who had leaned on his breast at supper, and said, Lord, who is the one who betrays you?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Peter, seeing him, said to Jesus, Lord, what about this man?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Jesus said to him, If I want him to remain until I come, what is that to you? you follow me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Then this saying went abroad among the brethren, that this disciple should not die: yet Jesus did not said to him, He shall not die; but, If I want him to remain until I come, what is that to you?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">This is the disciple who testifies of these things, and wrote these things: and we know that his testimony is true.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And there are also many other things which Jesus did, which, if every one of them were to be written, I suppose that even the world itself could not contain the books that would be written.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
  </BIBLEBOOK>
  <BIBLEBOOK bnumber="44">
    <CHAPTER cnumber="1">
      <VERS vnumber="1">In my former treatise, O Theophilus, I wrote of all that Jesus began to do and teach,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Until the day he was taken up, after he had, through the Holy Spirit, given commands to the apostles whom he had chosen.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">To them he showed himself alive after his suffering by many infallible proofs, being seen by them over forty days, and speaking of the things concerning the kingdom of God:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And, while eating with them, commanded them not to depart from Jerusalem, but to wait for the promise of the Father, of which, he said, you have heard me speak.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">For John baptized with water; but you shall be baptized with the Holy Spirit not many days from now.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">When they had come together, they asked him, saying, Lord, will you at this time restore the kingdom to Israel?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And he said to them, It is not for you to know the times or the seasons, which the Father has fixed by his own authority.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">But you shall receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you: and you shall be witnesses to me both in Jerusalem, and in all Judaea, and in Samaria, and to the remotest part of the earth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And when he had spoken these things, while they watched, he was taken up; and a cloud received him out of their sight.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And while they looked steadfastly toward heaven as he went up, behold, two men stood by them in white apparel;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Who said, You men of Galilee, why do you stand gazing up into heaven? this same Jesus, who has been taken up from you into heaven, shall come in the same way that you have seen him go into heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Then they returned to Jerusalem from the mount called Olivet, which is from Jerusalem a sabbath day's journey.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And when they had come in, they went into an upper room where they were staying; Peter, and John, and James, and Andrew, Philip, and Thomas, Bartholomew, and Matthew, James the son of Alphaeus, and Simon the Zealot, and Judas the son of James.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">They all continued with one accord in prayer, with the women, and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with his brothers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">In those days Peter stood up in the midst of the disciples, and said, (together they were about a hundred and twenty,)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Brethren, this scripture had to be fulfilled, which the Holy Spirit spoke by the mouth of David concerning Judas, who was the guide to those who arrested Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">For he was numbered with us, and had his part in this ministry.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">(Now this man purchased a field with the reward of his wickedness; and falling headlong, he burst apart in the middle, and all his bowels gushed out.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And it became known to all who dwelt in Jerusalem; so that the field is called in their tongue, Akeldama, that is to say, The field of blood.)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">For it is written in the book of Psalms, Let his habitation become desolate, and let no man live in it: and his office let another take.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Therefore, of those men who have accompanied us all the time that the Lord Jesus went in and out among us,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Beginning with the baptism of John until the day that he was taken up from us, one of these must be ordained to be a witness with us of his resurrection.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And they appointed two, Joseph called Barsabbas, who was surnamed Justus, and Matthias.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And they prayed, and said, You, Lord, who know the hearts of all men, show which of these two you have chosen,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">To take part in this ministry and apostleship, from which Judas turned aside, that he might go to his own place.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And they drew lots for them; and the lot fell to Matthias; and he was numbered with the eleven apostles.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="2">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And when the day of Pentecost had come, they were all together in one place.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind, and it filled all the house where they were sitting.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And there appeared to them tongues, as of fire, which separated and came to rest upon each of them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And there were dwelling in Jerusalem Jews, devout men, out of every nation under heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Now when this sound was heard, the multitude came together, and were bewildered, because every one heard them speak in his own language.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And they were all amazed and marvelled, saying one to another, Behold, are not all these who speak Galilaeans?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And how is it we each hear them in our own tongue, in the language to which we were born?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Parthians, and Medes, and Elamites, and dwellers in Mesopotamia, and in Judaea, and Cappadocia, in Pontus, and Asia,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Phrygia, and Pamphylia, in Egypt, and in the parts of Libya around Cyrene, and strangers from Rome, both Jews and proselytes,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Cretans and Arabs, we hear them speak in our tongues of the mighty works of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And they were all amazed, and were in doubt, saying one to another, What does this mean?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Others said mockingly, These men are full of new wine.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">But Peter, standing up with the eleven, lifted up his voice, and said to them, You men of Judaea, and all you who live in Jerusalem, let this be known to you, and listen to my words:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">For these men are not drunk, as you suppose, for it is only the third hour of the day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">But this is that which was spoken of by the prophet Joel;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And it shall come to pass in the last days, declares God, That I will pour out my Spirit upon all flesh: and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, and your young men shall see visions, and your old men shall dream dreams:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And in those days I will pour out my Spirit on my menservants and on my maidservants; and they shall prophesy:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And I will show wonders in heaven above, and signs on the earth beneath; blood, and fire, and vapour of smoke:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before the great and glorious day of the Lord shall come:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And it shall come to pass, that whoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">You men of Israel, hear these words; Jesus of Nazareth, a man attested to you by God with miracles and wonders and signs, which God performed by him in your midst, as you yourselves know:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">This man, being delivered up by the definite plan and foreknowledge of God, you have taken, and by the hands of wicked men have crucified and slain.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">But God has raised him up, having freed him from the pains of death: because it was not possible that he should be held by it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">For David speaks of him, I saw the Lord always before my face, for he is on my right hand, that I should not be shaken:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Therefore did my heart rejoice, and my tongue was glad; moreover my flesh shall also abide in hope:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Because you will not leave my soul in Hades, neither will you allow your Holy One to see decay.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">You have made known to me the ways of life; you shall make me full of joy with your presence.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Brethren, let me say confidently to you of the patriarch David; that he is both dead and buried, and his tomb is with us to this day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Therefore, being a prophet, and knowing that God had sworn with an oath that he would seat one of his descendants upon his throne;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">He foresaw this and spoke of the resurrection of Christ, that his soul was not left in Hades, neither did his flesh see corruption.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">This Jesus God has raised up, of which we are all witnesses.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">Therefore, being exalted at the right hand of God, and having received from the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit, he has poured forth this, which you now see and hear.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">For David did not ascend into the heavens: but he himself says, The LORD said to my Lord, Sit on my right hand,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">Until I make your foes a footstool for your feet.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">Therefore, let all the house of Israel know assuredly, that God has made this Jesus, whom you crucified, both Lord and Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">Now when they heard this, they were pricked to the heart, and said to Peter and to the rest of the apostles, Brethren, what shall we do?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">Then Peter said to them, Repent, and let every one of you be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">For the promise is for you, and for your children, and for all who are far off, even as many as the Lord our God shall call.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">And with many other words did he testify and exhort them, saying, Save yourselves from this perverse generation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">Then those who received his word were baptized: and that same day there were added to their number about three thousand souls.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">And they continued steadfastly in the apostles' teaching and fellowship, and in the breaking of bread, and in prayer.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">And fear came upon every soul: and many wonders and signs were done through the apostles.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">And all who believed were together, and had all things in common;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">And they sold their possessions and goods, and distributed them to all men, as every man had need.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">And they continued daily to assemble in the temple, and to break bread from house to house, and to eat their food with gladness and sincerity of heart,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">Praising God, and having favour with all the people. And the Lord added to their number daily those who were being saved.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="3">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now Peter and John went up together to the temple at the hour of prayer, the ninth hour.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And a certain man, lame from his mother's womb, was being carried to the temple gate which is called Beautiful, where they laid him daily to ask for alms from those who entered into the temple;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Seeing Peter and John about to go into the temple, he asked for alms.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And Peter, fastening his eyes upon him with John, said, Look at us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And he gave his attention to them, expecting to receive something from them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Then Peter said, Of silver and gold I have none; but what I have I give to you: In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, walk!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And he took him by the right hand, and lifted him up: and immediately his feet and ankles received strength.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And leaping up he stood, and walked, and entered with them into the temple, walking, and leaping, and praising God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And all the people saw him walking and praising God:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And they knew that it was the one who sat begging for alms at the Beautiful gate of the temple: and they were filled with wonder and amazement at that which had happened to him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And as he clung to Peter and John, all the people ran together to them in the porch that is called Solomon's, greatly amazed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And when Peter saw it, he answered the people, You men of Israel, why do you marvel at this? or why do you look so earnestly at us, as though by our own power or holiness we made this man walk?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">The God of Abraham, and of Isaac, and of Jacob, the God of our fathers, has glorified his Son Jesus; whom you delivered up, and denied in the presence of Pilate, when he had decided to let him go.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">But you denied the Holy and Just One, and asked for a murderer to be granted to you;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And killed the Prince of life, whom God has raised from the dead. Of this we are witnesses.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And his name, through faith in his name, has made this man strong, whom you see and know: and the faith which is through Jesus has given him this perfect health in the presence of you all.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And now, brethren, I know that you acted in ignorance, as did your rulers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">But those things which God foretold by the mouths of all his prophets, that his Christ should suffer, he has fulfilled.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Therefore repent, and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out, that times of refreshing may come from the presence of the Lord;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And that he may send the Christ, who was appointed for you, even Jesus:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Whom heaven must receive until the time of the restoration of all things which God has spoken about by the mouths of all his holy prophets since the most ancient times.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">For Moses said, The Lord your God shall raise up for you a prophet like me from among your brethren; you shall hear him in all things, whatever he shall say to you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And it shall come to pass, that anyone who will not hear that prophet, shall be destroyed from among the people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Yea, and all the prophets, from Samuel and those who followed after, as many as have spoken, have foretold these days.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">You are the children of the prophets, and of the covenant which God made with your fathers, saying to Abraham, And in your seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="13">Now when they saw the boldness of Peter and John, and perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant men, they marvelled; and they recognized that they had been with Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And beholding the man who was healed standing with them, they could say nothing against it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">But when they had commanded them to go aside, out of the council, they conferred among themselves,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Saying, What shall we do with these men? for that a notable miracle has indeed been done by them is apparent to everyone who lives in Jerusalem; and we cannot deny it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">But that it may spread no further among the people, let us sternly warn them, that they speak no more to any man in this name.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And they called them, and commanded them not to speak or teach at all in the name of Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">But Peter and John answered and said to them, Whether it is right in the sight of God to listen to you more than to God, judge for yourselves.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">But we cannot but speak the things which we have seen and heard.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">So when they had threatened them further, they let them go, finding no way to punish them, because of the people: for everyone glorified God for what had been done.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">For the man was more than forty years old, on whom this miracle of healing was performed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And being let go, they went to their own people, and reported all that the chief priests and elders had said to them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And when they heard this, they lifted up their voices to God with one accord, and said, Lord, you are he who made the heaven, and earth, and the sea, and all that is in them:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Who by the mouth of our father David said, Why did the Gentiles rage, and the people imagine vain things?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">The kings of the earth took their stand, and the rulers were gathered together against the Lord, and against his Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">For truly in this city, against your holy servant Jesus, whom you have anointed, both Herod, and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles and the people of Israel, were gathered together,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="29">And now, Lord, behold their threatenings, and grant to your servants that they may speak your word with all boldness,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">while you stretch forth your hand to heal, and signs and wonders are done through the name of your holy servant Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">And when they had prayed, the place where they were assembled was shaken; and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and they spoke the word of God with boldness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">And the multitude of those who believed were of one heart and of one soul: and no one said that any of the things which he possessed was his own; but they had all things in common.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">And with great power the apostles gave witness of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus: and great grace was upon them all.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="35">And laid them down at the apostles' feet: and distribution was made to each according to his need.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">And Joseph, a Levite from Cyprus, who was surnamed by the apostles Barnabas, (which means, The son of encouragement,)</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="5">
      <VERS vnumber="1">But a certain man named Ananias, with Sapphira his wife, sold a piece of property,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">But Peter said, Ananias, why has Satan filled your heart to lie to the Holy Spirit, and to keep back part of the price of the land?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">While it was unsold, was it not your own? and even after it was sold, was not the money in your own power? why have you conceived this deed in your heart? you have not lied to men, but to God.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="14">And even more believers were added to the Lord, multitudes both of men and women.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">So that they brought forth the sick into the streets, and laid them on beds and mats, that at least the shadow of Peter passing by might fall upon some of them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">There also came a multitude from the cities around Jerusalem, bringing sick people, and those who were vexed with unclean spirits: and they were all healed.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="22">But when the officers arrived, and did not find them in the prison, they returned, and reported,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">We found the prison quite securely shut, and the guards standing at the doors: but when we opened them, we found no one within.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Now when the high priest and the captain of the temple and the chief priests heard these things, they were perplexed and wondered what would come of this.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Then someone came and told them, Behold, the men whom you put in prison are standing in the temple, and teaching the people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Then the captain with the officers went, and brought them without violence: for they feared the people might stone them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And when they had brought them, they set them before the council: and the high priest asked them,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="35">And he said to them, You men of Israel, take care what you intend to do about these men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">For before these days Theudas rose up, who boasted of being somebody; and a number of men, about four hundred, joined themselves to him. He was slain; and all those who followed him were scattered, and brought to nothing.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">And in those days, when the number of the disciples was increasing, there arose a murmuring among the Hellenists against the Hebrews, because their widows were neglected in the daily distribution of food.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Then the twelve called the multitude of the disciples to them, and said, It is not right that we should neglect the word of God to serve tables.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Therefore, brethren, select from among you seven men of good reputation, full of the Holy Spirit and wisdom, whom we may appoint over this business.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">But we will give ourselves continually to prayer, and to the ministry of the word.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And the saying pleased the whole multitude: and they chose Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Spirit, and Philip, and Prochorus, and Nicanor, and Timon, and Parmenas, and Nicolas, a proselyte from Antioch.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">These they set before the apostles: and when they had prayed, they laid their hands on them.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="8">And Stephen, full of faith and power, did great wonders and miraculous signs among the people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Then there arose some from what is called the synagogue of the Freedmen, including Cyrenians, Alexandrians, and some from Cilicia and Asia, and disputed with Stephen.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">But they were not able to resist the wisdom and the spirit by which he spoke.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Then they secretly instigated men, who said, We have heard him speak blasphemous words against Moses, and against God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And they stirred up the people, and the elders, and the scribes, and came upon him, and caught him, and brought him to the council,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Then the high priest said, Are these things so?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And he said, Brethren and fathers, listen; The God of glory appeared to our father Abraham, when he was in Mesopotamia, before he lived in Harran,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And said to him, Depart from your country, and from your family, and come into the land which I shall show you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Then he came out of the land of the Chaldaeans, and lived in Harran: and from there, when his father was dead, God sent him into this land, in which you now live.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And he gave him no inheritance in it, no, not even enough to set his foot on: yet he promised that he would give it to him for a possession, and to his descendants after him, even though as yet he had no child.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And God spoke to this effect, That his descendants would be strangers in a foreign land; and that they would bring them into bondage, and mistreat them for four hundred years.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And the nation to whom they shall be in bondage I will judge, said God: and after that they shall come forth, and serve me in this place.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And he gave him the covenant of circumcision: and so Abraham became the father of Isaac, and circumcised him on the eighth day; and Isaac became the father of Jacob; and Jacob became the father of the twelve patriarchs.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And the patriarchs, moved with envy, sold Joseph into Egypt: but God was with him,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And delivered him out of all his afflictions, and gave him favour and wisdom in the sight of Pharaoh, king of Egypt; who made him governor over Egypt and all his house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Now there came a famine over all the land of Egypt and Canaan, and great affliction: and our fathers could find no food.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">But when Jacob heard that there was grain in Egypt, he sent out our fathers the first time.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And at the second time Joseph made himself known to his brothers; and Joseph's family was made known to Pharaoh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Then Joseph sent for his father Jacob, and for all his family, seventy-five in all.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">So Jacob went down to Egypt, and died, he, and our fathers,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And they were carried over into Shechem, and laid in the tomb that Abraham bought for a sum of money from the sons of Emmor, the father of Shechem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">But when the time of the promise drew near, which God had sworn to Abraham, the people grew and multiplied in Egypt,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="19">He dealt treacherously with our race, and mistreated our fathers, forcing them to expose their young children, that they might not live.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">At this time Moses was born, and was exceedingly fair in God's sight, and he was cared for in his father's house for three months:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And when he was exposed, Pharaoh's daughter took him up, and raised him as her own son.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And Moses was instructed in all the wisdom of the Egyptians, and was mighty in words and in deeds.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">When he was forty years old, it came into his heart to visit his brethren, the sons of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And seeing one of them suffer wrong, he defended him, and avenged him who was oppressed, and struck the Egyptian:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">For he supposed his brethren understood that God was granting them deliverance by his hand: but they did not understand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And the next day he appeared to some as they fought, and tried to reconcile them, saying, Men, you are brethren; why do you wrong one another?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">But he who was doing his neighbour wrong thrust him away, saying, Who made you a ruler and a judge over us?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Do you want to kill me, as you did the Egyptian yesterday?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">At this remark, Moses fled, and became a stranger in the land of Midian, where he became the father of two sons.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And when forty years had passed, there appeared to him in the wilderness of mount Sinai an angel of the Lord in a flame of fire in a bush.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">When Moses saw it, he wondered at the sight: and as he drew near to behold it, the voice of the Lord came to him,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">Saying, I am the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. Then Moses trembled, and dared not look.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">Then the Lord said to him, Take the sandals off your feet: for the place where you stand is holy ground.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">I have surely seen the affliction of my people in Egypt, and I have heard their groaning, and have come down to deliver them. Now come, and I will send you to Egypt.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">This Moses whom they rejected, saying, Who made you a ruler and a judge? was the one God sent to be a ruler and a deliverer by the hand of the angel who appeared to him in the bush.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">He brought them out, after he had shown wonders and signs in the land of Egypt, and at the Red sea, and in the wilderness for forty years.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">This is the Moses who said to the sons of Israel, The Lord your God shall raise up for you a prophet like me from among your brethren.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">This is he who was in the congregation in the wilderness, with the angel who spoke to him on mount Sinai, and with our fathers: and he received the living oracles to give to us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">Our fathers would not obey him, but thrust him from them, and in their hearts turned back again to Egypt,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">Saying to Aaron, Make us gods to go before us: as for this Moses, who brought us out of the land of Egypt, we do not know what has become of him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">And they made a calf in those days, and offered a sacrifice to the idol, and rejoiced in the works of their own hands.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">Then God turned away and gave them up to worship the host of heaven; as it is written in the book of the prophets, Was it to me you offered slain beasts and sacrifices forty years in the wilderness, O house of Israel?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">You took up the tabernacle of Moloch, and the star of your god Rephan, figures which you made to worship: therefore I will carry you away beyond Babylon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">Our fathers had the tabernacle of witness in the wilderness, made according to the pattern appointed by the one who spoke to Moses.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">Our fathers then brought it in with Joshua when they took possession of the land of the Gentiles, whom God drove out before our fathers. And so it remained there until the days of David;</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="47">But it was Solomon who built him a house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">Yet the most High does not dwell in temples made with hands; as the prophet says,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="50">Has not my hand made all these things?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="51">You stiffnecked people, uncircumcised in heart and ears, you always resist the Holy Spirit: as your fathers did, so you do.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="52">Which of the prophets did your fathers not persecute? and they killed those who told beforehand of the coming of the Righteous One; whom you have now betrayed and murdered:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="53">You who have received the law as delivered by angels, and have not kept it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="54">When they heard these things, they were cut to the heart, and they gnashed their teeth at him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="55">But he, being full of the Holy Spirit, looked up steadfastly into heaven, and saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing on the right hand of God,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="56">And said, Behold, I see the heavens opened, and the Son of man standing on the right hand of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="57">Then they cried out with a loud voice, and stopped their ears, and ran upon him with one accord,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="58">And cast him out of the city, and stoned him: and the witnesses laid down their clothes at a young man's feet, whose name was Saul.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="59">And as they stoned Stephen he called upon God, saying, Lord Jesus, receive my spirit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="60">And he knelt down, and cried with a loud voice, Lord, do not hold this sin against them. And when he had said this, he fell asleep.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="8">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And Saul was consenting to his death. And on that day a great persecution began against the church in Jerusalem; and they were all scattered abroad throughout the regions of Judaea and Samaria, except the apostles.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">As for Saul, he ravaged the church, entering into every house, and dragging off men and women and committing them to prison.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Therefore, those who were scattered abroad went about preaching the word.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Then Philip went down to the city of Samaria, and preached Christ to them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And the people with one accord gave heed to the things of which Philip spoke, hearing and seeing the miraculous signs which he did.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">For unclean spirits, crying out with loud voices, came out of many who were possessed: and many taken with paralysis, and those who were lame, were healed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And there was great joy in that city.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">But there was a certain man, named Simon, who formerly practiced sorcery in the city, and amazed the people of Samaria, claiming that he was someone great:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And they all gave heed to him, from the least to the greatest, saying, This man is the great power of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And they gave heed to him, because for so long he had amazed them with sorceries.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">But when they believed Philip as he preached about the good news of the kingdom of God, and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Even Simon himself believed: and when he was baptized, he continued with Philip, and was amazed, beholding the miracles and signs which were done.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Now when the apostles who were at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent to them Peter and John:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Who, when they had come down, prayed for them, that they might receive the Holy Spirit:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">(For as yet he had fallen upon none of them: they had simply been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Then they laid their hands on them, and they received the Holy Spirit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And when Simon saw that through laying on of the apostles' hands the Holy Spirit was given, he offered them money,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Saying, Give me also this power, that on whomever I lay hands, he may receive the Holy Spirit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">But Peter said to him, Your silver perish with you, because you thought that the gift of God may be purchased with money.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">You have no part or portion in this matter: for your heart is not right in the sight of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Therefore, repent of this wickedness, and pray to God, that perhaps the intent of your heart may be forgiven you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">For I perceive that you are full of bitterness, and in the bondage of iniquity.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Then Simon answered, Pray to the Lord for me, that none of these things which you have spoken may come upon me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And when they had testified and preached the word of the Lord, they returned to Jerusalem, and preached the gospel in many villages of the Samaritans.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And the angel of the Lord spoke to Philip, saying, Arise, and go toward the south to the road that goes down from Jerusalem to Gaza. This is a desert road.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And he arose and went: and, behold, a man of Ethiopia, a eunuch of great authority under Candace, queen of the Ethiopians, who had charge of all her treasure, and had come to Jerusalem to worship,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="29">Then the Spirit said to Philip, Go near, and join this chariot.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And Philip ran to him, and heard him reading the prophet Isaiah, and said, Do you understand what you are reading?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">And he said, How can I, unless some man should guide me? And he invited Philip to come up and sit with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">Now the passage of scripture which he read was this, He was led as a sheep to the slaughter; and like a lamb silent before his shearer, so he did not open his mouth:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">In his humiliation justice was taken from him: and who shall describe his generation? for his life was taken from the earth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">And the eunuch answered Philip, I pray you, of whom does the prophet speak? of himself, or of some other man?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">Then Philip opened his mouth, and beginning at the same scripture, preached Jesus to him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">And as they went on their way, they came to some water: and the eunuch said, See, here is water; what prevents me from being baptized?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">[And Philip said, If you believe with all your heart, you may. And he answered, I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God.]</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">And he commanded the chariot to stand still: and they both went down into the water, Philip and the eunuch; and he baptized him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">And when they had come up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord caught Philip away, and the eunuch saw him no more: but he went on his way rejoicing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">But Philip found himself at Azotus: and passing through he preached in all the cities, until he came to Caesarea.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="9">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And Saul, still breathing out threats and slaughter against the disciples of the Lord, went to the high priest,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And asked him for letters to the synagogues in Damascus, so that if he found any belonging to the way, whether they were men or women, he might bring them bound to Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And as he traveled, he came near Damascus: and suddenly there flashed around him a light from heaven:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And he fell to the earth, and heard a voice saying to him, Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And he said, Who are you, Lord? And he said, I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Arise, and go into the city, and you shall be told what you must do.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And the men who traveled with him stood speechless, hearing a voice, but seeing no one.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And Saul arose from the earth; and when his eyes were opened, he saw nothing: so they led him by the hand, and brought him into Damascus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And he was three days without sight, and neither ate nor drank.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And there was a certain disciple at Damascus, named Ananias; and the Lord said to him in a vision, Ananias. And he said, Behold, I am here, Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And the Lord said to him, Arise, and go into the street which is called Straight, and enquire in the house of Judas for one called Saul, of Tarsus: for, behold, he is praying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And has seen in a vision a man named Ananias coming in, and putting his hands on him, that he might regain his sight.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Then Ananias answered, Lord, I have heard from many about this man, how much evil he has done to your saints at Jerusalem:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And he is here and has authority from the chief priests to bind all who call upon your name.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">But the Lord said to him, Go: for he is a chosen instrument of mine, to bear my name before the Gentiles, and kings, and the sons of Israel:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">I will show him how much he must suffer for my name's sake.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And Ananias went his way, and entered the house; and putting his hands on him said, Brother Saul, the Lord Jesus, who appeared to you on the road as you came, has sent me, that you might regain your sight, and be filled with the Holy Spirit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And immediately there fell from his eyes something like scales: and he received his sight, and arose, and was baptized.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And when he had received food, he was strengthened. Then Saul was for some days with the disciples who were at Damascus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And immediately he preached Christ in the synagogues, saying that he is the Son of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">But all who heard him were amazed, and said; Is this not the one who destroyed those who called on this name in Jerusalem, and did he not come here that he might bring them bound to the chief priests?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">But Saul increased all the more in strength, and confounded the Jews who lived at Damascus, by proving that Jesus is the Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And after many days were past, the Jews plotted to kill him:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">But their plot was made known to Saul. They watched the gates day and night to kill him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Then the disciples took him by night, and let him down in a basket through an opening in the wall.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And when Saul had come to Jerusalem, he tried to join himself to the disciples: but they were all afraid of him, and did not believe that he was a disciple.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">But Barnabas took him, and brought him to the apostles, and declared to them how he had seen the Lord on the road, and that he had spoken to him, and how he had preached boldly at Damascus in the name of Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And he was with them, freely coming and going in Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And he spoke boldly in the name of the Lord Jesus, and disputed with the Hellenistic Jews: but they attempted to kill him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">When the brethren learned of this, they brought him down to Caesarea, and sent him forth to Tarsus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Then the church had rest throughout all Judaea and Galilee and Samaria, and was being built up; and walking in the fear of the Lord, and in the comfort of the Holy Spirit, it grew in numbers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">And it came to pass, as Peter passed throughout all those parts, he came down also to the saints who lived at Lydda.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">And there he found a certain man named Aeneas, who had been bedridden eight years, for he was a paralytic.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">And Peter said to him, Aeneas, Jesus Christ heals you: arise, and make your bed. And he arose immediately.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">And all who lived at Lydda and Sharon saw him, and turned to the Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">Now there was at Joppa a certain disciple named Tabitha, which translated is Dorcas: this woman was full of good works and acts of charity.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">And it came to pass in those days, that she was sick, and died; and when they had washed her, they laid her in an upper room.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">And since Lydda was near to Joppa, and the disciples had heard that Peter was there, they sent to him two men, urging him to come to them and not delay.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">Then Peter arose and went with them. When he had come, they brought him into the upper room: and all the widows stood by him weeping, and showing the coats and garments which Dorcas made, while she was with them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">But Peter put them all out, and knelt down, and prayed; and turning to the body said, Tabitha, arise. And she opened her eyes: and when she saw Peter, she sat up.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">And he gave her his hand, and lifted her up, and when he had called the saints and widows, presented her alive.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">And it became known throughout all Joppa; and many believed in the Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">And it came to pass, that he tarried many days in Joppa with one Simon, a tanner.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="10">
      <VERS vnumber="1">There was a certain man in Caesarea named Cornelius, a centurion of what was called the Italian cohort,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">A devout man, and one who feared God with all his house, and he gave many alms to the people, and prayed to God always.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">About the ninth hour of the day he saw in a vision an angel of God coming in to him, and saying to him, Cornelius.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And when he looked on him, he was afraid, and said, What is it, Lord? And he said to him, Your prayers and your alms have come up as a memorial before God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Now send men to Joppa, and bring back one Simon, whose surname is Peter:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">He lodges with Simon, a tanner, whose house is by the sea.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And when the angel who spoke to Cornelius had departed, he called two of his household servants, and a devout soldier from among those who waited upon him continually;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And when he had explained all these things to them, he sent them to Joppa.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">On the next day, as they went on their journey, and drew near to the city, Peter went up upon the housetop to pray, about the sixth hour:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And he became very hungry, and wanted to eat: but while they were making ready, he fell into a trance,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And saw heaven opened, and something descending, like a great sheet, let down by four corners to the earth:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">In it were all manner of four-footed beasts of the earth, and creeping things, and birds of the air.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And a voice came to him, Rise, Peter; kill, and eat.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">But Peter said, Not so, Lord; for I have never eaten anything that is common or unclean.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And the voice spoke to him a second time, What God has cleansed, do not call unholy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">This was done three times: and the sheet was immediately taken up again into heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Now while Peter was perplexed about the meaning of the vision which he had seen, behold, the men who were sent by Cornelius, having made enquiry for Simon's house, stood before the gate,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And called out, asking whether Simon, known as Peter, was lodging there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">While Peter thought about the vision, the Spirit said to him, Behold, three men seek you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Arise therefore, and go downstairs, and accompany them without doubting: for I have sent them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Then Peter went down to the men who had been sent to him by Cornelius; and said, Behold, I am the one you seek: what is the cause for which you have come?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And they said, Cornelius the centurion, a just man, and one who fears God, and who is well spoken of among all the nation of the Jews, was directed by a holy angel to send for you to come to his house, and to hear a message from you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Then he called them in, and gave them lodging. And on the next day Peter went away with them, and certain brethren from Joppa accompanied him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And the day after they entered Caesarea. Cornelius was waiting for them, and had called together his kinsmen and near friends.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And as Peter was coming in, Cornelius met him, and fell down at his feet, and worshipped him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">But Peter raised him up, saying, Stand up; I am also a man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And as he talked with him, he went in, and found many who had come together.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And he said to them, You know that it is an unlawful thing for a man who is a Jew to keep company, or visit one from another nation; but God has shown me that I should not call any man common or unclean.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Therefore, I came to you without objection, as soon as I was sent for: therefore I ask for what intent you have sent for me?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And Cornelius said, Four days ago about this hour, I was keeping the ninth hour of prayer in my house, and, behold, a man stood before me in bright clothing,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">And said, Cornelius, your prayer has been heard, and your alms are remembered by God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">Therefore send to Joppa, and ask for Simon, who is called Peter; he is lodging in the house of one Simon, a tanner, by the sea.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">Therefore I immediately sent to you; and you have been kind enough to come. Now then, we are all present here before God, to hear all things that you have been commanded by the Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Then Peter opened his mouth, and said, Truly I perceive that God shows no partiality:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">But in every nation the man who fears him, and works righteousness, is accepted by him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">The word which God sent to the sons of Israel, preaching peace through Jesus Christ: (he is Lord of all:)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">You know that word, which was proclaimed throughout all Judaea, beginning in Galilee, after the baptism which John preached;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">How God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and with power: how he went about doing good, and healing all who were oppressed by the devil; for God was with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">And we are witnesses of all things which he did both in the land of the Jews, and in Jerusalem. And they killed him by hanging him on a tree:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">But God raised him up on the third day, and showed him openly;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">Not to all the people, but to witnesses chosen beforehand by God, that is, to us, who ate and drank with him after he rose from the dead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">And he commanded us to preach to the people, and to testify that it is he who was ordained by God to be the Judge of the living and dead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">To him all the prophets bear witness that through his name whoever believes in him shall receive forgiveness of sins.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">While Peter was still speaking these words, the Holy Spirit fell upon all those who heard the word.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">And those of the circumcision who believed, as many as came with Peter, were astonished because the gift of the Holy Spirit was also poured out upon the Gentiles.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">For they heard them speaking with tongues, and magnifying God. Then Peter said,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">Can anyone forbid water for these to be baptized, who have received the Holy Spirit just as we have?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">And he commanded them to be baptized in the name of the Lord. Then they asked him to remain for a few days.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="11">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now the apostles and brethren who were in Judaea heard that the Gentiles had also received the word of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And when Peter had come up to Jerusalem, those who were of the circumcision party criticized him,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Saying, You went into the house of uncircumcised men, and ate with them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">But Peter related the matter from the beginning, and explained it to them in order, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">I was in the city of Joppa praying: and in a trance I saw a vision, A certain object descended, like a great sheet, let down from heaven by four corners; and it came down to me:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">When I had fastened my eyes upon it and considered it, I saw four-footed beasts of the earth, and wild beasts, and creeping things, and birds of the air.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And I heard a voice saying to me, Arise, Peter; kill and eat.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">But I said, Not so, Lord: for nothing common or unclean has at any time entered into my mouth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">But the voice answered me again from heaven, What God has cleansed, do not call unholy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And this happened three times: and then all was drawn up again into heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And, behold, immediately three men arrived at the house where I was, sent from Caesarea to me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And the Spirit told me to go with them, without doubting. And these six brethren accompanied me, and we entered the man's house:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And he told us how he had seen an angel in his house, who stood and said to him, Send men to Joppa, and call for Simon, who is called Peter;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Who shall give you a message, by which you and all your household shall be saved.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And as I began to speak, the Holy Spirit fell upon them, just as upon us in the beginning.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Then I remembered the word of the Lord, that he said, John baptized with water; but you shall be baptized with the Holy Spirit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Therefore, if God gave them the same gift he gave to us when we believed in the Lord Jesus Christ; who was I, that I could withstand God?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">When they heard these things, they held their peace, and glorified God, saying, Then God has also granted to the Gentiles the repentance that leads to life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Now those who were scattered abroad by the persecution that arose over Stephen travelled as far as Phoenicia, and Cyprus, and Antioch, preaching the word to no one but the Jews.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">But some of them were men from Cyprus and Cyrene, who, when they had come to Antioch, spoke to the Greeks also, preaching the Lord Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And the hand of the Lord was with them: and a great number believed, and turned to the Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Then news of these things came to the ears of the church which was in Jerusalem: and they sent forth Barnabas to Antioch.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">When he came, and had seen the grace of God, he was glad, and exhorted them all, that with resolute hearts they would cling to the Lord;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">For he was a good man, and full of the Holy Spirit and of faith: and many people were added to the Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Then Barnabas departed to Tarsus, to look for Saul:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And when he had found him, he brought him to Antioch. And it came to pass, that for a whole year they met with the church, and taught many people. And the disciples were first called Christians in Antioch.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And in these days prophets came down from Jerusalem to Antioch.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And one of them named Agabus stood up, and foretold by the Spirit that there would be a great famine throughout all the world: and this came to pass in the days of Claudius.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Then the disciples, every man according to his ability, determined to send relief to the brethren who lived in Judaea:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Which they did, sending it to the elders by the hands of Barnabas and Saul.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="12">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now about that time Herod the king stretched forth his hands to mistreat some who belonged to the church.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And he killed James the brother of John with the sword.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And because he saw it pleased the Jews, he proceeded to arrest Peter also. (This was during the days of unleavened bread.)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And when he had apprehended him, he put him in prison, and delivered him to four squads of four soldiers to keep him; intending after passover to bring him forth to the people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Therefore Peter was kept in prison: but prayer to God was made for him without ceasing by the church.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And the night before Herod would have brought him forth, Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two chains: and the keepers before the door were guarding the prison.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared, and a light shone in the prison: and he struck Peter on the side, and woke him, saying, Arise quickly. And the chains fell off his hands.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And the angel said to him, Gird yourself, and put on your sandals. And he did so. And he said to him, Wrap your garment about you, and follow me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And he went out, and followed him; but he did not know that what was being done by the angel was real; but thought he was seeing a vision.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">When they were past the first and second guards, they came to the iron gate that leads to the city; which opened for them of its own accord: and they went out, and passed on through one street; and forthwith the angel departed from him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And when Peter had come to himself, he said, Now I know for sure that the Lord has sent his angel, and has delivered me out of the hand of Herod, and from all that the Jewish people were expecting.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">When he realized this, he went to the house of Mary, the mother of John, who was also called Mark; where many were gathered together praying.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And as Peter knocked at the door of the gate, a maid named Rhoda came to answer.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And when she recognized Peter's voice, in her joy she did not open the gate, but ran in, and told that Peter stood before the gate.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And they said to her, You are mad. But she constantly affirmed that it was so. Then they said, It is his angel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">But Peter continued knocking: and when they had opened the door, and saw him, they were astonished.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">But he, beckoning to them with his hand to hold their peace, declared to them how the Lord had brought him out of the prison. And he said, Tell these things to James, and to the brethren. Then he departed, and went to another place.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Now as soon as it was day, there was no small stir among the soldiers over what had become of Peter.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And when Herod sought for him, and did not find him, he examined the guards, and commanded that they should be put to death. Then he went down from Judaea to Caesarea, and remained there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And Herod was highly displeased with the people of Tyre and Sidon: but they came with one accord to him, and, having made Blastus the king's chamberlain, their friend, they asked for peace; because their country was fed by the king's country.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And upon a set day Herod, arrayed in royal robes, sat upon his throne, and made an oration to them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And the people gave a shout, saying, It is the voice of a god, and not of a man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Immediately an angel of the Lord struck him, because he did not give God the glory: and he was eaten by worms, and died.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">But the word of God grew and spread.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And Barnabas and Saul returned from Jerusalem when they had fulfilled their ministry, bringing with them John, who was also called Mark.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="13">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now there were in the church that was at Antioch certain prophets and teachers; Barnabas, Simeon who was called Niger, Lucius of Cyrene, Manaen, who had been brought up with Herod the tetrarch, and Saul.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">As they ministered to the Lord, and fasted, the Holy Spirit said, Separate for me Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And when they had fasted and prayed, and laid their hands upon them, they sent them away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">So, being sent forth by the Holy Spirit, they departed to Seleucia; and from there they sailed to Cyprus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And when they were at Salamis, they preached the word of God in the synagogues of the Jews: and they also had John to assist them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And when they had gone through the whole island and had come to Paphos, they found a certain Jewish sorcerer, a false prophet, whose name was Bar-Jesus:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Who was with the proconsul of the country, Sergius Paulus, a prudent man; who called for Barnabas and Saul, and desired to hear the word of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">But Elymas the sorcerer (for so is his name translated) opposed them, seeking to turn the proconsul away from the faith.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Then Saul, (who is also called Paul,) filled with the Holy Spirit, set his eyes upon him,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And said, You who are full of all deceit and all villainy, you child of the devil, you enemy of all righteousness, will you not cease to pervert the right ways of the Lord?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And now, behold, the hand of the Lord is upon you, and you shall be blind, not seeing the sun for a time. And immediately there fell upon him a mist and a darkness; and he went about seeking those who would lead him by the hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Then the proconsul, when he saw what was done, believed, being astonished at the teaching of the Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Now when Paul and his company set sail from Paphos, they came to Perga in Pamphylia: and John departed from them and returned to Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">But when they departed from Perga, they came to Antioch in Pisidia, and went into the synagogue on the sabbath day, and sat down.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And after the reading of the law and the prophets the rulers of the synagogue sent to them, saying, Brethren, if you have any word of exhortation for the people, say on.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Then Paul stood up, and beckoning with his hand said, Men of Israel, and you who fear God, listen.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">The God of the people of Israel chose our fathers, and exalted the people when they lived in the land of Egypt, and with an uplifted arm he brought them out of it.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="32">And we declare to you good news, that the promise which was made to the fathers,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">God has fulfilled to us, their children, in that he has raised up Jesus again; as it is written in the second psalm, You are my Son, this day I have begotten you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">And concerning the fact that he raised him from the dead, no more to return to decay, he spoke in this way, I will give you the holy and sure blessings of David.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">Therefore, he says in another psalm, You shall not allow your Holy One to see decay.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">For David, after he had served the will of God in his generation, fell asleep, and was laid with his fathers, and saw corruption:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">But he, whom God raised again, saw no corruption.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">Therefore, let it be known to you, brethren, that through this man the forgiveness of sins is proclaimed to you:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">And by him all who believe are justified from all the things from which you could not be justified by the law of Moses.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">Beware, therefore, lest that which is spoken of in the prophets come upon you;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">Behold, you scoffers, and wonder, and perish: for I am doing a work in your days, a work which you shall by no means believe, though a man declare it to you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">And as they went out of the synagogue, the people begged that these words might be told to them the next sabbath.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">Now when the congregation had broken up, many of the Jews and devout converts followed Paul and Barnabas: who spoke to them, urging them to continue in the grace of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">And the next sabbath day almost the whole city came together to hear the word of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">But when the Jews saw the multitudes, they were filled with envy, and contradicted those things which were spoken by Paul, and reviled him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">Then Paul and Barnabas grew bold, and said, It was necessary that the word of God should have first been spoken to you: but seeing that you thrust it from you, and judge yourselves unworthy of eternal life, lo, we turn to the Gentiles.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">For so the Lord has commanded us, saying, I have set you to be a light for the Gentiles, that you should bring salvation to the ends of the earth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">And when the Gentiles heard this, they were glad, and glorified the word of the Lord: and as many as were appointed for eternal life believed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">And the word of the Lord spread throughout all the region.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">But the Jews stirred up the devout and honourable women, and the chief men of the city, and raised a persecution against Paul and Barnabas, and expelled them from their region.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="51">But they shook the dust off of their feet against them, and went to Iconium.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="52">And the disciples were filled with joy, and with the Holy Spirit.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="14">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And it came to pass in Iconium, that they went together into the synagogue of the Jews, and so spoke, that a great multitude both of the Jews and of the Greeks believed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">But the unbelieving Jews stirred up the Gentiles, and poisoned their minds against the brethren.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Therefore, for a long time they remained there, speaking boldly in the Lord, who gave testimony to the word of his grace, and granted signs and wonders to be done by their hands.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">But the multitude of the city was divided: and part held with the Jews, and part with the apostles.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And when there was an attempt made by both the Gentiles, and the Jews with their rulers, to abuse them, and to stone them,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">They learned of it, and fled to Lystra and Derbe, cities of Lycaonia, and to the surrounding region:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And there they preached the gospel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Now there sat a certain man at Lystra without strength in his feet; he was a cripple from his mother's womb, who never had walked.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">He heard Paul speak: and Paul, who steadfastly beheld him, and perceiving that he had faith to be healed,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Said with a loud voice, Stand upright on your feet. And he leaped up and walked.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And when the people saw what Paul had done, they lifted up their voices, saying in the speech of Lycaonia, The gods have come down to us in the likeness of men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And they called Barnabas, Zeus; and Paul, Hermes, because he was the chief speaker.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Then the priest of Zeus, whose temple was in front of their city, brought oxen and garlands to the gates, and would have offered a sacrifice with the people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">When the apostles, Barnabas and Paul, heard this, they tore their clothes, and ran in among the people, crying out,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Men, why do you these things? We also are men of the same nature as you, and we preach to you that you should turn from these vain things to the living God, who made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and all things that are in them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">In times past he allowed all nations to walk in their own ways;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Nevertheless, he did not leave himself without a witness, in that he did good, and gave you rain from heaven, and fruitful seasons, filling your hearts with food and gladness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And even with these words they scarcely restrained the people from offering sacrifice to them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And certain Jews came from Antioch and Iconium, who, having persuaded the people, stoned Paul, and dragged him out of the city, supposing he was dead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Yet, as the disciples stood around him, he rose up, and came into the city: and the next day he departed with Barnabas to Derbe.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And when they had preached the gospel to that city, and had made disciples of many, they returned again to Lystra, and to Iconium, and Antioch,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Strengthening the souls of the disciples, and exhorting them to continue in the faith, and saying that through much tribulation we must enter the kingdom of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And when they had appointed elders in every church, and had prayed with fasting, they committed them to the Lord, in whom they believed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And after they had passed throughout Pisidia, they came to Pamphylia.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And when they had preached the word in Perga, they went down to Attalia:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And from there sailed to Antioch, where they had been committed to the grace of God for the work which they had now fulfilled.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And when they had come, and had gathered the church together, they reported all that God had done with them, and how he had opened the door of faith to the Gentiles.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And they stayed a long time there with the disciples.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="15">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And certain men who came down from Judaea taught the brethren, saying, Unless you are circumcised according to the custom of Moses, you cannot be saved.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Therefore when Paul and Barnabas had no small dissension and debate with them, they determined that Paul and Barnabas, and certain others of them, should go up to Jerusalem to the apostles and elders about this question.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And being sent on their way by the church, they passed through Phoenicia and Samaria, telling of the conversion of the Gentiles: and they brought great joy to all the brethren.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And when they had come to Jerusalem, they were welcomed by the church, and by the apostles and elders, and they reported all things that God had done with them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">But some from the sect of the Pharisees who had believed, rose up, saying, It is necessary to circumcise them, and to command them to keep the law of Moses.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And the apostles and elders came together to consider this matter.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And when there had been much disputing, Peter rose up, and said to them, Brethren, you know that a good while ago God made a choice among us, that the Gentiles by my mouth should hear the word of the gospel, and believe.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And God, who knows the heart, bore them witness, giving them the Holy Spirit, even as he did to us;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And he made no distinction between us and them, purifying their hearts by faith.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Now then, why do you put God to the test by putting a yoke upon the necks of the disciples, which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">But we believe that through the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ we shall be saved, just as they will.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Then all the multitude kept silence, and listened as Barnabas and Paul declared what miraculous signs and wonders God had done among the Gentiles by them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And after they had finished, James answered, Brethren, listen to me:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Simeon has declared how God first visited the Gentiles, to take out of them a people for his name.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And with this the words of the prophets agree; as it is written,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">After this I will return, and will build again the tabernacle of David, which has fallen down; I will build again the ruins, and I will set it up:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">That the rest of men might seek after the Lord, and all the Gentiles, who are called by my name,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Says the Lord, who makes these things known from of old.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Therefore, my judgment is that we do not trouble those who have turned to God from among the Gentiles:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">But that we write to them, to abstain from the pollutions of idols, and from sexual immorality, and from things strangled, and from blood.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">For from ancient generations Moses has had in every city those who preach him, for he is read in the synagogues every sabbath day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Then it pleased the apostles and elders, with the whole church, to choose men from their own company to send to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas; so they sent Judas called Barsabbas, and Silas, leaders among the brethren:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And they sent this letter with them; The brethren, both apostles and elders, send greetings to the brethren who are of the Gentiles in Antioch and Syria and Cilicia:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Since we have heard that some, to whom we gave no such commandment, went out from us and have troubled you with their words, subverting your souls, saying, You must be circumcised, and keep the law:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">It seemed good to us, having come to one accord, to send chosen men to you with our beloved Barnabas and Paul,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Men who have risked their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Therefore we have sent Judas and Silas, who shall tell you the same things by mouth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">For it seemed good to the Holy Spirit, and to us, to lay upon you no greater burden than these necessary things;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">That you abstain from foods offered to idols, and from blood, and from things strangled, and from sexual immorality. If you keep yourselves from these, you shall do well. Farewell.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">So when they were sent away, they went down to Antioch: and when they had gathered the multitude together, they delivered the letter:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">When they had read it, the people rejoiced at the exhortation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">And Judas and Silas, being prophets themselves, exhorted the brethren with many words, and strengthened them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">And after they had remained there a time, they were let go in peace by the brethren to those who had sent them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">[But it pleased Silas to remain there.]</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">But Paul and Barnabas remained in Antioch, teaching and preaching the word of the Lord, along with many others.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">And some days later Paul said to Barnabas, Let us go again and visit our brethren in every city where we have preached the word of the Lord, and see how they are.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">And Barnabas wanted to take with them John, called Mark.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">But Paul did not think it good to take him with them, for he had deserted them in Pamphylia, and did not continue with them in the work.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">And the disagreement was so sharp between them, that they separated from each other: and so Barnabas took Mark, and sailed to Cyprus;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">And Paul chose Silas, and departed, being commended by the brethren to the grace of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">And he went through Syria and Cilicia, strengthening the churches.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="16">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Then he came to Derbe and Lystra: and, behold, a certain disciple was there, named Timothy, the son of a certain woman, who was Jewish, and believed; but his father was a Greek;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And he was well spoken of by the brethren who were in Lystra and Iconium.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Paul wanted him to go forth with him; and took and circumcised him because of the Jews who were in those parts: for they all knew that his father was a Greek.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And as they went through the cities, they delivered to them the decrees, that were ordained by the apostles and elders who were in Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And so the churches were strengthened in the faith, and increased in number daily.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Now when they had gone throughout Phrygia and the region of Galatia, having been forbidden by the Holy Spirit to preach the word in Asia,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">After they had come to Mysia, they tried to go into Bithynia: but the Spirit of Jesus did not allow them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And passing by Mysia, they came down to Troas.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And a vision appeared to Paul in the night; There stood a man of Macedonia, pleading with him, saying, Come over into Macedonia, and help us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And after he had seen the vision, we immediately endeavoured to go into Macedonia, concluding that the Lord had called us to preach the gospel to them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Therefore, setting sail from Troas, we came on a straight course to Samothrace, and the next day to Neapolis;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And from there to Philippi, which is the chief city of that part of Macedonia, and a Roman colony: and we remained in that city some days.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And on the sabbath we went out of the city to the riverside, where we expected there would be a place of prayer; and we sat down, and spoke to the women who gathered there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And a certain woman named Lydia, a seller of purple, of the city of Thyatira, who worshipped God, heard us. The Lord opened her heart, so she attended to the things which were spoken by Paul.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And when she was baptized, and her household, she begged us, saying, If you have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, come to my house, and stay there. And she persuaded us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And it came to pass, as we went to prayer, a certain slave girl possessed by a spirit of divination met us, and she brought her masters much gain by fortune-telling:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">She followed Paul and us, and cried out, These men are servants of the most high God, who proclaim to you the way of salvation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And this she did for many days. But Paul, being greatly annoyed, turned and said to the spirit, I command you in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her. And it came out that same hour.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And when her masters saw that their hope for profit was gone, they caught Paul and Silas, and dragged them into the marketplace before the rulers,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And having brought them to the magistrates, they said, These men, being Jews, are troubling our city exceedingly,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And they teach customs which are not lawful for us Romans to accept, or to observe.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And the multitude also rose up against them: and the magistrates tore the clothes off of them, and commanded that they be beaten with rods.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And when they had struck them with many blows, they cast them into prison, charging the jailer to keep them securely:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And he, having received this charge, thrust them into the inner prison, and made their feet fast in the stocks.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And at midnight Paul and Silas prayed, and sang praises to God: and the prisoners heard them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the foundations of the prison were shaken: and immediately all the doors were opened, and everyone's chains were unfastened.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And the keeper of the prison awakened out of his sleep, and seeing the prison doors open, he drew his sword, and was about to kill himself, supposing that the prisoners had fled.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">But Paul cried out with a loud voice, saying, Do yourself no harm: for we are all here.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Then he called for a light, and rushed in, and came trembling, and fell down before Paul and Silas,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And brought them out, and said, Men, what must I do to be saved?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">And they said, Believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, and you shall be saved, you and your household.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">And they spoke the word of the Lord to him, and to all who were in his house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">And he took them that same hour of the night, and washed their wounds; and was immediately baptized, he and all his household.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">And when he had brought them into his house, he set food before them, and rejoiced with all his household, because they believed in God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">And when it was day, the magistrates sent officers, saying, Let those men go.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">And the keeper of the prison told this to Paul, The magistrates have sent to let you go: now therefore depart, and go in peace.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">But Paul said to them, They have beaten us openly, uncondemned, men who are Romans, and have cast us into prison; and now do they send us away secretly? no indeed; let them come themselves and fetch us out.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">And the officers told these words to the magistrates: and they were afraid when they heard that they were Romans.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">And they came to appease them, and brought them out, and asked them to depart from the city.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">So they went out of the prison, and entered the house of Lydia: and when they had seen the brethren, they encouraged them, then departed.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="17">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now when they had passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came to Thessalonica, where there was a synagogue of the Jews:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And Paul, as his manner was, went in to them, and for three sabbath days reasoned with them from the scriptures,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Explaining and proving, that Christ needed to suffer, and to rise again from the dead; and saying, this Jesus, whom I preach to you, is the Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And some of them believed, and joined Paul and Silas; as did a great multitude of the devout Greeks, and not a few of the chief women.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">But the Jews who did not believe were moved with envy, and took certain wicked fellows of the rabble, and gathered a crowd, and set all the city in an uproar, and assaulted the house of Jason, and sought to bring them out to the people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And when they did not find them, they dragged Jason and certain brethren to the rulers of the city, crying out, These men who have turned the world upside down have come here also;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And Jason has welcomed them: and they do all that is contrary to the decrees of Caesar, saying that there is another king, Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And the people and the rulers of the city were troubled when they heard these things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And when they had taken security from Jason, and from the others, they let them go.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And the brethren immediately sent Paul and Silas away by night to Beroea. When they arrived they went into the synagogue of the Jews.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">These were more noble than those in Thessalonica, for they received the word with all readiness of mind, and searched the scriptures daily, to see whether these things were so.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Therefore, many of them believed; together with not a few prominent Greek women, and many men as well.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">But when the Jews of Thessalonica learned that the word of God was being preached by Paul at Beroea, they came there also, and stirred up the people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Then immediately the brethren sent Paul away to the sea: but Silas and Timothy remained there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And those who conducted Paul brought him to Athens: and receiving a commandment for Silas and Timothy to come to him with all speed, they departed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Now while Paul waited for them at Athens, his spirit was stirred in him, when he saw the city wholly given to idolatry.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Therefore, he reasoned in the synagogue with the Jews, and with the devout persons, and in the market daily with those who happened to be there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Then certain philosophers of the Epicureans, and of the Stoics, encountered him. And some said, What is this babbler trying to say? and others, He seems to be a proclaimer of strange gods: because he preached to them Jesus, and the resurrection.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And they took him, and brought him to the Areopagus, saying, May we know what this new doctrine is, of which you speak?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">For you bring certain strange things to our ears: therefore we want to know what these things mean.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">(For all the Athenians, and the strangers there, spent their time in nothing else, but telling, or hearing something new.)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Then Paul stood in the midst of the Areopagus, and said, Men of Athens, I perceive that in all things you are very religious.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">For as I passed by, and beheld the objects of your devotions, I found an altar with this inscription, TO THE UNKNOWN GOD. Therefore, what you worship as unknown, this I declare to you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">The God who made the world and all things in it, since he is Lord of heaven and earth, does not dwell in temples made with hands;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Neither is he served by men's hands, as though he needed anything, for he himself gives to all life, and breath, and all things;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And he has made from one all nations of men to live on all the face of the earth, and has determined their allotted times, and the boundaries of their habitation;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">That they should seek God, in the hope that they might grope for him, and find him, though he is not far from every one of us:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">For in him we live, and move, and have our being; as some of your own poets have said, For we also are his offspring.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Being then the offspring of God, we ought not to think that the Deity is like gold, or silver, or stone, formed by art and man's imagination.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Those times of ignorance God overlooked; but now he commands all men everywhere to repent:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Because he has appointed a day in which he will judge the world in righteousness, by a man whom he has ordained; and he has given assurance of this to all men by raising him from the dead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">And when they heard of the resurrection of the dead, some mocked: and others said, We will hear you again on this matter.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">So Paul departed from among them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Yet certain men joined him, and believed: among them was Dionysius the Areopagite, and a woman named Damaris, and others with them.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="18">
      <VERS vnumber="1">After these things Paul departed from Athens, and went to Corinth;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And found a certain Jew named Aquila, born in Pontus, lately come from Italy, with his wife Priscilla; (because Claudius had commanded all Jews to depart from Rome:) and came to see them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And because he was of the same craft, he stayed with them, and worked: for they were tentmakers by occupation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And he reasoned in the synagogue every sabbath, and persuaded the Jews and the Greeks.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And when Silas and Timothy had come from Macedonia, Paul devoted himself to preaching, and testified to the Jews that Jesus was the Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And when they opposed and reviled him, he shook out his clothing, and said to them, May your blood be upon your own heads; I am clean: henceforth I will go to the Gentiles.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And he departed from there, and entered a certain man's house, named Justus, one who worshipped God, whose house was next to the synagogue.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And Crispus, the chief ruler of the synagogue, believed in the Lord with all his household; and many of the Corinthians heard and believed, and were baptized.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Then the Lord spoke to Paul at night by a vision, Do not be afraid, but speak, and do not hold your peace:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">For I am with you, and no man shall attack and hurt you: for I have many people in this city.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And he stayed there a year and six months, teaching the word of God among them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And when Gallio was the proconsul of Achaia, the Jews rose up with one accord against Paul, and brought him to the judgment seat,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Saying, This fellow persuades men to worship God contrary to the law.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And when Paul was about to open his mouth, Gallio said to the Jews, If it were a matter of wrongdoing or vicious crime, O Jews, I would have reason to bear with you:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">But if it is a question of words and names, and of your own law, look to it yourselves; for I will not be a judge of such matters.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And he drove them from the judgment seat.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Then they all took Sosthenes, the chief ruler of the synagogue, and beat him before the judgment seat. And Gallio was not concerned about any of these things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And after this Paul remained there many days longer, and then took his leave of the brethren, and sailed from there to Syria, and with him were Priscilla and Aquila. He cut his hair in Cenchrea: for he had made a vow.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And he came to Ephesus, and left them there: but he entered into the synagogue, and reasoned with the Jews.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">When they asked him to remain longer with them, he did not consent;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">But bade them farewell, saying, I will return to you, if God wills. And he sailed from Ephesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And when he had landed at Caesarea, he went up and greeted the church, then went down to Antioch.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And after he had spent some time there, he departed, and went throughout the region of Galatia and on through Phrygia, strengthening all the disciples.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Now a certain Jew named Apollos, born at Alexandria, an eloquent man, and mighty in the scriptures, came to Ephesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">This man was instructed in the way of the Lord; and being fervent in spirit, he spoke and diligently taught the things concerning Jesus, though he knew only the baptism of John.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And he began to speak boldly in the synagogue: and when Aquila and Priscilla heard him, they took him aside, and explained to him the way of God more accurately.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And when he wanted to go to Achaia, the brethren wrote, exhorting the disciples to welcome him: and when he had come, he greatly helped those who through grace had believed:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">For he mightily refuted the Jews, and that publicly, showing by the scriptures that Jesus was the Christ.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="19">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And it came to pass, while Apollos was at Corinth, that Paul, having passed through the upper regions, came to Ephesus: and finding certain disciples,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">He said to them, Did you receive the Holy Spirit when you believed? And they said to him, We have not even heard that there is a Holy Spirit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And he said to them, Into what then were you baptized? And they said, Into John's baptism.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Then Paul said, John baptized with the baptism of repentance, saying to the people, that they should believe in the one who would come after him, that is, in Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">When they heard this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And when Paul had laid his hands upon them, the Holy Spirit came upon them; and they spoke with tongues, and prophesied.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And there were about twelve of them in all.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And he went into the synagogue, and spoke boldly for the space of three months, reasoning and persuading them about the kingdom of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">But when some were hardened, and did not believe, but spoke evil of the way before the multitude, he departed from them, took away the disciples, and held discussions daily in the school of Tyrannus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And this continued for two years; so that all those who lived in Asia heard the word of the Lord Jesus, both Jews and Greeks.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And God performed extraordinary miracles by the hands of Paul:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">So that handkerchiefs or aprons he had touched were brought to the sick, and diseases departed from them, and the evil spirits went out of them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Then certain of the itinerant Jewish exorcists took it upon themselves to pronounce the name of the Lord Jesus over those who had evil spirits, saying, We command you by Jesus whom Paul preaches.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">There were seven sons of Sceva, a Jewish high priest, who were doing this.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And the evil spirit answered, Jesus I know, and Paul I know; but who are you?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And the man who had the evil spirit leaped on them, subdued them and overcame them, so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And this became known to all the Jews and Greeks dwelling in Ephesus; and fear fell upon them all, and the name of the Lord Jesus was magnified.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And many who believed came, and confessed, and disclosed their deeds.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Many of those who used magic arts brought their books together, and burned them before all: and they counted the price of them, and found it to be fifty thousand pieces of silver.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">So the word of God grew and prevailed mightily.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">After these things had ended, Paul resolved in the spirit to pass through Macedonia and Achaia and go to Jerusalem, saying, After I have been there, I must also see Rome.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">So he sent to Macedonia two of those who had ministered to him, Timothy and Erastus; but he stayed in Asia for a while.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And about that time there arose no small stir about the way.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">For a certain man named Demetrius, a silversmith, who made silver shrines for Diana, brought no small gain to the craftsmen;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">These he called together, along with workmen of similar occupations, and said, Men, you know that by this craft we have our wealth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Moreover you see and hear, that not only in Ephesus, but almost throughout all Asia, this Paul has persuaded and turned away many people, saying that gods made with hands are not gods at all:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">So not only is our craft in danger of being discredited; but also the temple of the great goddess Diana may count for nothing, and her magnificence may be degraded, she whom all Asia and the world worships.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And when they heard this, they were filled with rage, and cried out, Great is Diana of the Ephesians.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And the whole city was filled with confusion: and dragging Gaius and Aristarchus, men of Macedonia and Paul's companions in travel, they rushed with one accord into the theatre.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Paul wanted to enter in among the people, but the disciples would not let him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">And certain of the chief officials of Asia, who were his friends, sent to him, asking him not to venture into the theatre.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">Some cried out one thing, and some another: for the assembly was confused; and most of them did not know why they had come together.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">And some of the multitude called upon Alexander, whom the Jews had put forward. And Alexander beckoned with his hand, and would have made a defence to the people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">But when they recognized that he was a Jew, they all cried out with one voice for about two hours, Great is Diana of the Ephesians.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">And when the town clerk had calmed the people, he said, Men of Ephesus, what man is there who does not know that the city of the Ephesians is the guardian of the great goddess Diana, and of the image which fell down from heaven?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">Seeing then that these things cannot be denied, you ought to be quiet, and to do nothing rash.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">For you have brought here these men, who are neither robbers of temples, nor blasphemers of our goddess.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">Therefore, if Demetrius, and the craftsmen who are with him, have a complaint against any man, the courts are open, and there are proconsuls: let them bring charges against one another.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">But if you require anything beyond this, it shall be settled in the regular assembly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">For we are in danger of being charged with rioting today, since there is no cause we can give to justify this disorder.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">And when he had spoken thus, he dismissed the assembly.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="20">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And after the uproar had ceased, Paul called the disciples to him, and after exhorting them, he embraced them and departed to go to Macedonia.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And when he had gone through those parts, and had given them much encouragement, he came to Greece,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And there he remained three months. And when the Jews laid in wait for him, as he was about to sail into Syria, he decided to return through Macedonia.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And he was accompanied into Asia by Sopater of Beroea, son of Pyrrhus; and the Thessalonians, Aristarchus and Secundus; and Gaius of Derbe, and Timothy; and from Asia, Tychicus and Trophimus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">These went on ahead and waited for us at Troas.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And we sailed away from Philippi after the days of unleavened bread, and came to them at Troas in five days; where we stayed seven days.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And upon the first day of the week, when the disciples came together to break bread, Paul preached to them, and because he intended to depart the next day; he continued his speech until midnight.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And there were many lights in the upper chamber, where they were gathered together.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And there sat in a window a certain young man named Eutychus, who was sinking into a deep sleep: and as Paul kept talking, he was overcome by sleep, and fell down from the third floor, and was taken up dead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And Paul went down, and bent over him, and embraced him saying, Do not trouble yourselves; for his life is in him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">When Paul came up again, and had broken bread, and eaten, he talked a long while, even until the break of day, then he departed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And they took the young man home alive, and were not a little comforted.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And we went ahead to the ship, and sailed to Assos, intending to take Paul aboard there: for so he had directed, intending himself to go by foot.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And when he met with us at Assos, we took him aboard, and came to Mitylene.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And we sailed from there, and arrived the next day opposite Chios; and the following day we crossed over to Samos; and the next day we came to Miletus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">For Paul had determined to sail past Ephesus, because he did not want to spend time in Asia: for he was making haste, so that if possible, he would be in Jerusalem on the day of Pentecost.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And from Miletus he sent to Ephesus, and called for the elders of the church.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And when they had come to him, he said to them, You yourselves know, from the first day that I came to Asia, in what manner I have lived among you at all times,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Serving the Lord with all humility of mind, and with many tears, and with trials which befell me by the plots of the Jews:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">How I kept back nothing that was profitable for you, but have taught you publicly, and from house to house,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Testifying both to the Jews, and to the Greeks, of repentance toward God, and faith in our Lord Jesus Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And now, behold, I go bound in the spirit, to Jerusalem, not knowing the things that shall befall me there:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Except that the Holy Spirit testifies to me in every city, that bonds and afflictions await me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">But I do not count my life as precious to myself, so that I might finish my course, and the ministry, which I have received from the Lord Jesus, to testify to the gospel of the grace of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And now, behold, I know that you all, among whom I have gone about preaching the kingdom of God, shall see my face no more.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Therefore, I testify to you this day, that I am innocent of the blood of all men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">For I have not hesitated to declare to you all the counsel of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Take heed for yourselves, and for all the flock, over which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers, to shepherd the church of God, which he has purchased with his own blood.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">For I know this, that after my departure savage wolves shall enter in among you, not sparing the flock.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And from among your own selves men shall arise, speaking perverse things, to draw away the disciples after them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Therefore watch, and remember, that for three years I did not cease to warn every one night and day with tears.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">And now, brethren, I commit you to God, and to the word of his grace, which is able to build you up, and to give you an inheritance among all those who are sanctified.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">I have coveted no man's silver, or gold, or apparel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">You yourselves know, that these hands have ministered to my needs, and to the needs of those who were with me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">I have shown you in all things, that by labouring in this manner you ought to support the weak, and to remember the words the Lord Jesus himself said, It is more blessed to give than to receive.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">And when he had spoken thus, he knelt down, and prayed with them all.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">And they all wept bitterly, and fell on Paul's neck, and kissed him,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">Sorrowing most of all for the words which he spoke, that they should see his face no more. And they accompanied him to the ship.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="21">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And it came to pass, that after we parted from them, and had set sail, we came by a straight course to Cos, and the following day to Rhodes, and from there to Patara:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And finding a ship sailing over to Phoenicia, we went aboard, and set forth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Now when we had sighted Cyprus, we passed it on our left, and sailed to Syria, and landed at Tyre: for there the ship was to unload its cargo.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And finding disciples, we remained there seven days: and they kept saying to Paul by the Spirit, that he should not go up to Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And when our days there had ended, we departed and went our way; and they all accompanied us on our way, with wives and children, until we were out of the city: and we knelt down on the shore, and prayed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Then when we had taken leave of one another, we got on the ship; and they returned home again.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And when we had finished our voyage from Tyre, we came to Ptolemais, and greeted the brethren, and stayed with them one day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">The next day we departed, and went to Caesarea: and we entered the house of Philip the evangelist, who was one of the seven; and stayed with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And he had four unmarried daughters who prophesied.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And while we remained there some days, there came down from Judaea a certain prophet, named Agabus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">When he had come to us, he took Paul's belt, and bound his own hands and feet, and said, Thus says the Holy Spirit, So shall the Jews at Jerusalem bind the man who owns this belt, and shall deliver him into the hands of the Gentiles.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">When we heard these things, both we, and the people of that place, begged him not to go up to Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Then Paul answered, What do you mean by weeping and breaking my heart? for I am ready not only to be bound, but also to die in Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And when he would not be persuaded, we ceased, saying, The will of the Lord be done.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And after those days we packed our baggage, and went up to Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">There also went with us certain of the disciples of Caesarea, who brought us to the house of Mnason of Cyprus, an early disciple, with whom we should lodge.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And when we had come to Jerusalem, the brethren received us gladly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">The following day Paul went in with us to James; and all the elders were present.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And when he had greeted them, he declared in detail the things God had done among the Gentiles through his ministry.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And when they heard it, they glorified the Lord, and said to him, You see, brother, how many thousands of Jews there are who believe; and they are all zealous for the law:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And they have been informed about you, that you teach all the Jews who are among the Gentiles to forsake Moses, saying that they ought not to circumcise their children, nor to walk after our customs.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">What then is to be done? for they will surely hear that you have come.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Therefore, do this that we tell you: We have four men who have taken a vow;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Them take, and purify yourself with them, and pay their expenses, that they may shave their heads: thus all will know that those things, of which they were informed concerning you, are nothing; but that you yourself also walk in obedience to the law.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">As for the Gentiles who believe, we have written with our decision that they should keep themselves from things offered to idols, and from blood, and from what is strangled, and from sexual immorality.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Then Paul took the men, and the next day purified himself with them, then entered the temple to give notice when the days of purification would be fulfilled and an offering should be made for each one of them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And when the seven days had almost ended, the Jews who were of Asia, when they saw him in the temple, stirred up all the people, and laid hands on him,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Crying out, Men of Israel, help: This is the man who teaches all men everywhere against the people, and the law, and this place: and further, he has also brought Greeks into the temple, and has polluted this holy place.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">(For they had earlier seen him in the city with Trophimus, an Ephesian, whom they supposed that Paul had brought into the temple.)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And all the city was aroused, and the people ran together: and they took Paul, and dragged him out of the temple: and immediately the doors were shut.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">And as they tried to kill him, word came to the commander of the Roman garrison, that all Jerusalem was in an uproar.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">He immediately took soldiers and centurions, and ran down to them: and when they saw the commander and the soldiers, they stopped beating Paul.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">Then the commander came near, and arrested him, and commanded him to be bound with two chains; and asked who he was, and what he had done.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Some among the multitude cried out one thing, some another: and when he could not learn the truth because of the tumult, he commanded him to be brought to the barracks.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">And when he came to the stairs, he had to be carried by the soldiers because of the violence of the people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">For the multitude of people followed, crying out, Away with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">And as Paul was to be led into the barracks, he said to the commander, May I speak to you? And he replied, Can you speak Greek?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">Are you not that Egyptian, who some time ago caused a rebellion, and led out into the wilderness four thousand men who were murderers?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">But Paul said, I am a Jew from Tarsus, a city in Cilicia, a citizen of no ordinary city: and, I beg you, allow me to speak to the people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">And when he had given him permission, Paul stood on the stairs, and beckoned with his hand to the people. And when there was a great silence, he spoke to them in the Hebrew tongue, saying,</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="22">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Brethren, and fathers, hear my defence which I make to you now.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And when they heard that he spoke in the Hebrew tongue to them, they kept silent: and he said,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">I am a Jew, born in Tarsus, a city in Cilicia, yet brought up in this city at the feet of Gamaliel, and taught according to the strict manner of the law of our fathers, and was zealous for God, as you all are this day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And I persecuted this way to the death, binding and delivering into prisons both men and women,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">As the high priest and all the council of the elders can bear witness. For I received from them letters to the brethren, and I went to Damascus to take those who were there and bring them bound to Jerusalem, to be punished.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And it came to pass, that as I made my journey, and had come near to Damascus about noon, suddenly there shone from heaven a great light around me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And I fell to the ground, and heard a voice saying to me, Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And I answered, Who are you, Lord? And he said to me, I am Jesus of Nazareth, whom you are persecuting.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And those who were with me saw the light, but they did not hear the voice of the one who spoke to me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And I said, What shall I do, Lord? And the Lord said to me, Arise, and go into Damascus; and there it shall be told to you all things which are appointed for you to do.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And since I could not see because of the glory of that light, I was led by the hand by those who were with me, and came into Damascus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And one Ananias, a devout man according to the law, having a good reputation among all the Jews who lived there,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Came to me, and stood, and said to me, Brother Saul, receive your sight. And that very hour I could see him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And he said, The God of our fathers has chosen you to know his will, and to see the Just One, and to hear the voice of his mouth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">For you shall be his witness to all men of what you have seen and heard.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And now why do you delay? arise, and be baptized, and wash away your sins, calling on his name.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And it came to pass, that when I had come again to Jerusalem, while I prayed in the temple, I fell into a trance;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And saw him saying to me, Make haste, and quickly get out of Jerusalem: for they will not receive your testimony concerning me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And I said, Lord, they know that in every synagogue I imprisoned and beat those who believed in you:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And when the blood of your martyr Stephen was shed, I was standing by, and consenting to his death, and kept the garments of those who killed him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And he said to me, Depart: for I will send you far away to the Gentiles.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And until this word they listened to him, then they lifted up their voices, and said, Away with such a fellow from the earth: for it is not fit that he should live.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And as they were crying out, and waving their garments, and throwing dust into the air,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">The commander ordered him to be brought into the barracks, and directed that he should be examined by scourging; that he might know why they cried out against him so.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And as they bound him with thongs, Paul said to the centurion who stood by, Is it lawful for you to scourge a man who is a Roman, and uncondemned?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">When the centurion heard that, he went and told the commander, saying, Take heed what you do: for this man is a Roman.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Then the commander came, and said to him, Tell me, are you a Roman? He said, Yes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And the commander answered, I obtained this citizenship with a great sum of money. And Paul said, But I was born a citizen.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Then immediately those who would have examined him departed from him; and the commander was also afraid after he learned that he was a Roman and that he had bound him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">On the next day, because he wanted to know exactly why he was accused by the Jews, he loosed him from his bonds, and commanded the chief priests and all the council to appear, and brought Paul down, and set him before them.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="23">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And Paul, earnestly looking at the council, said, Brethren, I have lived in all good conscience before God until this day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And the high priest Ananias commanded those who stood by him to strike him on the mouth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Then Paul said to him, God shall strike you, you whitewashed wall: do you sit to judge me according to the law, yet contrary to the law command me to be struck?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And those who stood by said, Do you revile God's high priest?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Then Paul said, I did not know, brethren, that he was the high priest: for it is written, You shall not speak evil of a ruler of your people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But when Paul perceived that one part were Sadducees, and the other Pharisees, he cried out in the council, Brethren, I am a Pharisee, the son of a Pharisee: it is for the hope of the resurrection of the dead that I am on trial.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And when he had said this, there arose a dissension between the Pharisees and the Sadducees: and the assembly was divided.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">For the Sadducees say that there is no resurrection, nor angels, or spirits: but the Pharisees acknowledge both.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And there arose a great cry: and the scribes that were of the Pharisees' party arose, and argued vigorously, saying, We find no evil in this man: what if a spirit or an angel has spoken to him?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And when there arose a great dissension, the commander, fearing lest Paul should be pulled in pieces by them, commanded the soldiers to go down, and to take him by force from among them, and bring him into the barracks.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And the next night the Lord stood by him, and said, Take courage: for as you have testified of me in Jerusalem, so you must also bear witness in Rome.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And when it was day, the Jews banded together, and bound themselves under a oath, saying that they would neither eat nor drink until they had killed Paul.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And there were more than forty who made this conspiracy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And they came to the chief priests and elders, and said, We have bound ourselves under a great oath, that we will eat nothing until we have slain Paul.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Now therefore, you and the council notify the commander to bring him down to you tomorrow, as though you would enquire more thoroughly concerning him: and we, before he ever comes near, are ready to kill him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And when Paul's sister's son heard of their lying in wait, he went and entered the barracks, and told Paul.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Then Paul called one of the centurions to him, and said, Take this young man to the commander: for he has a certain thing to tell him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">So he took him, and brought him to the commander, and said, Paul the prisoner called me and asked me to bring this young man to you, as he has something to say to you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Then the commander took him by the hand, and drew him aside privately, and asked, What is it that you have to tell me?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And he said, The Jews have agreed to ask you to bring Paul down tomorrow to the council, as though they would enquire of him more thoroughly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">But do not yield to them: for there lie in wait for him more than forty men, who have bound themselves with an oath, that they will neither eat nor drink until they have killed him: and now they are ready, waiting for a promise from you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">So the commander let the young man depart, and charged him, Tell no man that you have revealed these things to me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And he called two centurions, saying, Make ready two hundred soldiers, seventy horsemen, and two hundred spearmen to go to Caesarea, at the third hour of the night;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And provide mounts for Paul to ride, and bring him safely to Felix the governor.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And he wrote a letter after this manner:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Claudius Lysias to the most excellent governor Felix, greetings.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">This man was taken by the Jews, and would have been killed by them: then I came with the troops, and rescued him, having learned that he was a Roman.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And when I wanted to learn the reason they accused him, I brought him down to their council:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And I perceived that he was accused regarding questions of their law, but there was no charge against him worthy of death or imprisonment.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And when I was told that there was a plot against the man, I immediately sent him to you, and also commanded his accusers to state before you whatever they have against him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Then the soldiers, as it was commanded, took Paul, and brought him by night to Antipatris.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">On the next day they left the horsemen to go with him, and returned to the barracks.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">When they came to Caesarea, and delivered the letter to the governor, they also presented Paul before him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">And when he had read the letter, he asked what province he was from. And when he learned that he was from Cilicia;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">He said, I will hear you when your accusers have come. And he commanded him to be kept in Herod's palace.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="24">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And after five days Ananias the high priest came down with some of the elders, and with a certain lawyer named Tertullus, who informed the governor of their charges against Paul.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And when he was called, Tertullus began to accuse him, saying, Seeing that because of you we enjoy great quietness, and that very worthy reforms are done for this nation by your provision,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">We accept this always, and in all places, most noble Felix, with all thankfulness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">But, that I may not be further tedious to you, I ask that by your clemency you would hear a few words from us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">For we have found this man to be a pestilent fellow, and a agitator among all the Jews throughout the world, and a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">He has also tried to profane the temple: but we seized him, [and would have judged him according to our law.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">But Lysias the commander came upon us, and with great violence took him out of our hands,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Commanding his accusers to come to you.] By examining him yourself you will be able to learn the truth of all these things of which we accuse him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And the Jews agreed with the accusation, saying that these things were so.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Then Paul, after the governor had beckoned for him to speak, answered: Because I know that you have been for many years a judge over this nation, I cheerfully make my defence.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">As you may ascertain, it has been no more than twelve days since I went up to Jerusalem to worship.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And neither in the temple, or in the synagogues, or in the city did they find me disputing with any man, or stirring up the people:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Nor can they prove the things of which they now accuse me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">But this I confess to you, that according to the way which they call a sect, so I worship the God of my fathers, believing all things which are written in the law and the prophets,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And have hope toward God, which they themselves also have, that there shall be a resurrection of the dead, both of the just and unjust.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">So I discipline myself, to always have a clear conscience before God and men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Now, after many years, I came to bring to my nation alms and offerings.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">I was purified when they found me doing this in the temple, without a crowd or a tumult. But certain Jews from Asia were there,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Who ought to be here before you, and object, if they have anything against me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Or else let these men here say if they found any wrongdoing in me when I stood before the council,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Unless it be for this one thing, that I cried out while standing among them, For the resurrection of the dead I am on trial before you this day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And Felix, having a more accurate knowledge of the way, put them off, saying, When Lysias the commander shall come down, I will decide your case.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And he commanded a centurion to guard Paul, and to let him have some liberty, and that he should not prevent his friends from ministering to him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And after some days, when Felix came with his wife Drusilla, who was a Jewess, he sent for Paul, and heard him concerning faith in Christ Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And as he reasoned with them about righteousness, self-control, and the judgment to come, Felix was frightened, and answered, Go your way for now; when I have a convenient opportunity, I will call for you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">He also hoped that Paul would give him money: therefore he sent for him often, and conversed with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">But after two years Felix was succeeded by Porcius Festus: and Felix, wanting to do a favour for the Jews, left Paul imprisoned.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="25">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now three days after Festus had come into the province, he went up from Caesarea to Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Then the high priest and the chief men of the Jews brought to him charges against Paul, and begged him,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Asking as a favour, that he would have him brought to Jerusalem, for they were planning an ambush to kill him along the way.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">But Festus answered, that Paul was being kept at Caesarea, and that he himself would soon depart for there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Therefore, let the influential ones among you go down with me, and accuse this man, if there is any wickedness in him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And when he had remained among them more than ten days, he went down to Caesarea; and the next day, sitting on the judgment seat, commanded Paul to be brought.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And when he had come, the Jews who came down from Jerusalem stood around, and brought many and grievous complaints against Paul, which they could not prove.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Paul answered for himself, Neither against the law of the Jews, nor against the temple, nor against Caesar, have I offended in any way.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">But Festus, wanting to do the Jews a favour, answered Paul, Are you willing to go up to Jerusalem, and there be judged about these charges before me?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Then Paul said, I stand at Caesar's judgment seat, where I ought to be judged: to the Jews I have done no wrong, as you very well know.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">If I am an offender, or have committed anything worthy of death, I do not refuse to die: but if there is no truth to the things of which these men accuse me, no man may deliver me to them. I appeal to Caesar.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Then Festus, when he had conferred with the council, answered, You have appealed to Caesar; to Caesar you shall go.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And after some days king Agrippa and Bernice came to Caesarea to greet Festus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And when they had been there many days, Festus declared Paul's case to the king, saying, There is a certain man left a prisoner by Felix:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">About whom, when I was in Jerusalem, the chief priests and the elders of the Jews informed me, asking for a judgment against him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">I answered them, It is not the manner of the Romans to deliver any man to die, before he who is accused meets the accusers face to face, and has the opportunity to defend himself concerning the crime laid against him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Therefore, when they had come here, I made no delay, but on the next day sat on the judgment seat, and commanded the man to be brought forth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">When the accusers stood up, they brought no accusation of such things as I supposed:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">But had certain disagreements with him about their own superstition, and about one Jesus, who was dead, but whom Paul claimed to be alive.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And because I was at a loss how to investigate such questions, I asked him whether he would go to Jerusalem, and be judged there about these matters.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">But when Paul appealed to be held for a decision by the emperor, I commanded him to be kept until I might send him to Caesar.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Then Agrippa said to Festus, I would like hear the man myself. Tomorrow, he said, you shall hear him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">So on the next day, Agrippa and Bernice came, with great pomp, and entered into the place of hearing, with the chief captains, and principal men of the city. At Festus' command, Paul was brought forth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And Festus said, King Agrippa, and all men who are present with us, you see this man, about whom all the multitude of the Jews have petitioned me, both in Jerusalem, and also here, crying out that he ought no longer to live.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">But when I found that he had committed nothing worthy of death, and that he has appealed to the emperor, I have determined to send him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">But I have nothing definite to write to my lord concerning him. Therefore I have brought him forth before you, and especially before you, O king Agrippa, that, after examination, I might have something to write.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">For it seems to me unreasonable to send a prisoner, and not to specify the crimes laid against him.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="26">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Then Agrippa said to Paul, You are permitted to speak for yourself. Then Paul stretched forth his hand, and made his defence:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">I consider myself fortunate, king Agrippa, because I shall make my defence this day before you regarding all the things of which I am accused by the Jews:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Especially because I know you to be an expert in all customs and controversies of the Jews: therefore I beg you to hear me patiently.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">The manner of my life from my youth, which was at first spent among my own nation and in Jerusalem, is known by all the Jews.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">They have known me for a long time, and, if they are willing to testify to it, that I lived as a Pharisee, according to the most strict sect of our religion.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And now I stand and am judged for the hope of the promise made by God to our fathers:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">The promise which our twelve tribes, earnestly serving God day and night, hope to attain. For the sake of this hope, king Agrippa, I am accused by the Jews.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Why should it be thought incredible to any of you, that God should raise the dead?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">I truly thought to myself, that I ought to do many things to oppose to the name of Jesus of Nazareth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And this I did in Jerusalem: and I had many of the saints shut up in prison, by authority of the chief priests; and when they were put to death, I cast my vote against them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And I punished them often in every synagogue, and tried to force them to blaspheme; and being furiously enraged against them, I persecuted them even in foreign cities.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Thus engaged, I journeyed to Damascus with authority and commission from the chief priests.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">At midday, O king, I saw on the way a light from heaven, brighter than the sun, shining around me and those who traveled with me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And when we had all fallen to the earth, I heard a voice speaking to me, saying in the Hebrew tongue, Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me? it is hard for you to kick against the goads.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And I said, Who are you, Lord? And he said, I am Jesus whom you are persecuting.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">But rise, and stand on your feet: for I have appeared to you for this purpose, to make you a minister and a witness both of these things which you have seen, and of those things in which I will appear to you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">I will deliver you from the people, and from the Gentiles, to whom I now send you,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">To open their eyes, and to turn them from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan to God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins, and an inheritance along with those who are sanctified by faith in me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Wherefore, O king Agrippa, I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">But declared first to those of Damascus, then at Jerusalem, and throughout all the regions of Judaea, and then to the Gentiles, that they should repent and turn to God, and perform deeds worthy of repentance.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">For these reasons the Jews caught me in the temple, and tried to kill me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Having obtained help from God, I continue to this day, witnessing both to small and great, saying nothing other than what the prophets and Moses said would come to pass:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">That Christ would suffer, and that he would be the first to rise from the dead, and would proclaim light to the people, and to the Gentiles.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And as he spoke thus in his defence, Festus said with a loud voice, Paul, you are raving; your great learning is making you mad.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">But he said, I am not mad, most noble Festus; but speak forth words of truth and soberness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">For the king knows of these things, and before him I speak freely: for I am persuaded that none of these things are hidden from him; for this was not done in a corner.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">King Agrippa, do you believe the prophets? I know that you believe.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Then Agrippa said to Paul, In such a short time do you think you can persuade me to become a Christian?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And Paul said, I would to God, that in a short or long time, not only you, but also all who hear me this day, might be as I am, except for these chains.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">The king rose up, and the governor, and Bernice, and those who sat with them:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">And when they had withdrawn, they talked among themselves, saying, This man has done nothing worthy of death or imprisonment.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">Then Agrippa said to Festus, This man might have been set at liberty, if he had not appealed to Caesar.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="27">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And when it was determined that we should sail to Italy, they delivered Paul and certain other prisoners to one named Julius, a centurion of the Augustan cohort.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And boarding a ship of Adramyttium, we put out to sea, meaning to sail to ports on the coast of Asia; and Aristarchus, a Macedonian from Thessalonica, was with us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">The next day we put in at Sidon; and Julius treated Paul kindly, and gave him liberty to go to his friends, that they might care for him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And when we had put out to sea from there, we sailed under the lee of Cyprus, because the winds were contrary.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And when we had sailed over the sea by the coast of Cilicia and Pamphylia, we came to Myra in Lycia.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And there the centurion found a ship of Alexandria sailing to Italy; and he put us aboard.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And when we had sailed slowly for many days, and with difficulty had arrived off Cnidus, the wind would not allow us to go on, so we sailed under the lee of Crete, off Salmone;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And, with difficulty passing it, came to a place which is called The fair havens; near the city of Lasea.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Much time had been spent, and the sailing was now dangerous, because the fast was already past, so Paul admonished them,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And said to them, Sirs, I perceive that this voyage will be disastrous, with much damage, not only to the cargo and ship, but also to our lives.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">But the centurion believed the pilot and the owner of the ship, more than those things which were spoken by Paul.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And because the haven was not suitable to winter in, the majority advised to put out to sea from there, in hopes of reaching Phoenix, a harbour of Crete, which faces toward the southwest and northwest, and wintering there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And when the south wind blew softly, supposing that they had obtained their purpose, they weighed anchor, and sailed close along the shore of Crete.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">But not long after there arose a tempestuous wind, called the northeaster.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And when the ship was caught, and could not make headway into the wind, we let her be driven along.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And running under the lee of a small island called Cauda, we had much work to secure the ship's boat.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">When they had taken it up, they used ropes to undergird the ship; and, fearing lest they should run into the sandbars of Syrtis, let down the sea anchor, and so were driven along.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">As we were exceedingly tossed by the tempest, the next day they threw the cargo overboard;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And the third day they cast out the ship's tackle with their own hands.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And when neither sun nor stars appeared in many days, and no small tempest lay upon us, all hope that we should be saved was abandoned.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Then as they had been long without food, Paul stood forth in the midst of them, and said, Men, you should have listened to me, and not have set sail from Crete, and incurred this damage and loss.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">But now I encourage you to be of good cheer; for there shall be no loss of life among you, but only the ship will be lost.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">For this night there stood before me an angel of God, whose I am, and whom I serve,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Saying, Do not fear, Paul; you must be brought before Caesar: and, lo, God has given you all those who sail with you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Therefore, men, be of good cheer: for I believe God, that it shall be exactly as I was told.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Yet we must be cast upon a certain island.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">But when the fourteenth night had come, as we were driven about on the Sea of Adria, about midnight the sailors sensed that they were approaching land;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And took soundings, and found the water was twenty fathoms: and when they had gone a little further, they sounded again, and found it was fifteen fathoms.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Then fearing lest we should run upon the rocks, they cast four anchors out of the stern, and wished for the day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">As the sailors were about to flee the ship, and had let down the ship's boat into the sea, pretending they would cast out anchors from the bow,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Paul said to the centurion and to the soldiers, Unless these men stay in the ship, you cannot be saved.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">Then the soldiers cut off the ropes to the boat, and let her fall away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">And when day was coming on, Paul begged them all to take food, saying, Today is the fourteenth day that you have continued in suspense and in fasting, having taken nothing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Therefore I urge you to take food; this is for your strength. Not a hair shall perish from the head of any of you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">And when he had spoken thus, he took bread, and gave thanks to God in the presence of them all: and when he had broken it, he began to eat.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">Then they were all of good cheer, and they also took some food.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">In all, there were two hundred and seventy-six of us in the ship.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">And when they had eaten enough, they lightened the ship by casting the wheat into the sea.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">And when it was day, they did not recognize the land: but they saw a certain bay with a beach, onto which they intended, if it were possible, to drive the ship.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">So they cast off the anchors, and left them in the sea, and loosening the rudder ropes, they hoisted the foresail to the wind, and made for the beach.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">But striking a sandbar, they ran the ship aground; and the bow stuck fast, and remained immovable, and the stern was broken apart by the violence of the waves.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">And the soldiers planned to kill the prisoners, lest any of them should swim away, and escape.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">But the centurion, wanting to save Paul, kept them from their purpose; and commanded that those who could swim should cast themselves first into the sea, and get to land:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">Then the rest should follow, some on boards, and some on broken pieces of the ship. And so it came to pass, that they all escaped safely to land.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="28">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And when they had escaped, then we learned that the island was called Malta.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And the native people showed us unusual kindness: for they kindled a fire, and welcomed every one of us, because it had begun to rain and was cold.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And when Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks, and laid them on the fire, a viper came out because of the heat, and fastened on his hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And when the natives saw the creature hanging on his hand, they said to themselves, No doubt this man is a murderer, and though he has escaped the sea, yet justice does not allow him to live.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And he shook off the creature into the fire, and suffered no harm.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">They expected he would have swollen up, or suddenly fallen down dead: but after they watched a great while, and saw no harm come to him, they changed their minds, and said that he was a god.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">In the same vicinity were estates owned by the chief man of the island, whose name was Publius; who welcomed us, and courteously entertained us for three days.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And it came to pass, that the father of Publius lay sick, afflicted with a fever and dysentery: Paul went in to see him, and prayed, and laid his hands on him, and healed him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">When this was done, the others on the island who had diseases, came, and were healed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And they honoured us with many honours; and when we departed, they put on board everything we needed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And after three months we departed in a ship of Alexandria, which had wintered in the isle, whose figurehead was Castor and Pollux.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And landing at Syracuse, we remained there three days.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And from there we circled around and came to Rhegium: and after one day the south wind blew, and we arrived the next day at Puteoli,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Where we found brethren, and were asked to remain with them seven days: and so we went toward Rome.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And when the brethren there heard of us, they came to meet us, as far as Appii forum and The three taverns: when Paul saw them, he thanked God, and took courage.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And when we came to Rome, Paul was allowed to live by himself with a soldier who guarded him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And it came to pass, that after three days Paul called the chief men of the Jews together: and when they had come together, he said to them, Brethren, though I have done nothing against the people, or customs of our fathers, yet I was delivered as a prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">When they had examined me, they would have let me go, because there was no cause for putting me to death.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">But when the Jews spoke against it, I was forced to appeal to Caesar; not that I had any charge to bring against my own nation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Therefore, for this reason I have called for you, to see you, and to speak with you: because it is for the hope of Israel that I am bound with this chain.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="22">But we desire to hear from you what your views are: for concerning this sect, we know that it is spoken against everywhere.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And when they had appointed a day, many came to him in his lodging; to whom he explained and testified of the kingdom of God, trying to persuade them concerning Jesus, both out of the law of Moses, and out of the prophets, from morning until evening.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And some believed the things which were spoken, and some did not believe.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And when they could not agree among themselves, they departed, after Paul spoke one last statement, Well did the Holy Spirit speak by Isaiah the prophet to our fathers,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Saying, Go to this people, and say, You shall keep hearing, and shall not understand; and keep seeing, but not perceive:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">For the heart of this people has grown calloused, and with their ears they barely hear, and they have closed their eyes; lest they should see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and turn, that I should heal them.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, called to be an apostle, set apart for the gospel of God,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">Concerning his Son, who was born a descendant of David according to the flesh;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And through the Spirit of holiness was declared with power to be the Son of God by the resurrection from the dead: Jesus Christ our Lord,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">By whom we have received grace and apostleship, to bring about the obedience of faith among all the nations, for his name's sake;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And you also are among those called to belong to Jesus Christ:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">To all who are in Rome, beloved of God, called to be saints: Grace to you and peace from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for you all, because your faith is spoken of throughout the whole world.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">For God is my witness, whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel of his Son, that without ceasing I make mention of you in my prayers;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Making request, that by some means I might now at last, by the will of God, succeed in coming to you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">For I long to see you, that I may impart to you some spiritual gift, so you may be established;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">That is, that we may together be comforted, each by the other's faith, both yours and mine.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Now I would not have you be ignorant, brethren, that I often intended to come to you, (but was prevented until now,) that I might have some fruit among you also, even as among the other Gentiles.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">I am debtor both to the Greeks, and to the barbarians; both to the wise, and to the foolish.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">So, for my part, I am ready to preach the gospel to you who are in Rome also.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">For I am not ashamed of the gospel, for it is the power of God for salvation to everyone who believes; to the Jew first, and also to the Greek.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">For in it the righteousness of God is revealed from faith to faith: as it is written, The just shall live by faith.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all the ungodliness and wickedness of men who suppress the truth by unrighteousness;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Because that which may be known about God is evident to them; for God has shown it to them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">For since the creation of the world his invisible nature, his eternal power and deity, has been clearly seen, being understood by the things that have been made; so that they are without excuse:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Because, though they knew God, they did not glorify him as God, nor were they thankful; but they became futile in their speculations, and their foolish hearts were darkened.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And exchanged the glory of the immortal God for images resembling corruptible man, and birds, and four-footed beasts, and creeping things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Therefore God gave them up, through the lusts of their own hearts, to sexual impurity, to dishonour their own bodies among themselves:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Because they exchanged the truth of God for a lie, and worshipped and served the creature rather than the Creator, who is blessed forever. Amen.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">For this cause God gave them up to vile affections: for even their women exchanged natural relations for that which is against nature:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And likewise the men, leaving their natural relations with woman, burned in their lust toward one another; men with men doing that which is unseemly, and receiving in themselves the due penalty for their error.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And as they did not see fit to acknowledge God, God gave them over to a depraved mind, to do those things which are not proper.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">They were filled with all unrighteousness, wickedness, covetousness, malice; full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, malevolence; whisperers,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="31">Without understanding, untrustworthy, without natural affection, unmerciful:</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Therefore you are without excuse, O man, whoever you are, when you pass judgement: for when you pass judgement on another, you condemn yourself; for you who pass judgement do the same things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">But we are sure that the judgment of God rightly falls upon those who do such things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And do you think, O man, that when you pass judgement on those who do such things, yet do the same yourself, that you shall escape the judgment of God?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Or do you despise the riches of his kindness and forbearance and patience; not knowing that the kindness of God leads you to repentance?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">But because of your hard and unrepentant heart you are storing up for yourself wrath on the day of wrath when the righteous judgment of God shall be revealed;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Who will render to every man according to his deeds:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">To those who by patience in well doing seek for glory and honour and immortality, eternal life:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">But to those who are contentious, and do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness, indignation and wrath.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">There shall be tribulation and anguish upon every soul of man who does evil, first for the Jew, and also for the Greek;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">But glory, honour, and peace for every man who does good works, for the Jew first, and also for the Greek:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">For there is no partiality with God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">For as many as have sinned without the law shall also perish without the law: and as many as have sinned under the law shall be judged by the law;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">(For it is not the hearers of the law who are justified before God, but it is the doers of the law who shall be justified.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">For when the Gentiles, who do not have the law, do by nature the things contained in the law, these, though not having the law, are a law to themselves.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">They show the work of the law written in their hearts, their conscience also bearing witness, and their thoughts either accusing or perhaps defending them.)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">On that day God shall judge the secrets of men through Jesus Christ, as my gospel proclaims.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Behold, if you call yourself a Jew, and rely upon the law, and boast of your relationship with God,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="23">You who make your boast in the law, do you dishonour God by breaking the law?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">For as it is written, The name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles because of you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">For circumcision is truly of value, if you keep the law: but if you are a breaker of the law, your circumcision has becomes uncircumcision.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Therefore, if the uncircumcised keeps the requirements of the law, shall not his uncircumcision be counted as circumcision?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And shall not the physically uncircumcised, if he keeps the law, judge you, who, though you have the letter of the law and circumcision, are transgressors of the law?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">For he is not a Jew, who is one outwardly; neither is circumcision that which is outward in the flesh:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">But he is a Jew, who is one inwardly; and circumcision is of the heart, by the spirit, and not by the letter; and his praise is not from men, but from God.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="3">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Then what advantage has the Jew? or what profit is there in circumcision?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Much in every way: First, because the oracles of God were entrusted to them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">What if some did not believe? shall their unbelief nullify the faithfulness of God?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">God forbid: let God be true, even if every man is a liar; as it is written, That you might be justified in your words, and might overcome when you are judged.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">But if our unrighteousness demonstrates the righteousness of God, what shall we say? That God is unrighteous who takes vengeance? (I speak as a man)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">God forbid: for then how shall God judge the world?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">But if, through my lie, the truthfulness of God brings him even greater glory; why am I still condemned as a sinner?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And why not say, (as we are slanderously reported as saying, and as some affirm that we say,) Let us do evil, that good may come? Their condemnation is just.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">What then? are we better than they? No, by no means: for we have already charged that both Jews and Greeks are all under sin;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">As it is written, There is no one righteous, no, not one:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">There is no one who understands, there is no one who seeks after God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">They have all left the way, together they have become unprofitable; there is no one who does good, no, not one.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Their throats are an open grave; with their tongues they have used deceit; the poison of asps is under their lips:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Their mouth is full of cursing and bitterness:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Their feet are swift to shed blood:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Destruction and misery are in their ways:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And the way of peace have they not known:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">There is no fear of God before their eyes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Now we know that whatever the law says, it says to those who are under the law: that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may be held accountable to God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Therefore, by the works of the law no flesh shall be justified in his sight: for through the law comes the knowledge of sin.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">But now the righteousness of God apart from the law has been manifested, though it is witnessed to by the law and the prophets;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">This is the righteousness of God which is by faith in Jesus Christ for all who believe: for there is no difference:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">For all have sinned, and fall short of the glory of God;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Whom God has set forth to be an atoning sacrifice through faith in his blood. He did this to declare his righteousness, for in the forbearance of God, he passed over sins of the past;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">To declare at this present time his righteousness: that he might be just, and the justifier of the one who has faith in Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Where then is boasting? It is excluded. By what law? of works? No: but by the law of faith.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith apart from the law.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Is he the God of the Jews only? is he not also the God of the Gentiles? Yes, of the Gentiles also:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Since God is one, and he shall justify the circumcised by faith, and the uncircumcised through faith.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Do we then make the law void through faith? Not at all: rather, we establish the law.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="4">
      <VERS vnumber="1">What then shall we say that Abraham, our forefather according to the flesh, has found?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">For if Abraham was justified by works, he has something of which to boast; but not before God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">For what does the scripture say? Abraham believed God, and it was credited to him as righteousness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Now to the one who works, his reward is not counted as a gift, but as his due.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">But to the one who does not work, but believes in him who justifies the ungodly, his faith is counted as righteousness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Thus David speaks of the blessedness of the man to whom God credits righteousness apart from works:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Blessed are those whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose sins are covered.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Blessed is the man whose sin the Lord will not count against him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Is this blessedness upon the circumcised only, or upon the uncircumcised as well? for we say that faith was credited to Abraham as righteousness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">How then was it credited? when he was circumcised, or uncircumcised? It was not while circumcised, but while uncircumcised.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness which he had by faith while uncircumcised: that he might be the father of all those who believe without being circumcised; that righteousness might be credited to them as well:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And the father of the circumcised who are not merely circumcised, but who also walk in the steps of the faith that our father Abraham had while he was yet uncircumcised.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">For the promise, that he should be the heir of the world, was not given to Abraham, or to his descendants, through the law, but through the righteousness of faith.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">For if those who are of the law are heirs, then faith is made void, and the promise is made invalid:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Because the law brings wrath: but where there is no law, there is no transgression.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Therefore it is by faith, that it might be by grace; so that the promise might be certain to all his descendants; not only to those who are of the law, but also to those who are of the faith of Abraham; who is the father of us all,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">(As it is written, I have made you a father of many nations,) before him in whom he believed, even God, who gives life to the dead, and calls into being those things which are not.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Against all hope he believed, that he might become the father of many nations, according to that which was spoken, So shall your descendants be.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And he did not weaken in faith when he considered his own body, now as good as dead, for he was about a hundred years old, or the deadness of Sarah's womb:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">He did not waver through unbelief in the promise of God; but was strong in faith, giving glory to God;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And was fully persuaded that, what he had promised, he was able also to perform.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And therefore it was credited to him as righteousness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Now it was not for him alone that these words were written, It was credited to him;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">But also for us. It shall be credited to those of us who believe in him who raised Jesus our Lord from the dead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">He was delivered to death for our offences, and was raised again for our justification.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="5">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Therefore, being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">By whom we also have access by faith into this grace in which we stand, and we rejoice in the hope of the glory of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And not only this, but we also rejoice in tribulations: knowing that tribulation works perseverance;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And perseverance, character; and character, hope:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And hope does not disappoint; because the love of God has been poured into our hearts by the Holy Spirit who has been given to us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">For when we were still without strength, at the right time Christ died for the ungodly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">For one will hardly die for a righteous man: though perhaps for a good man someone would even dare to die.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">But God shows his love toward us, in that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Having been justified by his blood, how much more shall we be saved from the wrath of God through him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">For if, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, how much more, having being reconciled, shall we shall be saved by his life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And not only this, but we also rejoice in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom we have now received reconciliation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Therefore, since through one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; so death spread to all men, for all have sinned:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">For though sin was in the world before the law: sin is not taken into account when there is no law.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Nevertheless death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over those who had not sinned in the same way as Adam, who is the pattern of him who was to come.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">But the free gift is not like the offence. For if through the offence of the one many died, how much more did the grace of God, and the gift that came by the grace of the one man, Jesus Christ, overflow to many.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And the effect of the gift is not like the effect of the one who sinned, judgment following one trespass and resulting in condemnation; but the free gift came following many offences and resulted in justification.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">For if by one man's offence death reigned through that one; much more shall those who receive abundance of grace and the gift of righteousness reign in life through the one, Jesus Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Therefore, as the offence of one brought judgment upon all men, resulting in condemnation; even so by the righteousness of one came justification that brings life for all men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">For just as by one man's disobedience many were made sinners, so by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">The law entered, that offences might increase. But where sin increased, grace increased all the more:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">So that as sin has reigned in death, even so might grace reign through righteousness to bring eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="6">
      <VERS vnumber="1">What shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin, that grace may abound?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">By no means. How shall we, who are dead to sin, live in it any longer?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Do you not know, that all of us who were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Therefore, we were buried with him by baptism into death: so that as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also might walk in newness of life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">For if we have been united with him by sharing a death like his, so shall we also share a resurrection like his:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Knowing this, that our old man has been crucified with him, that the body of sin might be destroyed, that henceforth we should no longer be enslaved by sin.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">For he who has died is freed from sin.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Now if we have died with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with him:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Knowing that Christ, having been raised from the dead, will never die again: death no longer has power over him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">For in his death, he died to sin once for all: but in his life, he lives to God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">In the same way, consider yourselves also to be dead to sin, but alive to God in Christ Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Therefore, do not let sin reign in your mortal bodies, to make you obey its lusts.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Do not yield your members to sin as instruments of unrighteousness: but yield yourselves to God, as those who are alive from the dead, and your members as instruments of righteousness to God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">For sin shall not be your master: for you are not under the law, but under grace.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">What then? shall we sin, because we are not under the law, but under grace? By no means.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Do you not know that if you yield yourselves as slaves to obey someone, you are slaves of the one you obey; whether of sin, which leads to death, or of obedience, which leads to righteousness?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">But thanks be to God, that you who were once the slaves of sin, have obeyed from the heart that standard of teaching which was entrusted to you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Being then set free from sin, you became the slaves of righteousness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">I speak after the manner of men, because of the infirmity of your flesh: for as you have yielded your members as slaves to uncleanness and to ever increasing iniquity; so now yield your members as slaves to righteousness, leading to holiness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">For when you were the slaves of sin, you were free from the control of righteousness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">But what benefit did you get from those things of which you are now ashamed? for the result of those things is death.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">But now, having been set free from sin, and having become slaves of God, you gain the benefit that leads to holiness, and the result is eternal life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Christ Jesus our Lord.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="7">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Do you not know, brethren, (for I speak to those who know the law,) that the law has jurisdiction over a person only as long as he lives?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">For the woman who has a husband is bound by the law to her husband as long as he lives; but if the husband dies, she is released from the law concerning her husband.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">So then, if she marries another man while her husband lives, she shall be called an adulteress: but if her husband dies, she is free from that law; so that she is not an adulteress, though she marries another man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Likewise, my brethren, you have died to the law through the body of Christ; so that you might belong to another, to him who was raised from the dead that we might bring forth fruit for God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">For when we were in the flesh, the passions of sin, which were aroused by the law, were at work in our members to bring forth fruit for death.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But now we have been released from the law, dead to that which held us bound; so that we serve in newness of spirit, and not in the oldness of the letter.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">What shall we say then? Is the law sin? By no means. On the contrary, I would not have known sin, but by the law: for I would not have known about coveting unless the law had said, You shall not covet.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">But sin, taking opportunity through the commandment, produced in me all kinds of covetousness. For without the law sin is dead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">For I was once alive without the law: but when the commandment came, sin became alive, and I died.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And the commandment, which was intended to bring life, I found to bring death.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">For sin, taking opportunity through the commandment, deceived me, and by it killed me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Therefore the law is holy, and the commandment is holy, and just, and good.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Then did that which is good bring death to me? By no means. But sin, that it might appear to be sin, worked death in me by that which is good; that through the commandment sin might become exceedingly sinful.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">For we know that the law is spiritual: but I am carnal, sold into bondage to sin.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">I do not understand that which I do: for I do not do what I want to do; but what I hate is the very thing I do.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">But if I do that which I do not want to do, I agree that the law is good.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Now then it is no longer I who does it, but sin which dwells in me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">For I know that in myself (that is, in my flesh,) no good thing dwells: for to desire what is right is present within me; but to perform what is right, this I cannot do.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">For I do not do the good that I want: but the evil which I do not want, that is what I do.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Now if I do what I do not want, it is no longer I who do it, but sin which dwells in me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">So I find this law at work, that when I want to do good, evil is present with me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">For I delight in the law of God in my inner man:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">But I see another law in the members of my body, warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from this body of death?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Thanks be to God through Jesus Christ our Lord. So then, with my mind I myself serve the law of God; but with my flesh the law of sin.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="8">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Therefore, there is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has made me free from the law of sin and death.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God did, sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, as an offering for sin; condemning sin in the flesh:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">That the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us, who do not walk in the ways of the flesh, but in the ways of the Spirit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">For those who live according to the flesh set their minds on the things of the flesh; but those who live according to the Spirit set their minds on the things of the Spirit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Now the mind set on the flesh is death; but the mind set on the spirit is life and peace.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Because the mind set on the flesh is hostile to God: for it is not subject to the law of God, indeed it cannot be.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">So then those who are in the flesh cannot please God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">But you are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if the Spirit of God lives in you. Now if any man does not have the Spirit of Christ, he does not belong to him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And if Christ is in you, the body is dead because of sin; but the Spirit is alive because of righteousness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And if the Spirit of him who raised Jesus from the dead lives in you, he who raised Christ Jesus from the dead shall also give life to your mortal bodies by his Spirit who dwells in you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Therefore, brethren, we are debtors, but not to the flesh, to live according to the flesh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">For if you live according to the flesh, you shall die: but if through the Spirit you put to death the deeds of the body, you shall live.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">For as many as are led by the Spirit of God are the sons of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">For you have not received a spirit of bondage leading to fear; but you have received the Spirit of adoption, by which we cry out, Abba, Father.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">The Spirit himself bears witness with our spirit, that we are the children of God:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ; if indeed we suffer with him that we may also be glorified with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">For I consider that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed to us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">For the creation waits in earnest expectation for the revealing of the sons of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">For the creation was made subject to futility, not of its own will, but by the will of him who subjected it, in hope,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">That the creation itself shall also be delivered from its bondage to corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">For we know that the whole creation groans in the pains of childbirth until now.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And not only the creation, but ourselves as well, who have the first-fruits of the Spirit, even we groan within ourselves, waiting for our adoption as sons, the redemption of our bodies.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">For we are saved by this hope: but hope that is seen is not hope: for what man hopes for what he sees?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">But if we hope for what we do not see, then we wait for it with patience.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Likewise the Spirit helps us in our weakness: for we do not know how to pray as we ought: but the Spirit himself intercedes for us with groanings too deep for words.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And he who searches our hearts knows the mind of the Spirit, because he intercedes for the saints according to the will of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And we know that all things work together for good to those who love God, to those who are the called according to his purpose.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">For whom he foreknew, he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brethren.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And whom he predestined, those he also called: and whom he called, those he also justified: and whom he justified, those he also glorified.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">What then shall we say about these things? If God is for us, who can be against us?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">He who did not spare his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not also, with him, freely give us all things?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">Who shall bring any charge against God's elect? It is God who justifies.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Who is there to condemn? It is Christ who died, yes, and more than that, who was raised again, who is at the right hand of God, and who also intercedes for us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">As it is written, For your sake we are killed all the day long; we are regarded as sheep for the slaughter.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">No, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him who loved us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor things present, nor things to come, nor powers,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">Nor height, nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">I speak the truth in Christ, I am not lying, my conscience also bearing me witness in the Holy Spirit,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">That I have great heaviness and continual sorrow in my heart.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">For I could wish that I myself were accursed, cut off from Christ, for the sake of my brethren, my kinsmen according to the flesh:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">They are the Israelites; to whom belongs the adoption as sons, and the glory, and the covenants, and the giving of the law, and the temple worship, and the promises;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">To them belong the fathers, and from them, according to the flesh, came Christ, who is over all, God blessed forever. Amen.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But it is not as though the word of God has had no effect. For they are not all Israel, who are descended from Israel:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Nor are they all the children of Abraham because they are descended from him: but, Through Isaac shall your descendants be named.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">That is, It is not those who are the children of the flesh who are the children of God: but the children of the promise are counted as descendants.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">For this is the word of the promise, At this time I will come, and Sarah shall have a son.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And not only this; but also when Rebekah had conceived children by one man, our father Isaac;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">(Though they were not yet born, and had done nothing good or evil, in order that the purpose of God according to his choice might stand, not because of works, but because of him who calls;)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">It was said to her, The elder shall serve the younger.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">As it is written, Jacob I have loved, but Esau I have hated.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">What shall we say then? Is there unrighteousness with God? Not at all.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">For he says to Moses, I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">So then it does not depend on him who wills or runs, but on God who shows mercy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">For the scripture says to Pharaoh, For this very purpose I have raised you up, that I might show my power in you, and that my name might be declared throughout all the earth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Therefore, he has mercy on whom he will have mercy, and he hardens whomever he wills.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">You will say to me, Why then does he still find fault? For who can resist his will?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">But who are you, O man, to answer back to God? Shall the thing formed say to the one who formed it, Why have you made me this way?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Does not the potter have the right to make from the same lump of clay one vessel for noble use, and another for common use?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">What if God, desiring to show his wrath, and to make his power known, endured with great patience the vessels of wrath made for destruction:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">That he might make known the riches of his glory to the vessels of mercy, which he had prepared beforehand for glory,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Even us, whom he has called, not only from among the Jews, but also from among the Gentiles?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">As he says also in Hosea, I will call them my people, who were not my people; and call her beloved, who was not beloved.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And it shall come to pass, that in the place where it was said to them, You are not my people; there they shall be called the sons of the living God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Isaiah also cries out concerning Israel, Though the number of the sons of Israel be as the sand of the sea, only a remnant shall be saved:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">For the Lord will execute his sentence upon the earth with speed and finality.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And as Isaiah said beforehand, Unless the Lord of hosts had left us descendants, we would have become as Sodom, and been made like Gomorrah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">What shall we say then? That the Gentiles, who did not follow after righteousness, have attained righteousness, the righteousness which is by faith;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">But Israel, which followed after the law of righteousness, has not fulfilled that law.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">Why? Because they did not seek it by faith, but as if it were based on works. They have stumbled over the stumbling stone;</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Brethren, my heart's desire and prayer to God for them is that they might be saved.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">For I bear them witness that they have a zeal for God, but not according to knowledge.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">For being ignorant of God's righteousness, and seeking to establish their own, they have not submitted themselves to the righteousness of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">For Christ is the end of the law, so that there may be righteousness for every one who believes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Moses describes the righteousness which is of the law, The man who practices these things shall live by them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But the righteousness which is by faith speaks in this way, Do not say in your heart, Who shall ascend into heaven? (that is, to bring Christ down from above:)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Or, Who shall descend into the deep? (that is, to bring Christ up from the dead.)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">But what does it say? The word is near you, even in your mouth, and in your heart: that is, the word of faith, which we preach:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">That if you shall confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord, and shall believe in your heart that God has raised him from the dead, you shall be saved.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">For with the heart man believes and is made righteous; and with the mouth confesses and is saved.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">For the scripture says, Whoever believes in him shall not be put to shame.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">For there is no difference between the Jew and the Greek: for the same Lord is Lord over all, bestowing his riches on all who call upon him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">For whoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">But how shall they call upon him in whom they have not believed? and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard? and how shall they hear without a preacher?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And how shall they preach, unless they are sent? as it is written, How beautiful are the feet of those who bring glad tidings of good things!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">But they have not all obeyed the gospel. For Isaiah says, Lord, who has believed our report?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">So faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">But I say, Have they not heard? Yes truly, for: Their voice went into all the earth, and their words to the ends of the world.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">But I say, Did Israel not know? First Moses says, I will provoke you to jealousy by those who are not a nation, by a foolish nation I will anger you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And Isaiah is very bold, saying, I was found by those who did not seek me; I revealed myself to those who did not ask for me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">But to Israel he says, All day long I have stretched forth my hands to a disobedient and obstinate people.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="11">
      <VERS vnumber="1">I say then, Has God cast away his people? By no means. For I also am an Israelite, a descendant of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">God has not cast away his people whom he foreknew. Do you not know what the scripture says of Elijah? how he appealed to God against Israel, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Lord, they have killed your prophets, and pulled down your altars; and I alone am left, and they seek my life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">But what is the answer God gives to him? I have kept for myself seven thousand men, who have not bowed the knee to Baal.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Even so, at this present time, there is a remnant, chosen by grace.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And if by grace, then it is no longer by works: otherwise grace is no longer grace.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">What then? Israel has not obtained that which it sought; but the elect have obtained it, and the rest were blinded.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">As it is written, God has given them the spirit of stupor, eyes that should not see, and ears that should not hear; down to this day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And David says, Let their table be made a snare, and a trap, and a stumbling block, and a retribution to them:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Let their eyes be darkened, that they may not see, and bow down their backs forever.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">I say then, Have they stumbled to fall beyond recovery? By no means: but rather through their fall salvation has come to the Gentiles, to provoke them to jealousy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Now if their fall means riches for the world, and their failure riches for the Gentiles; how much more will their fullness bring?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">For I speak to you Gentiles. Inasmuch as I am the apostle to the Gentiles, I make much of my ministry:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">That I might provoke to envy my own people, and might save some of them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">For if their rejection is the reconciliation of the world, what shall their acceptance be, but life from the dead?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">For if the piece of dough offered as firstfruits is holy, then the whole lump is also holy: and if the root is holy, so are the branches.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And if some of the branches were broken off, and you, a wild olive shoot, were grafted in among them, and with them partake in the rich root of the olive tree;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Do not boast over the branches. If you boast, remember that you do not support the root, but the root supports you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">You will say, Branches were broken off, that I might be grafted in.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">That is true; because of unbelief they were broken off, and you stand only by faith. Do not be conceited, but fear:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">For if God did not spare the natural branches, he will not spare you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Therefore behold the kindness and severity of God: on those who fell, severity; but toward you, kindness, if you continue in his kindness: otherwise you shall also be cut off.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And they also, if they do not persist in unbelief, shall be grafted in: for God is able to graft them in again.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">For if you were cut off from an olive tree which is wild by nature, and contrary to nature were grafted onto a good olive tree: how much more shall these, which are the natural branches, be grafted into their own olive tree?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Brethren, I would not have you be ignorant of this mystery, lest you should be wise in your own conceits; that a hardening in part has happened to Israel, until the full number of Gentiles has come in.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And so all Israel shall be saved: as it is written, There shall come out of Zion the Deliverer, who shall banish ungodliness from Jacob:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">For this is my covenant with them, when I shall take away their sins.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Concerning the gospel, they are enemies of God, for your sakes: but concerning election, they are beloved for the sake of the fathers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">For the gifts and calling of God are never revoked.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">For as you in times past have not obeyed God, yet have now obtained mercy because of their disobedience:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Even so they have now become disobedient, that through the mercy shown you they may now also obtain mercy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">For God has consigned all men to disobedience, that he might have mercy upon all.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God! how unsearchable are his judgments, and his ways past finding out!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">For who has known the mind of the Lord? or who has been his counsellor?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">Or who has first given to him, that he might be repaid?</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="11">For it is written, As I live, says the Lord, every knee shall bow to me, and every tongue shall confess to God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">So then, every one of us shall give an account of himself to God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Therefore, let us not judge one another any more: but rather decide never to put a stumbling block or an obstacle in a brother's way.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">I know, and am persuaded in the Lord Jesus, that there is nothing unclean of itself: but to him who considers anything to be unclean, to him it is unclean.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">But if your brother is hurt because of your food, you are no longer walking in love. Do not destroy with your food him for whom Christ died.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Therefore, do not let your good be spoken of as evil:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">For the kingdom of God is not food and drink; but righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">For he who serves Christ in this way is acceptable to God, and approved by men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Therefore, let us follow after the things which make for peace, and things which edify one another.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Do not destroy the work of God for food. All things indeed are pure; but it is wrong for a man to cause another to fall by what he eats.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">It is good not to eat meat, or to drink wine, or do anything that causes your brother to stumble.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Do you have a conviction? keep it for yourself before God. Happy is he who does not condemn himself in that thing which he approves.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">But he who doubts is condemned if he eats, because his eating is not from faith: and whatever is not from faith is sin.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">We then who are strong ought to bear with the infirmities of the weak, and not to please ourselves.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Let every one of us please his neighbour for his good, to edify him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">For even Christ did not please himself; but, as it is written, The reproaches of those who reproached you fell upon me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">For whatever things were written in the past were written for our instruction, that through endurance and the encouragement of the scriptures, we might have hope.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Now may the God of endurance and encouragement grant you to live in harmony with one another, according to Christ Jesus:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">That you may with one heart and one mouth glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Therefore welcome one another, as Christ welcomed us to the glory of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Now I say that Christ became a minister to the circumcised for the truth of God, to confirm the promises made to the fathers:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And that the Gentiles might glorify God for his mercy; as it is written, For this cause I will praise you among the Gentiles, and sing to your name.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And again he says, Rejoice, you Gentiles, with his people.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="12">And again, Isaiah says, The root of Jesse shall come, and he shall rise to reign over the Gentiles; in him shall the Gentiles hope.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Now may the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, that you may abound in hope, through the power of the Holy Spirit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And I myself am also convinced about you, my brethren, that you are full of goodness, filled with all knowledge, and able also to admonish one another.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Nevertheless, brethren, I have written more boldly to you on some points, as a reminder, because of the grace given to me by God,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">That I should be a minister of Christ Jesus to the Gentiles, in the priestly service of the gospel of God, that the offering of the Gentiles might be acceptable, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Therefore, through Jesus Christ I have reason to glory in my work for God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">For I will not dare to speak of any work except what Christ has done through me, to make the Gentiles obedient, by word and deed,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Through the power of signs and wonders, by the power of the Spirit of God; so that from Jerusalem, and all the way around to Illyricum, I have fully preached the gospel of Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">So I aspired to preach the gospel, not where Christ was named, lest I should build upon another man's foundation:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">But as it is written, Those who were not told of him shall see: and those who have not heard shall understand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">This is why I have been often hindered from coming to you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">But now, having no more opportunity for work in these parts, and having a great desire these many years to come to you;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">I hope to see you on my way to Spain, and to be helped on my journey there by you, after I have enjoyed your company for a while.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">But now I go to Jerusalem to minister to the saints.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">For it has pleased those of Macedonia and Achaia to make a contribution for the poor among the saints who are at Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">It has truly pleased them to do this; and indeed they are indebted to them. For if the Gentiles have been made partakers of their spiritual things, their duty is to minister to them in material things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Therefore, when I have completed this, and have made certain they have received this fruit, I will come visit you on my way to Spain.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And I am sure that, when I come to you, I shall come in the fulness of the blessing of Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Now I urge you, brethren, for the sake of our Lord Jesus Christ, and by the love of the Spirit, that you strive together with me in your prayers to God for me;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">That I may be delivered from those who do not believe in Judaea; and that my service for Jerusalem may be accepted by the saints;</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="2">To the church of God which is at Corinth, to those who are sanctified in Christ Jesus, called to be saints, with all those in every place who call upon the name of Jesus Christ our Lord, both their Lord and ours:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Grace to you, and peace, from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">I thank my God always for you, because of the grace of God which has been given you in Jesus Christ;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">That in everything you have been enriched by him, in all speech, and in all knowledge;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">So the testimony about Christ has been confirmed in you:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Therefore you lack no spiritual gift; as you await the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Who shall also confirm you to the end, blameless in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">God is faithful, by whom you were called into fellowship with his Son Jesus Christ our Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Now I urge you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you all agree, and that there be no divisions among you; but that you be perfectly joined together in the same mind and in the same judgment.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">For it has been declared to me about you, my brethren, by Chloe's people, that there are quarrels among you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">What I mean to say is that every one of you says, I am of Paul; and I of Apollos; and I of Cephas; and I of Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Is Christ divided? was Paul crucified for you? or were you baptized in the name of Paul?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">I thank God that I baptized none of you, except Crispus and Gaius;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Lest anyone should say that you had been baptized in my name.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">(I also baptized the household of Stephanas: besides that, I do not know whether I baptized anyone else.)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">For Christ did not send me to baptize, but to preach the gospel: not with eloquent words of wisdom, lest the cross of Christ should be emptied of its power.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">For the preaching of the cross is to those who are perishing foolishness; but to those of us who are being saved it is the power of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">For it is written, I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and frustrate the cleverness of the clever.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Where is the wise man? where is the scribe? where is the debater of this age? has not God made foolish the wisdom of this world?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">For since, in the wisdom of God, the world by its wisdom did not come to know God, it pleased God through the foolishness of our preaching to save those who believe.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">For Jews require a sign, and Greeks seek after wisdom:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">But we preach Christ crucified, to the Jews a stumbling block, and to the Greeks foolishness;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">But to those who are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God, and the wisdom of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Because the foolishness of God is wiser than men; and the weakness of God is stronger than men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">For consider your calling, brethren: that not many were wise according to the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">But God has chosen the foolish things of the world to shame the wise; and God has chosen the weak things of the world to shame the things which are mighty;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And God has chosen base things of the world, and things which are despised, and things which are not, to reduce to nothing things that are:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">That no flesh should boast in his presence.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">But because of him you are in Christ Jesus, who became for us wisdom from God, and righteousness, and holiness, and redemption:</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="2">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And when I came to you, brethren, I did not come with lofty speech or wisdom as I declared to you the testimony of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">For I determined not to know anything among you, except Jesus Christ, and him crucified.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And I was with you in weakness, and in fear, and in much trembling.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And my speech and my preaching were not with persuasive words of man's wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">That your faith should not rest on the wisdom of men, but on the power of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Yet we do speak wisdom among those who are mature: yet not the wisdom of this world, nor of the rulers of this world, who are being brought to nothing:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">But we speak the wisdom of God, once secret and hidden, which God ordained for our glory before the ages:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Wisdom which none of the rulers of this world understood: for had they understood it, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">But as it is written, Eye has not seen, nor ear heard, nor has it entered the heart of man, the things which God has prepared for those who love him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">But God has revealed them to us by his Spirit: for the Spirit searches all things, even the deep things of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">For what man knows the thoughts of a man, except the spirit which is within the man? even so no one knows the thoughts of God except the Spirit of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the spirit which is from God; that we might know the things that are freely given to us by God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Of these things we speak, not in words taught by man's wisdom, but in those taught by the Spirit; comparing spiritual things with spiritual.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">But the natural man does not receive the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness to him: neither can he understand them, because they are spiritually discerned.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">He who is spiritual judges the worth of all things, yet he himself is judged by no man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">For who has known the mind of the Lord, that he may instruct him? But we have the mind of Christ.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">For you are still fleshly: for while there is among you envy, and strife, are you not fleshly, and walking as mere men?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">For while one says, I am of Paul; and another, I am of Apollos; are you not mere men?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Who then is Paul, and who is Apollos, but ministers by whom you believed, as the Lord assigned to each his task?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">I have planted, Apollos watered; but God gave the growth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">So then, neither he who plants nor he who waters is anything; but only God who gives the growth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Now he who plants and he who waters are equal: and every man shall receive his own reward according to his own labour.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">For we are labourers together with God: you are God's field, God's building.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">According to the grace of God which is given to me, as a wise master builder, I have laid the foundation, and another builds upon it. But let every man take heed how he builds upon it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">For no other foundation can man lay than that which is laid, which is Jesus Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Now if any man builds upon this foundation with gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, or straw;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Each man's work shall be made manifest: for the day shall declare it, because it shall be revealed by fire; and the fire shall test the quality of every man's work.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="15">If any man's work shall be burned, he shall suffer loss: but he himself shall be saved; but only as through fire.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Do you not know that you are God's temple, and that the Spirit of God dwells in you?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">If any man defiles God's temple, God shall destroy him; for the temple of God is holy, and you are that temple.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Let no man deceive himself. If any man among you thinks he is wise in this world, let him become a fool, that he may be wise.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For it is written, He catches the wise in their own craftiness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And again, The Lord knows the thoughts of the wise, that they are futile.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Therefore, let no one glory in men. For all things are yours;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come; all are yours;</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Let a man regard us in this manner, as servants of Christ, and stewards of the mysteries of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Moreover, it is required of stewards that they be found trustworthy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">But with me it is a very small thing if I should be judged by you, or by any human court: in fact, I do not even judge my own self.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">For I know of nothing against myself; yet I am not by this justified: but he who judges me is the Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Therefore, judge nothing before the time; before the Lord comes, who will both bring to light the things hidden in darkness, and will disclose the motives of the heart: and then every man shall have his praise from God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And these things, brethren, I have applied to myself and Apollos for your sakes; that through us you might learn not to go beyond that which is written, that none of you might become puffed up in favour of one against another.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">For who makes you superior to another? and what do you have that you did not receive? now if you did receive it, why do you boast, as if you had not received it?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Already you are full, already you are rich, you have become as kings without us: and I would that you had become kings, that we might also reign with you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">For I think that God has exhibited us apostles last of all, as if we were condemned to death: for we have become a spectacle to the world, to angels and to men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">We are fools for Christ's sake, but you are wise in Christ; we are weak, but you are strong; you are honoured, but we are despised.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Even to this present hour we both hunger and thirst, and are ill-clothed, and are buffeted, and are homeless;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And we labour, working with our own hands: when reviled, we bless; when persecuted, we endure it:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">When slandered, we answer kindly; we have been made the filth of the world, the offscouring of all things, even to this day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">I do not write these things to shame you, but as my beloved children I warn you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">For though you have ten thousand instructors in Christ, yet you do not have many fathers: for in Christ Jesus I became your father through the gospel.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="17">For this reason I have sent to you Timothy, who is my beloved son, and faithful in the Lord, who shall remind you of my ways in Christ, as I teach everywhere in every church.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Now some are puffed up, as though I were not coming to you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">But I will come to you shortly, if the Lord wills, and will find out, not the speech of those who are puffed up, but their power.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">For the kingdom of God does not consist of talk, but of power.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="10">Nor thieves, nor the covetous, nor drunkards, nor slanderers, nor swindlers, shall inherit the kingdom of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And such were some of you: but you are washed, but you are sanctified, but you are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">All things are lawful for me, but all things are not beneficial: all things are lawful for me, but I will not be brought under the power of anything.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Food is for the belly, and the belly for food: but God shall destroy both of them. The body is not for sexual immorality, but for the Lord; and the Lord for the body.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And God has raised up the Lord, and will also raise up us by his power.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Do you not know that your bodies are the members of Christ? shall I then take the members of Christ, and make them the members of a prostitute? Never.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Or do you not know that he who is joined to a prostitute becomes one body with her? for the two, he says, shall become one flesh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">But he who is joined to the Lord is one spirit with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Flee sexual immorality. Every other sin that a man commits is outside his body; but he who commits sexual immorality sins against his own body.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit, who is in you, whom you have received from God, and that you are not your own?</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Now concerning the things about which you wrote to me: It is good for a man not to touch a woman.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Nevertheless, to avoid impurity, let every man have his own wife, and let every woman have her own husband.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Let the husband fulfill his marital duty to his wife: and likewise the wife to the husband.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">The wife does not have authority over her own body, but the husband does: and likewise the husband does not have authority over his own body, but the wife does.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Do not deprive one another, except by consent for a time, that you may give yourselves to prayer; and then come together again, that Satan may not tempt you for your lack of self-control.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But I speak this as a concession, and not as a commandment.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">For I wish that all men were as I am. But every man has his proper gift from God, one of this type, and another of that.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Therefore I say to the unmarried and widows, It is good for them to remain single, as I am.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">But if they cannot contain themselves, let them marry: for it is better to marry than to burn with passion.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And to the married I give this command, not I, but the Lord, Let the wife not depart from her husband:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">But if she does depart, let her remain unmarried, or be reconciled to her husband: and let the husband not divorce his wife.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">But to the rest I say, not the Lord: If any brother has a wife who does not believe, and she is willing to live with him, let him not divorce her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And the woman who has a husband who does not believe, and if he is willing to live with her, let her not leave him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">For the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the husband: otherwise your children would be unclean; but now are they holy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">But if the unbelieving one departs, let him depart. A brother or a sister is not under bondage in such cases: for God has called us to peace.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">For how do you know, O wife, whether you shall save your husband? or how do you know, O man, whether you shall save your wife?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">But as the Lord has assigned to every man, as God has called every one, so let him walk. And this is my rule in all the churches.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Was any man circumcised when he was called? let him not become uncircumcised. Was any uncircumcised when called? let him not be circumcised.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but keeping of the commandments of God is what matters.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Let every man remain in the same situation in which he was called.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Were you called when a slave? do not let it trouble you: but if you may become free, do so.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="25">Now concerning virgins I have no commandment from the Lord: yet I give my judgment, as one who has obtained mercy from the Lord to be trustworthy.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="27">Are you bound to a wife? do not seek to be released. Are you released from a wife? do not seek a wife.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">But if you do marry, you have not sinned; and if a virgin marries, she has not sinned. Nevertheless, those who marry shall have trouble in this life: and I seek to spare you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">But this I say, brethren, the time is short: from now on let those who have wives be as though they had none;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And those who weep, as though they did not weep; and those who rejoice, as though they did not rejoice; and those who buy, as though they did not possess;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">And those who use this world, as though not engrossed in it: for the form of this world passes away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">I would have you be without concern. He who is unmarried is concerned for the things that belong to the Lord, how he may please the Lord:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">But he who is married is concerned for the things that are of the world, how he may please his wife,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">And his interests are divided. And the unmarried woman or the virgin cares for the things of the Lord, that she may be holy both in body and in spirit: but she who is married cares for the things of the world, how she may please her husband.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">And this I speak for your own benefit; not to restrain you, but to promote that which is seemly, and that you may attend to the Lord without distraction.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">But if any man thinks that he is behaving improperly toward the virgin he is engaged to, if she is passing the flower of her youth, and if need so requires, let him do what he wishes, he does not sin: let them marry.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">Nevertheless, he who stands steadfast in his heart, being under no compulsion, but having power over his own will, and having determined in his heart that he will keep his virginity, does well.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">So then he who marries does well; but he who does not marry does better.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">The wife is bound as long as her husband lives; but if her husband dies, she is at liberty to marry whom she wishes; only in the Lord.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Now regarding things offered to idols, we know that we all have knowledge. Knowledge puffs up, but love builds up.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And if any man thinks that he knows something, he does not yet know as he ought to know.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">But if any man loves God, he is known by him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Therefore, concerning the eating of those things that are offered in sacrifice to idols, we know that an idol is nothing in the world, and that there is no God but one.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">For though there are things that are called gods, in heaven and on earth, (and indeed there are many gods, and many lords,)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But for us there is but one God, the Father, from whom are all things, and we exist for him; and one Lord Jesus Christ, through whom are all things, and we exist through him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Yet, not every man has this knowledge: for some are still accustomed to idols, and eat a thing as if it were really offered to an idol; and because their conscience is weak it is defiled.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">But food does not commend us to God: if we eat, we are none the better; if we do not eat, we are none the worse.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">But take heed lest by any means this liberty of yours become a stumbling block to those who are weak.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">For if any man sees you, who have knowledge, eating in an idol's temple, shall not the conscience of the one who is weak be emboldened to eat those things which are offered to idols?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And so through your knowledge the weak brother is ruined, he for whom Christ died.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Thus, when you sin against the brethren in this way, and wound their weak conscience, you sin against Christ.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="10">Or does he say it altogether for our sakes? For our sakes it is written: that he who plows should plow in hope; and he who threshes should thresh in hope of a share of the crop.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="28">And God has appointed in the church, first apostles, second prophets, third teachers, after that workers of miracles, then those with gifts of healing, helpers, administrators, and those who speak in different tongues.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Are all apostles? are all prophets? are all teachers? are all workers of miracles?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Do all have gifts of healing? do all speak with tongues? do all interpret?</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">If I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, but have not love, I have become a noisy gong, or a clanging cymbal.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And if I have the gift of prophecy, and understand all mysteries, and all knowledge; and if I have all faith, so that I can remove mountains, but have not love, I am nothing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And if I give all my goods to feed the poor, and if I give my body to be burned, but have not love, I gain nothing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Love is patient, and is kind; love does not envy; love does not boast, and is not arrogant;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">It is not rude, does not insist on its own way, is not easily provoked, it keeps no account of wrongs suffered;</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="8">Love never fails: but where there are prophecies, they shall pass away; where there are tongues, they shall cease; where there is knowledge, it shall vanish away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">For we know in part, and we prophesy in part.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">But when that which is perfect comes, then that which is partial shall pass away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">When I was a child, I spoke as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child: but when I became a man, I put away childish things.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="13">And now abide faith, hope, love, these three; but the greatest of these is love.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="14">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Follow after love, and desire spiritual gifts, but especially that you may prophesy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">For he who speaks in an unknown tongue does not speak to men, but to God: for no man understands him; yet in the spirit he speaks mysteries.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">But he who prophesies speaks to men for their edification, and exhortation, and comfort.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">He who speaks in an unknown tongue edifies himself; but he who prophesies edifies the church.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">I would like for you all to speak in tongues, but even more that you would prophesy: for greater is he who prophesies than he who speaks with tongues, unless he interprets, so that the church may be edified.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Now, brethren, if I come to you speaking with tongues, how will I benefit you, unless I shall speak to you some revelation, or knowledge, or prophesy, or instruction?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Even lifeless things which give sound, such as the pipe or harp, unless they make a distinction in the sounds, how shall it be known what is played?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">For if the trumpet gives an uncertain sound, who shall prepare himself for the battle?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">So likewise you, unless you utter by the tongue words that are easy to understand, how shall it be known what is spoken? for you shall speak into the air.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">There are, it may be, many kinds of languages in the world, and none of them is without meaning.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">But if I do not know the meaning of the language, I shall be to him who speaks a foreigner, and he who speaks shall be a foreigner to me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">So with you, since you are zealous for spiritual gifts, seek to excel in edifying the church.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Therefore, let him who speaks in an unknown tongue pray that he may interpret.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">For if I pray in an unknown tongue, my spirit prays, but my mind is unfruitful.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">What am I to do? I will pray with the spirit, and I will pray with the mind also: I will sing with the spirit, and I will sing with the mind also.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Otherwise when you bless with the spirit, how shall he who is ungifted say Amen to your giving of thanks, seeing that he does not understand what you say?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">For you may truly give thanks well, but the other man is not edified.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">I thank my God, that I speak with tongues more than all of you:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Yet in the church I would rather speak five words with my understanding, that by my voice I might teach others also, than ten thousand words in an unknown tongue.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Brethren, do not be children in understanding: in evil be infants, but in understanding be men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">In the law it is written, By men of strange tongues and by the lips of foreigners I will speak to this people; and yet for all that they will not hear me, says the Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Therefore tongues are a sign, not for those who believe, but for those who do not believe: but prophesy is not only for those who do not believe, but also for those who do believe.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Therefore, if the whole church comes together in one place, and all speak in tongues, and those who are ungifted, or unbelievers, come in, will they not say that you are mad?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">But if all prophesy, and one comes in who does not believe, or is ungifted, he is convicted by all, he is judged by all:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">The secrets of his heart are disclosed; and so falling down on his face he will worship God, and report that God is really among you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">What then, brethren? when you come together, every one of you has a psalm, has a teaching, has a tongue, has a revelation, has an interpretation. Let all things be done for edification.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">If anyone speaks in an unknown tongue, let there be two, or at the most three, and each in turn; and let one interpret.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">But if there is no interpreter, let him keep silent in the church; and let him speak to himself, and to God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Let two or three prophets speak, and let the others judge.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">If anything is revealed to another who sits by, let the first hold his peace.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">For you may all prophesy one by one, that all may learn, and all may be encouraged.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">And the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">For God is not a God of confusion, but of peace. As in all churches of the saints,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Let the women keep silent in the churches: for it is not permitted for them to speak; but they should be subordinate, as the law says.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">And if they wish to learn anything, let them ask their husbands at home: for it is a disgrace for women to speak in the church.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">What? did the word of God come forth from you? or has it come only to you?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">If any man thinks he is a prophet, or spiritual, let him acknowledge that what I write to you is a commandment of the Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">But if any man does not recognize this, he is not recognized.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">Therefore, brethren, desire to prophesy, and do not forbid speaking in tongues.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Now, brethren, I would remind you of the gospel which I preached to you, which you have received, and in which you stand;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">By which you are also saved, if you hold fast to what I preached to you, unless you believed in vain.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">For I delivered to you as of first importance that which I received, that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And that he appeared to Cephas, then to the twelve:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">After that, he appeared to more than five hundred brethren at once; of whom the greater part are still alive, though some have fallen asleep.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">After that, he appeared to James; then to all the apostles.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And last of all he appeared to me also, as to one untimely born.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">For I am the least of the apostles, and am not worthy to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">But by the grace of God I am what I am: and his grace which was bestowed upon me was not in vain; but I laboured more abundantly than all of them: yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Therefore, whether it was I or they, this we preach, and this you believed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Now if Christ is preached, that he rose from the dead, how is it that some among you say that there is no resurrection from the dead?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">But if there is no resurrection of the dead, then Christ has not risen:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And if Christ has not risen, then our preaching is in vain, and your faith is also in vain.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Yea, and we are found to be false witnesses of God; because we have testified of God that he raised up Christ, whom he has raised not up, if it is true that the dead do not rise.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">For if the dead are not raised, then Christ has not been raised:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And if Christ has not been raised, your faith is in vain; you are still in your sins.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Then those also who have fallen asleep in Christ have perished.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">If for this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men most miserable.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">But Christ has indeed been raised from the dead, the first-fruits of those who sleep.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">For since by man came death, by man also came the resurrection of the dead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">For just as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">But every man in his own order: Christ the first-fruits; afterward those who are Christ's at his coming.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Then comes the end, when he delivers up the kingdom to God the Father; after he has destroyed all rule and all authority and power.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">For he must reign, until he has put all enemies under his feet.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">For he has put all things under his feet. But when he says all things are put under him, it is clear that he himself is excepted, who put all things under him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And when all things shall be subjected to him, then shall the Son himself be subject to him who put all things under him, that God may be all in all.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Otherwise, what shall they do who are baptized for the dead, if the dead are not raised at all? why then are they baptized for the dead?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And why do we stand in jeopardy every hour?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">I assure you, just as I rejoice in you through Christ Jesus our Lord: I die daily.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">If for merely human reasons I fought beasts in Ephesus, what advantage is that to me, if the dead are not raised? let us eat and drink; for tomorrow we die.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">Do not be deceived: bad company corrupts good morals.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Awaken to sobriety, and do not sin; for some do not have the knowledge of God: I speak this to your shame.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">But some will say, How are the dead raised up? and with what kind of body will they come?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">You fool, that which you sow does not come to life, unless it dies:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">And that which you sow is not the body that shall be, but a bare seed, perhaps of wheat, or of some other grain:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">But God gives it a body as he has determined, and to every kind of seed its own body.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">All flesh is not the same flesh: but there is one flesh of men, another flesh of beasts, another of fish, and another of birds.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">There are also celestial bodies, and terrestrial bodies: but the glory of the celestial is of one kind, and the glory of the terrestrial is of another.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">There is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars: for star differs from star in glory.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">So also is the resurrection of the dead. It is sown perishable; it is raised imperishable:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">It is sown in dishonour; it is raised in glory: it is sown in weakness; it is raised in power:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">It is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body. If there is a natural body, there is also a spiritual body.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">And so it is written, The first man, Adam, was made a living being; the last Adam, a life-giving spirit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">Yet, it is not that which is spiritual that is first, but that which is natural; and afterward that which is spiritual.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">The first man was of the earth, made of dust: the second man is from heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">As was the man of dust, so it is with those who are of dust: and as is the man of heaven, so it is with those who are of heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">And as we have borne the image of the man of dust, we shall also bear the image of the man of heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; nor does the perishable inherit the imperishable.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="51">Behold, I tell you a mystery; We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="52">In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised imperishable, and we shall be changed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="53">For the perishable must put on the imperishable, and the mortal must put on immortality.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="54">When the perishable has put on the imperishable, and the mortal has put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="55">O death, where is your sting? O grave, where is your victory?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="56">The sting of death is sin; and the power of sin is the law.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="57">But thanks be to God, who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="58">Therefore, my beloved brethren, be steadfast, immovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, knowing that your labour is not in vain in the Lord.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="2">Grace to you and peace from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies, and the God of all comfort;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Who comforts us in all our troubles, that we may be able to comfort those who are in any trouble with the comfort with which we ourselves are comforted by God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">For as we abundantly share in the sufferings of Christ, so through Christ we also abundantly share in comfort.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But if we are afflicted, it is for your comfort and salvation; and if we are comforted, it is for your comfort, which works in you when you patiently endure the same sufferings which we suffer.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And our hope for you is steadfast, knowing, that as you are partakers of our sufferings, so you also partake of our comfort.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">For we would not have you ignorant of our trouble, brethren, which came to us in Asia, that we were pressed down beyond measure, beyond our strength, so that we despaired even of life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Indeed, we had the sentence of death in ourselves, that we should not trust in ourselves, but in God who raises the dead:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Who has delivered us from so deadly a peril, and who will deliver us: we trust in him, that he will deliver us again,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="13">For we write nothing to you, except what you can read and understand; and I trust you shall understand fully;</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="15">And in this confidence I intended to come to you first, that you might benefit twice;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">I planned to visit you on my way to Macedonia, and again visit you when I returned from Macedonia, and to be helped by you on my way to Judaea.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">When I planned this, did I do it lightly? or the things that I plan, do I plan according to the flesh, that I should say yes, yes when I may mean no, no?</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="4">For I wrote to you out of much affliction and anguish of heart, with many tears; not that you should be grieved, but that you might know the abundant love which I have for you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">But if anyone has caused grief, he has not grieved me, but to some degree, not to put it too severely, to all of you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Sufficient for such a man is this punishment, which was inflicted by the majority.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">So you ought rather to forgive him, and comfort him, lest perhaps he may be overwhelmed with excessive sorrow.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Therefore I urge you, that you would reaffirm your love for him.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="10">For even that which was glorious no longer has glory, because of the glory that surpasses it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">For if that which has faded away came with glory, how much more glorious is that which remains.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Seeing then that we have such a hope, we use great boldness of speech:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Not as Moses, who put a veil over his face, so the sons of Israel could not gaze upon that which was fading.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">But their minds were hardened: for to this day the same veil remains unlifted at the reading of the old covenant; because it is only removed through Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">But even to this day, when Moses is read, the veil is upon their hearts.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">But whenever a man shall turn to the Lord, the veil shall be taken away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Now the Lord is the Spirit: and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">But we all, with unveiled faces beholding as in a mirror the glory of the Lord, are changed into that same image, from glory to glory, and this is from the Lord, the Spirit.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="4">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Therefore, since we have this ministry by God's mercy, we do not loose heart;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">But we have renounced the hidden, shameful things, and do not walk in craftiness, nor handle the word of God deceitfully; but by the manifestation of the truth we commend ourselves to every man's conscience in the sight of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">But if our gospel is veiled, it is veiled to those who are perishing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">For the god of this world has blinded the minds of those who do not believe, lest they should see the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">For we do not preach ourselves, but Christ Jesus as Lord; and ourselves as your servants for Jesus' sake.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">For God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, has shone in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the transcendent power may be shown to be from God, and not from us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">We are troubled on every side, yet not crushed; we are perplexed, but not in despair;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Persecuted, but not forsaken; struck down, but not destroyed;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Always carrying about in our body the dying of Jesus, that the life of Jesus might also be made manifest in our body.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">For we who live are always being delivered over to death for Jesus' sake, that the life of Jesus might also be made manifest in our mortal flesh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">So then death works in us, but life in you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">As it is written, I believed, and therefore I have spoken; so we, with the same spirit of faith, also believe, and therefore speak;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Knowing that he who raised up the Lord Jesus shall also raise us up with Jesus, and shall present us with you in his presence.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">For all things are for your sakes, that as grace extends to more and more people, it might cause thanksgiving to abound, to the glory of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">For this reason we do not loose heart; but though our outer man perish, yet the inner man is renewed day by day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, prepares for us an incomparable and eternal weight of glory;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">So we do not look at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen: for the things which are seen are temporal; but the things which are not seen are eternal.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="5">
      <VERS vnumber="1">For we know that if the earthly tent in which we live is destroyed, we have a building from God, a house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">For in this house we groan, earnestly desiring to be clothed with our dwelling which is from heaven:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">So that being clothed we shall not be found naked.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">For we who are in this tent groan, being burdened: not that we would be unclothed, but rather further clothed, that mortality might be swallowed up by life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Now he who has made us for this very thing is God, who has also given to us the Spirit as a pledge.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Therefore, we are always confident, knowing that while we are at home in the body, we are absent from the Lord:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">(For we walk by faith, not by sight:)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">We are confident, and would rather be absent from the body, and present with the Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Therefore we labour, that whether at home or absent, we may please him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ; that every one may receive what is due him for the things done in the body, according to what he has done, whether good or bad.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Therefore, knowing the fear of the Lord, we persuade men. But what we are is plain to God; and I also trust it is plain to your consciences.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">For we do not commend ourselves to you again, but give you occasion to be proud of us, that you may have something to answer those who take pride in appearance, and not in the heart.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">For if we are out of our minds, it is for God: or if we are in our right minds, it is for you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">For the love of Christ controls us; because we are convinced that one died for all, therefore all died:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And he died for all, that those who live should not henceforth live for themselves, but for him who died for them, and rose again.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Therefore, we no longer regard man according to the flesh: though once we regarded Christ according to the flesh, yet now we regard him thus no longer.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Therefore if any man is in Christ, he is a new creature: old things have passed away; behold, new things have come.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And all these things are from God, who has reconciled us to himself through Jesus Christ, and has given to us the ministry of reconciliation;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">That is, that God was in Christ, reconciling the world to himself, not counting men's sins against them; and he has committed to us the word of reconciliation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Now then, we are ambassadors for Christ, as if God were making his appeal through us: we beg you on Christ's behalf, be reconciled to God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">For our sakes he has made him to be sin, who knew no sin; that in him we might become the righteousness of God.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="6">
      <VERS vnumber="1">We then, as workers together with him, urge you not to receive the grace of God in vain.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="5">In beatings, in imprisonments, in tumults, in labours, in sleeplessness, in hunger;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">By purity, by knowledge, by patience, by kindness, in the Holy Spirit, in unfeigned love,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">By the word of truth, by the power of God, by the weapons of righteousness in the right hand and in the left,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">In honour and dishonour, in evil report and good report: regarded as deceivers, and yet true;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">As unknown, and yet well known; as dying, yet, behold, we live; as chastened, and yet not killed;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">As sorrowful, yet always rejoicing; as poor, yet making many rich; as having nothing, and yet possessing all things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">O Corinthians, we have spoken freely to you, our hearts are open wide.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">There is no restraint in our affection for you, but you are restrained in your affection for us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">As a fair exchange, (I speak as to children,) widen your hearts also.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Do not be unequally yoked with unbelievers: for what partnership does righteousness have with unrighteousness? and what fellowship has light with darkness?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And what harmony has Christ with Belial? or what does he who believes have in common with an unbeliever?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And what agreement has the temple of God with idols? for we are the temple of the living God; as God has said, I will live in them, and walk among them; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Therefore, come out from among them, and be separate, says the Lord, and do not touch the unclean thing; and I will welcome you,</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="7">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Therefore, having these promises, dearly beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Open your hearts to us; we have wronged no man, we have corrupted no man, we have defrauded no man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">I do not speak this to condemn you: for I have said before, that you are in our hearts to die with you and to live with you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Great is my confidence in you, great is my pride in you: I am filled with comfort, I am exceedingly joyful in all our tribulation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">For, when we had come into Macedonia, our flesh had no rest, but we were troubled on every side; fighting without, fears within.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But God, who comforts those who are cast down, comforted us by the coming of Titus;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And not by his coming only, but also by the comfort with which he was comforted in you, when he told us of your earnest desire, your mourning, your zeal for me; so that I rejoiced still more.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">For though I made you sorry with a letter, I do not regret it, though I did regret: for I perceive that the letter caused you sorrow, though only for a while.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Now I rejoice, not that you were made sorrowful, but that your sorrow brought you to repentance: for you were made sorrowful in a godly manner, so that you suffered no harm from us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">For godly sorrow produces repentance leading to salvation and leaves no regret: but the sorrow of the world produces death.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">For behold what earnestness this godly sorrow has produced in you, what eagerness to clear yourselves, what indignation, what fear, what longing, what zeal, what readiness to punish wrongdoing! In all things you have shown yourselves to be innocent in this matter.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Therefore, though I wrote to you, I did not do it because of the one who committed the wrong, nor because of the one who suffered the wrong, but that your zeal for us might be revealed to you in the sight of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Therefore we are comforted. And besides our comfort, we especially rejoiced at the joy of Titus, because his spirit was refreshed by you all.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">For if I have boasted at all to him about you, I was not put to shame; but as we spoke all things to you in truth, even so our boasting to Titus has proved true.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And his inward affection abounds even more toward you, as he remembers the obedience of you all, how with fear and trembling you received him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">I rejoice that in all things I have confidence in you.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="8">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And now, brethren, we want you to know of the grace of God bestowed on the churches of Macedonia;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">For during a great test of affliction, the abundance of their joy and their deep poverty overflowed in a wealth of liberality.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">For I bear witness that they gave according to their ability, yea, and beyond their ability, and of their own accord;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Begging us most insistently that we would allow them the privilege of taking part in this service to the saints.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And this they did, not as we expected, but they first gave themselves to the Lord, and to us by the will of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">So we urged Titus, since he had already begun, that he would also finish this gracious work among you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Therefore, as you excel in everything, in faith, and utterance, and knowledge, and in all earnestness, and in your love for us, see that you excel in this gracious work as well.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">I do not speak this as a commandment, but to use the zeal of others to test the sincerity of your own love.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that, though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, that through his poverty you might become rich.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And here I give my advice about what is best for you: a year ago you were the first not only to give, but to desire to do so.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Therefore, complete the doing of it; that as there was a readiness in desiring it, so there may also be a completion of it, according to your means.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">For if there is first a willing mind, it is acceptable, according to what a man has, and not according to that he does not have.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">I do not intend that other men be eased, and you burdened,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">But for there to be equality; at this time your abundance may be a supply for their want, that their abundance may also be a supply for your want: that there may be equality.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">As it is written, He who gathered much did not have too much; and he who gathered little had no lack.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">But thanks be to God, who put the same earnest care for you into the heart of Titus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">For he not only accepted our appeal; but being very earnest, he is going to you of his own accord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And we have sent with him the brother whose fame in the gospel ministry has spread throughout all the churches;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And not only that, but who was also chosen by the churches to travel with us in this gracious work, which is administered by us for the glory of the Lord himself, and to show our good will.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">We intend that that no man should blame us about this abundant gift which we are administering:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">For we take care to do what is honest, not only in the sight of the Lord, but also in the sight of men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And we have sent with them our brother, whom we have often tested and found to be diligent in many things, but now much more diligent, because of the great confidence which he has in you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">As for Titus, he is my partner and fellow worker among you; and as for our brethren, they are messengers of the churches, a glory to Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Therefore show to them, before the churches, the proof of your love, and the reason for our boasting about you.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="9">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now regarding this ministry to the saints, it is superfluous for me to write to you:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">For I know your eagerness, of which I boast to the Macedonians, saying that you in Achaia were ready a year ago; and your zeal has stirred up most of them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">But I have sent the brethren, lest our boasting about you in this matter should be in vain; that, as I said, you may be ready:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Lest if any from Macedonia come with me, and find you unprepared, we (to say nothing of you) should be put to shame by this confidence.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Therefore, I thought it necessary to urge these brethren, that they would go on ahead to you, and arrange beforehand your generous gift, which you promised, that it might be ready, as a willing gift, and not as one grudgingly given.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Now this I say, He who sows sparingly shall also reap sparingly; and he who sows bountifully shall also reap bountifully.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Every man must do as he has decided in his heart; not grudgingly, or under compulsion: for God loves a cheerful giver.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And God is able to make all grace abound to you; that you, always having enough in all things, may abound in every good work.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">As it is written, He has scattered abroad; he has given to the poor: his righteousness endures forever.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Now he who provides seed to the sower and bread for food, will supply and multiply your seed for sowing, and increase the fruits of your righteousness;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">You will be enriched in everything, so you can be generous, and through us your generosity will result in thanksgiving to God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">For the performance of this service not only supplies the wants of the saints, but also overflows in many thanksgivings to God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Because of the proof given by this service, they will glorify God because of your obedience to the gospel of Christ, which you profess, and for your liberal contribution to them, and to all;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And in their prayers, their hearts will go out to you because of the surpassing grace of God in you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Thanks be to God for his inexpressible gift.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="10">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now I, Paul, urge you by the meekness and gentleness of Christ, I who am meek in your presence, but bold when I am absent from you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">I urge you, that when I am present I may not be bold with the confidence with which I expect to be bold against some, who think that we walk according to the flesh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">For though we walk in the flesh, we do not wage war according to the flesh:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">For the weapons of our warfare are not of the flesh, but are mighty before God for the pulling down of strongholds.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">We cast down arguments, and every lofty thing that exalts itself against the knowledge of God, and bring every thought into captivity to the obedience of Christ;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And we have a readiness to punish all disobedience, when your obedience is complete.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Do you look on things according to their outward appearance? If any man trusts that he is Christ's, let him remind himself, that, as he is Christ's, so are we.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">For though I should boast somewhat freely of our authority, which the Lord has given us for building you up, and not for your destruction, I shall not be put to shame.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">I do not wish to seem to be frightening you by my letters.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">For his letters, they say, are weighty and powerful; but his bodily presence is weak, and his speech contemptible.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Let such people realize this, that, the way we are in word by letters when we are absent, so we will also be in deeds when we are present.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">We do not dare to classify or compare ourselves with some who commend themselves: but in measuring themselves by themselves, and comparing themselves among themselves, they are not wise.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">But we will not boast of things without limit, but will keep within the field which God has assigned to us, a field which reaches even to you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">For we do not stretch beyond our limit, as though we had not reached to you: for we were the first to come as far as to you with the gospel of Christ:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">We do not boast of things without limit, that is, of other men's labours; but we have hope, when your faith has increased, that our field among you shall be greatly enlarged,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">So we may preach the gospel in the regions beyond you, and not to boast of work already done in another man's field.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">But he who boasts, let him boast in the Lord.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">I wish you would bear with me a little in my folly: and indeed you are bearing with me.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">But I fear, lest, as the serpent deceived Eve through his cunning, so your minds will be led astray from the simplicity that is in Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">For if one comes and preaches another Jesus, whom we have not preached, or if you receive another spirit, which you have not received, or another gospel, which you have not accepted, you bear with him well enough.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">I consider that I am not in the least inferior to these superlative apostles.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="9">And when I was present with you, and in want, I burdened no man: for that which I lacked the brethren who came from Macedonia supplied: and in all things I have kept myself from being burdensome to you, and so I will continue to do.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">As the truth of Christ is in me, no man in the regions of Achaia shall stop me from this boasting.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Why? because I do not love you? God knows I do.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">But what I do, that I will continue to do, that I may undermine the claim of those who desire opportunity to be regarded as our equals in that of which they boast.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">For such men are false apostles, deceitful workers, disguising themselves as apostles of Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And no wonder; for even Satan disguises himself as an angel of light.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Therefore it is no surprise if his servants are also disguised as servants of righteousness; their end shall be according to their works.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="18">Seeing that many boast according to the flesh, I will boast also.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">For you endure fools gladly, seeing you yourselves are so wise.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">For you bear it if a man brings you into bondage, if a man devours you, if a man takes advantage of you, if a man exalts himself, if a man strikes you on the face.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="9">And he said to me, My grace is sufficient for you: for my strength is made perfect in weakness. Therefore, most gladly will I boast in my weaknesses, that the power of Christ may rest upon me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Therefore, for Christ's sake, I take pleasure in weaknesses, in insults, in hardships, in persecutions, in distresses: for when I am weak, then I am strong.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">I have made a fool of myself; you have compelled me: for I ought to have been commended by you: for in nothing am I behind these superlative apostles, though I am nothing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">The signs of a true apostle were performed among you with all patience, by signs, and wonders, and miracles.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">For in what way were you less favoured than other churches, except that I myself was not burdensome to you? forgive me this wrong.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Behold, for the third time I am ready to come to you; and I will not be burdensome to you: for I do not seek what is yours, but you: for the children ought not to save up for the parents, but the parents for the children.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And I will very gladly spend and be spent for your souls. If I love you more abundantly, am I to be loved the less?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">But be that as it may, I did not burden you: nevertheless, being crafty, I caught you with guile.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Did I take advantage of you by any of those whom I sent to you?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">I urged Titus to go, and with him I sent the brother. Did Titus take advantage of you? did we not act in the same spirit and walk in the same steps?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">All this time have you been thinking that we are defending ourselves to you? we speak before God in Christ: but we do all things, dearly beloved, for your strengthening.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">For I fear that when I come, I shall not find you as I wish, and you shall not find me to be as you wish; lest perhaps there may be quarreling, jealousy, outbursts of wrath, rivalries, slander, gossip, conceit, disorder:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And I fear that, when I come again, my God may humble me before you, and I shall mourn over many who have sinned and have not repented of the impurity and sexual sin and licentiousness which they have committed.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">This is the third time I am coming to you. By the mouths of two or three witnesses must every matter be established.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">The second time I was with you I warned those who have sinned in the past; and now, being absent, I warn them again, and all the others, that, if I come again, I will not spare them,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Since you seek a proof that Christ is speaking through me. He is not weak in dealing with you, but is mighty among you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">For though he was crucified in weakness, yet he lives by the power of God. For we also are weak in him, but we shall live with him by the power of God to serve you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Examine yourselves to see whether you are in the faith; test your own selves. Do you not realize that Jesus Christ is in you, unless indeed you fail the test?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But I trust that you shall know that we have not failed the test.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Now I pray to God that you do no wrong; not that we should appear approved, but that you should do that which is right, even if we appear to be failures.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">For we can do nothing against the truth, but only for the truth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">For we are glad when we are weak, and you are strong: and this is our prayer, for your perfection.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="6">I marvel that you are so quickly deserting him who called you by the grace of Christ, for another gospel:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Which is not truly another; but there are some who trouble you, and would pervert the gospel of Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">But even if we, or an angel from heaven, should preach any other gospel to you than that which we have preached to you, let him be eternally accursed.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="11">But I want you to know, brethren, that the gospel which I preached is not from man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">For I neither received it from man, nor was I taught it, but it came by revelation from Jesus Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">For you have heard of my former life in Judaism, that beyond measure I persecuted the church of God, and tried to destroy it:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And advanced in Judaism beyond many Jews of my age, being more exceedingly zealous for the traditions of my fathers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">But when it pleased God, who set me apart from my mother's womb, and called me by his grace,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">To reveal his Son in me, that I might preach him among the Gentiles; I did not immediately confer with flesh and blood:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Nor did I go up to Jerusalem to those who were apostles before me; but I went into Arabia, and returned again to Damascus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Then, after three years, I went up to Jerusalem to see Peter, and stayed with him fifteen days.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="20">(Now these things which I am writing to you, behold, before God, I do not lie.)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Afterwards I went into the regions of Syria and Cilicia;</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="2">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Then, fourteen years later, I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, and took Titus with me also.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">I went up because of a revelation, and communicated to them the gospel which I preach among the Gentiles, but privately to those who were of repute, lest by any means I should be running, or had run, in vain.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">But not even Titus, who was with me, though a Greek, was compelled to be circumcised.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">That arose because of false brethren who secretly slipped in to spy out the liberty which we have in Christ Jesus, that they might bring us into bondage.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">We did not yield in subjection to them, not even for a hour; that the truth of the gospel might remain with you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But those who seemed to be important, (what they were makes no difference to me: God shows no partiality:) well, those who seemed to be important added nothing to me:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">But instead, when they saw that I had been entrusted with the gospel to the uncircumcised, as Peter had been entrusted with the gospel to the circumcised;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">(For he who worked effectively in Peter in his apostleship to the circumcised, also worked in me for the Gentiles:)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And when James, Cephas, and John, who were reputed to be pillars, perceived the grace that was given to me, they gave to me and Barnabas the right hand of fellowship; that we should go to the Gentiles, and they to the circumcised.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">They only asked that we would remember the poor; the very thing which I also was eager to do.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">But when Peter came to Antioch, I opposed him to his face, because he stood condemned.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">For before certain men came from James, he ate with the Gentiles: but when they had come, he withdrew and separated himself, fearing those who were of the circumcision.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And the other Jews joined him in insincerity; so that even Barnabas was carried away with their insincerity.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">But when I saw that they did not walk uprightly according to the truth of the gospel, I said to Cephas before them all, If you, being a Jew, live like the Gentiles, and not like the Jews, why do you compel the Gentiles to live like the Jews?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">We who are Jews by nature, and not Gentile sinners,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law, but by faith in Jesus Christ, even we have believed in Jesus Christ, that we might be justified by faith in Christ, and not by the works of the law: for by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">But if, while seeking to be justified by Christ, we ourselves are also shown to be sinners, is Christ therefore a minister of sin? God forbid.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">For if I build again the things which I destroyed, I prove myself to be a transgressor.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="20">I have been crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ lives in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="3">
      <VERS vnumber="1">O foolish Galatians, who has bewitched you, before whose eyes Jesus Christ has been publicly portrayed as crucified?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">This one thing I would learn from you, Did you receive the Spirit by works of the law, or by hearing with faith?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Are you so foolish? having begun in the Spirit, are you now being made perfect by the flesh?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Have you suffered so many things in vain? if it really was in vain.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">He who provides to you the Spirit, and works miracles among you, does he do it by the works of the law, or by hearing with faith?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Thus Abraham believed God, and it was credited to him as righteousness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Therefore, understand that those who are of faith are the children of Abraham.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And the scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles through faith, preached the gospel to Abraham beforehand, saying, In you shall all nations be blessed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">So then, those who are of faith are blessed with Abraham, the man of faith.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">For all who depend on the works of the law are under a curse: for it is written, Cursed is everyone who does not continue to do all things which are written in the book of the law.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">But it is evident that no man is justified by the law in the sight of God, for: The just shall live by faith.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">But the law does not rest on faith: rather, The man who does these things shall live by them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Christ has redeemed us from the curse of the law, having been made a curse for us: for it is written, Cursed is every one who hangs on a tree.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">He redeemed us so that the blessing of Abraham might come upon the Gentiles through Jesus Christ; that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Brethren, I speak after the manner of men; Though it is only a man's covenant, yet when it is ratified, no man annuls or adds to it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made. He does not say, And to seeds, as to many; but to one, And to your seed, which is Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And this is what I mean, that the law, which came four hundred and thirty years later, cannot annul the covenant which was previously ratified by God, and thus make the promise void.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">For if the inheritance is based on the law, then it is no longer based on a promise: but God gave it to Abraham by a promise.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Then what purpose does the law serve? It was added because of transgressions, until the seed should come to whom the promise was made. It was ordained by angels through the hand of a mediator.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Now a mediator is not for one party only, but God is one.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Is the law then against the promises of God? Absolutely not: for if there had been a law given which could impart life, then righteousness truly would have been through the law.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">But the scripture has declared all to be prisoners of sin, so that the promise, given on the basis of faith in Jesus Christ, might be given to those who believe.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">But before faith came, we were kept under the law, shut up until faith should be revealed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Therefore, the law was our tutor to bring us to Christ, that we might be justified by faith.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">But now that faith has come, we are no longer under a tutor.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">For you are all sons of God by faith in Christ Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free, there is neither male nor female: for you are all one in Christ Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And if you are Christ's, then you are Abraham's seed, and heirs according to the promise.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="4">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now I say, That the heir, as long as he is a child, does not differ at all from a servant, though he is owner of all;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">But is under guardians and trustees until the time appointed by the father.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">So we, when we were children, were in bondage to the elementary principles of the world:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">But when the time had fully come, God sent forth his Son, born of a woman, born under the law,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">To redeem those who were under the law, that we might be adopted as sons.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And because you are sons, God has sent forth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying, Abba, Father.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Therefore, you are no longer a slave, but a son; and if a son, then an heir through God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">But previously, when you did not know God, you were slaves to those who by nature are not gods.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">But now that you have come to know God, or rather, to be known by God, how is it that you turn back again to those weak and beggarly principles, to which you again desire to be in bondage?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">You observe days, and months, and seasons, and years.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">I am afraid for you, lest I have bestowed labour upon you in vain.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Brethren, I urge you, be as I am; for I became as you are: you have not injured me at all.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">You know it was because of infirmity of the flesh that I first preached the gospel to you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And though my fleshly condition was a trial for you, you did not despise or reject me; but received me as an angel from God, as Christ Jesus himself.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Where then is the blessed joy you had? for I bear you witness, that, if possible, you would have plucked out your own eyes, and have given them to me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Have I therefore become your enemy, because I tell you the truth?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">They zealously seek you, but not for good; they would alienate you, that you might seek them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">But it is always good to be zealously sought after in a good way, and not only when I am present with you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">My little children, with whom I again suffer birth pains until Christ is formed in you,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">I desire to be present with you now, and to change my tone; for I am perplexed about you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Tell me, you who desire to be under the law, do you not hear the law?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">For it is written that Abraham had two sons, one by a slave woman, the other by a free woman.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">He who was born by the slave woman was born according to the flesh; but the son born by the free woman was through the promise.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">These things are an allegory: for these women are the two covenants; the one from mount Sinai, who bears children into bondage; this is Hagar.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">For this Hagar is mount Sinai in Arabia, and corresponds to the present Jerusalem, which is in bondage with her children.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">But the Jerusalem which is above is free, and she is our mother.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">For it is written, Rejoice, you who are barren and bear no children; break forth and shout, you who are not in the pangs of birth: for the desolate woman has many more children than she who has a husband.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Now we, brethren, like Isaac, are the children of promise.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">But as it was then, he who was born according to the flesh persecuted him who was born according to the Spirit, so it is now.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Nevertheless, what does the scripture say? Cast out the slave woman and her son: for the son of the slave woman shall not be an heir with the son of the free woman.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">So then, brethren, we are not children of the slave woman, but of the free woman.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="5">
      <VERS vnumber="1">It is for liberty that Christ has made us free. Therefore, stand fast and do not submit again to a yoke of slavery.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Behold, I, Paul say to you, that if you are circumcised, Christ shall be of no value to you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">For I testify again to every man who receives circumcision, that he is obliged to obey the whole law.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">You who would be justified by the law, you have been alienated from Christ; you have fallen from grace.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">For we through the Spirit, by faith, wait for the hope of righteousness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">For in Jesus Christ neither circumcision nor uncircumcision counts for anything; but faith which works through love.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">You ran well; who hindered you, that you should not obey the truth?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">This persuasion does not come from him who calls you.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="12">I wish those who trouble you would even emasculate themselves.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">For, brethren, you have been called to liberty; only do not use your liberty as an opportunity for the flesh, but in love serve one another.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">For all the law is fulfilled in one command; You shall love your neighbour as yourself.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">But if you bite and devour one another, take heed that you are not consumed by one another.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">This I say, Walk in the Spirit, and you shall not fulfill the desires of the flesh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">For the desires of the flesh are against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh: and these are in conflict with one another: so that you cannot do the things that you wish.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the law.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Now the works of the flesh are obvious; they are; sexual immorality, impurity, licentiousness,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, strife, jealousy, fits of rage, selfishness, dissensions, factions,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Envy, drunkenness, orgies, and the like: of which I forewarn you, as I have also warned you in the past, that those who do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Gentleness, self-control: against such things there is no law.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And those who are Christ's have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">If we live by the Spirit, let us also walk by the Spirit.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">For if a man thinks himself to be something, when he is nothing, he deceives himself.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="27">That he might present her to himself a glorious church, without spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; but that she should be holy and without blemish.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">So husbands ought to love their wives as their own bodies. He who loves his wife loves himself.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">For no man ever hated his own flesh; but he nourishes and cherishes it, just as the Lord does the church:</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="31">For this reason a man shall leave his father and mother, and be joined to his wife, and the two shall be one flesh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">This is a great mystery: but I speak concerning Christ and the church.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">I thank my God upon every remembrance of you,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="8">And being found in form as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient to the point of death, even death on a cross.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Therefore, God has highly exalted him, and given him the name which is above every name:</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="26">For he longed after you all, and was full of distress, because you had heard that he had been sick.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Indeed he was sick, and near to death: but God had mercy on him; and not on him only, but also on me, lest I should have sorrow upon sorrow.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Therefore, I sent him the more eagerly, that, when you see him again, you may rejoice, and I may be less anxious.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Therefore, receive him in the Lord with all gladness; and hold such men in high regard:</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">For we are the true circumcision, who worship God in the spirit, and rejoice in Christ Jesus, and put no confidence in the flesh,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Though I myself might have confidence in the flesh. If any other man thinks that he has reason to trust in the flesh, I have more:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Circumcised the eighth day, of the people of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew of Hebrews; regarding the law, a Pharisee;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Concerning zeal, a persecutor of the church; regarding the righteousness which is of the law, blameless.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">But whatever things were gain to me, those I have counted as loss for Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Furthermore, I count all things as loss compared to the excellency of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord: for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and count them as rubbish, that I may win Christ,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And be found in him, not having my own righteousness, based on the law, but that which is through faith in Christ, the righteousness which is from God by faith:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">That I may know him, and the power of his resurrection, and the fellowship of his sufferings, becoming like him in his death;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">If only I might attain to the resurrection of the dead.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="13">Brethren, I do not consider myself to have laid hold of it yet: but this one thing I do, forgetting those things which are behind, and reaching forth to those things which are ahead,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Furthermore, we urge you, brethren, and exhort you in the Lord Jesus, that as you have learned from us how you ought to walk and to please God, as indeed you are doing, so you would do more and more.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">For you know what commandments we gave you by the authority of the Lord Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">For this is the will of God: your sanctification, that you should abstain from sexual immorality,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">That every one of you should know how to possess his own vessel in holiness and honour;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Not in the lust of passion, as the Gentiles who do not know God:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">That no man might transgress and defraud his brother in any matter: because the Lord is the avenger in all these things, as we also have told you and warned you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">For God has not called us to impurity, but to holiness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Therefore, he who rejects this, does not reject man, but God, who has also given you his Holy Spirit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">But regarding brotherly love you do not need any one to write to you: for you yourselves have been taught by God to love one another.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="13">Now I would not have you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning those who are asleep, that you may not sorrow, as others who have no hope.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so God will bring with him those who sleep in Jesus.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="7">For those who sleep, sleep in the night; and those who get drunk, get drunk in the night.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">But let us, who are of the day, be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love; and for a helmet, the hope of salvation.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">Let no man deceive you in any way: for that day shall not come, until there is first a falling away, and the man of lawlessness is revealed, the son of perdition;</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="6">And you know what restrains him now, that he might be revealed in his time.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="8">And then shall the lawless one be revealed, whom the Lord shall slay with the breath of his mouth, and shall destroy by the brightness of his coming.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">The coming of the lawless one is through the working of Satan, with all power and signs and lying wonders,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="11">And for this reason God shall send them a strong delusion, that they should believe a lie:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">That all those might be condemned who did not believe the truth, but took pleasure in unrighteousness.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="7">For you yourselves know how you ought to imitate us: for we were not idle among you;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Nor did we eat any man's bread without paying; but with labour and toil we worked night and day, that we might not be a burden to any of you:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Not because we do not have the right, but to make ourselves an example for you to follow.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">For even when we were with you, we gave you this command: if any will not work, neither shall he eat.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">For we hear that there are some among you who walk in idleness, not working at all, mere busybodies.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Now those who are such we command and exhort by our Lord Jesus Christ, that they work quietly, and eat their own bread.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">But you, brethren, do not be weary in doing good.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And if any man will not obey our instruction in this letter, note that man, and do not associate with him, that he may be ashamed.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="8">You have put all things in subjection under his feet. For in putting all in subjection under him, he left nothing that is not under him. But now we do not yet see all things put under him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">But we see Jesus, who was made for a little while lower than the angels, crowned with glory and honour because he suffered death; that he, by the grace of God, should taste death for every man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">For it was fitting that he, for whom are all things, and by whom are all things, in bringing many sons to glory, should make the author of their salvation perfect through suffering.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">For both he who sanctifies and those who are sanctified are all of one family: for which reason he is not ashamed to call them brethren,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Saying, I will declare your name to my brethren, in the midst of the congregation I will sing praises to you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And again, I will put my trust in him. And again, Behold, here am I, and the children whom God has given me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Since then, as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he himself also partook of the same; that through death he might destroy him who had the power of death, that is, the devil;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And deliver those who through fear of death were all their lives subject to bondage.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">For truly he does not help angels; but he helps the descendants of Abraham.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Therefore, in all things he had to be made like his brethren, that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to God, to make atonement for the sins of the people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">For since he himself has suffered in being tempted, he is able to help those who are tempted.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="3">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Therefore, holy brethren, partakers of the heavenly calling, consider Jesus, the Apostle and High Priest of our profession;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Who was faithful to him who appointed him, as also Moses was faithful in all his house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">For this man was counted worthy of more glory than Moses, just as he who has built the house has more honour than the house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">For every house has been built by someone; but he who is the builder of all things is God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And Moses was faithful in all his house, as a servant, as a testimony of those things which were to be spoken later;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But Christ was faithful as a son over his own house, whose house we are, if we hold fast our confidence and our joyful hope.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Therefore, as the Holy Spirit says, Today if you hear his voice,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Do not harden your hearts, as in the rebellion, on the day of testing in the wilderness:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">When your fathers tested me, tried me, and saw my works for forty years.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Therefore I was angry with that generation, and said, They always go astray in their hearts; and they have not known my ways.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">So I swore in my wrath, They shall not enter my rest.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Take heed, brethren, lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief, leading you to turn away from the living God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">But encourage one another daily, while it is called Today; lest any of you be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">For we have become partakers of Christ, if we hold our first confidence steadfast to the end;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">While it is said, Today if you will hear his voice, do not harden your hearts, as in the rebellion.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">For who were those who rebelled when they had heard? was it not all those who came out of Egypt led by Moses?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And with whom was he angry for forty years? was it not with those who had sinned, whose bodies fell in the wilderness?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And to whom did he swear that they should not enter his rest, but to those who disobeyed?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">So we see that they could not enter in because of unbelief.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="4">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Therefore, let us fear, lest while a promise of entering into his rest remains, any of you should seem to fall short of it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">For the gospel was preached to us, as well as to them: but the word preached did not benefit them, because it was not combined with faith in those who heard it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">For we who have believed enter into that rest, as he said, As I have sworn in my wrath, they shall never enter my rest: although his works were finished from the foundation of the world.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">For he spoke in a certain place of the seventh day in this manner, And God rested on the seventh day from all his works.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And again in this passage, They shall never enter my rest.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Therefore, since it remains that some must enter in, and those to whom it was first preached did not enter in because of unbelief:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">He again fixes a certain day, calling it Today, saying through David after so long a time, as was said before, Today if you hear his voice, do not harden your hearts.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">For if Joshua had given them rest, then he would not afterward have spoken of another day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Therefore, there remains a sabbath rest for the people of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">For he who has entered his rest, has also has ceased from his own works, as God did from his.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Therefore, let us labour to enter that rest, lest any man fall by following their example of disobedience.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">For the word of God is alive, and active, and sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing even to the division of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and discerning the thoughts and intents of the heart.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Nor is there any creature concealed from his sight: but all are naked and exposed to the eyes of him to whom we must give account.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Seeing then that we have a great high priest, who has passed through the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our confession.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">For we do not have a high priest who cannot sympathize with our infirmities; but one who in every respect was tempted as we are, yet without sin.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Therefore, let us boldly approach the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="5">
      <VERS vnumber="1">For every high priest chosen from among men is ordained to represent men in things pertaining to God, to offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">He can have compassion on the ignorant, and on those who are going astray; for he also is subject to weakness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And for this reason he must offer sacrifices for sins, both for the people, and for himself.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And no man takes this honour upon himself, but he is called by God, as was Aaron.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">So also Christ did not exalt himself to be made a high priest; but was appointed by him who said to him, You are my Son, today I have begotten you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">As he also says in another place, You are a priest forever in the order of Melchizedek.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">In the days of his flesh, he offered up prayers and supplications with strong crying and tears to him who was able to save him from death, and he was heard because of his piety.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Though he was a Son, yet he learned obedience through the things which he suffered;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And being made perfect, he became the author of eternal salvation for all those who obey him;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Being named by God as a high priest in the order of Melchizedek.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Of him we have many things to say which are hard to explain, since you have become dull of hearing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">For though by this time you ought to be teachers, you have need for someone to teach you again the first principles of the oracles of God. You have come to need milk, and not solid food.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">For everyone who lives on milk is unskilled in the word of righteousness: for he is a babe.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">But solid food belongs to those who are of full age, those who by practice have their senses trained to discern both good and evil.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="6">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Therefore, leaving the elementary principles of the doctrine of Christ, let us go on to perfection; not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works, and of faith toward God,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Of instructions about baptisms, and of the laying on of hands, and of the resurrection of the dead, and of eternal judgment.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And this we will do, if God permits.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">For it is impossible for those who were once enlightened, and have tasted of the heavenly gift, and have been made partakers of the Holy Spirit,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And have tasted the good word of God, and the powers of the world to come,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">If they shall fall away, to be brought back again to repentance; for they crucify to themselves the Son of God afresh, and hold him up to public disgrace.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">For the earth which drinks in the rain that comes often upon it, and brings forth vegetation useful for those by whom it is farmed, receives a blessing from God:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">But that which bears thorns and thistles is worthless, and is near to being cursed; its end is to be burned.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">But, beloved, though we speak thus, we are persuaded of better things concerning you, things that accompany salvation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">For God is not unrighteous, so as to forget the work and love which you have shown for his name's sake in having ministered to the saints, as you continue to do.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And we desire that every one of you show the same diligence in realizing the full assurance of hope until the end:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">That you may not grow slothful, but be followers of those who through faith and patience inherit the promises.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">For when God made a promise to Abraham, because he could swear by no one greater, he swore by himself,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Saying, Surely I will bless you and I will multiply you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And so, after he had patiently endured, he obtained the promise.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">For truly, men swear by one who is greater than themselves: and an oath given for confirmation puts an end to all disputes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Therefore God, wanting to show more clearly to the heirs of the promise the immutable nature of his purpose, confirmed it by an oath:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">That by two immutable things, in which it is impossible for God to lie, we who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set before us might have a strong encouragement.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">This hope we have as an anchor of the soul, both sure and steadfast, which enters within the veil;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Where Jesus, the forerunner, has entered for us, having become a high priest forever in the order of Melchizedek.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="7">
      <VERS vnumber="1">For this Melchizedek, king of Salem, priest of the most high God, met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings, and blessed him;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And to him Abraham gave a tenth part of everything. He is first, by interpretation of his name, King of righteousness, and after that is also King of Salem, which is, King of peace.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">He is without father, without mother, without genealogy, having neither beginning of days, nor end of life; but like the Son of God, he remains a priest continually.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Now consider how great this man was: to him even the patriarch Abraham gave a tenth of the spoils.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And truly, those who are of the sons of Levi, who receive the office of the priesthood, have a commandment in the law to take tithes from the people, that is, from their brethren, though these also come out of the loins of Abraham:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But he whose descent is not traced from them received a tithe from Abraham, and blessed him who had the promises.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And without any dispute, the lesser is blessed by the greater.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And here, men who die receive tithes; but there, they are received by him of whom it is witnessed that he lives.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And, one might even say, Levi, who receives tithes, payed tithes through Abraham.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">For he was yet in the loins of his father, when Melchizedek met him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Therefore, if perfection was from the Levitical priesthood, (for under it the people received the law,) what further need was there for another priest to arise, in the order of Melchizedek, and not in the order of Aaron?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">For when the priesthood is changed, there is, of necessity, also a change in the law.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">For he of whom these things are spoken is from another tribe, from which no man ever served at the altar.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">For it is evident that our Lord sprang out of Judah; and of this tribe Moses spoke nothing concerning priests.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And this becomes far more evident when, in the likeness of Melchizedek, another priest arises,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Who is made such, not by a law concerning a physical requirement, but by the power of an endless life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">For it is testified of him, You are a priest forever in the order of Melchizedek.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">So, there is a setting aside of the former commandment because of its weakness and uselessness,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">(For the law made nothing perfect;) but there is the bringing in of a better hope; by which we draw near to God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And it was not without an oath.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">For others were indeed made priests without an oath; but he with an oath from the one who said to him, The Lord has sworn and will not change his mind, You are a priest forever.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">By this has Jesus become the guarantee of a better covenant.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And there were many priests, because they were prevented by death from continuing:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">But he, because he continues forever, has a perpetual priesthood.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Therefore, he is also able to completely save those who come to God through him, for he ever lives to make intercession for them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">For it was fitting for us to have such a high priest, holy, blameless, undefiled, separate from sinners, and exalted above the heavens;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Who has no need, as do those high priests, to offer up daily sacrifices, first for his own sins, and then for those of the people: for this he did once for all, when he offered up himself.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">For the law appoints men, who are frail, to be high priests; but the word of the oath, which came after the law, appoints the Son, who has been made perfect forever.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="8">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now of that which we have spoken, this is the sum: We have such a high priest, who is seated on the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in heaven;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">A minister in the sanctuary, in the true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, not man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">For every high priest is appointed to offer gifts and sacrifices: therefore it is necessary that this one also have something to offer.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Now if he were on earth, he would not be a priest, for there are priests who offer gifts according to the law.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">They serve at a copy and shadow of the heavenly sanctuary. This is why, when Moses was about to make the tabernacle, he was warned by God, saying, See that you make all things according to the pattern shown to you on the mountain.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But now he has obtained a ministry that is as much superior to the old as the covenant of which he is the mediator is superior, for it was established upon better promises.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">For if the first covenant had been faultless, then there would have been no occasion sought for a second.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">For he finds fault with them, saying, Behold, the days will come, says the Lord, when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Not like the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day when I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt; for they did not continue in my covenant, and I turned away from them, says the Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, says the Lord; I will put my laws into their minds, and write them on their hearts: and I will be their God, and they shall be my people:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And no longer shall every man teach his neighbour, and every man his brother, saying, Know the Lord: for all shall know me, from the least to the greatest.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">For I will be merciful to their unrighteousness, and their sins I will remember no more.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">When he says, A new covenant, he has made the first one obsolete. Now that which is obsolete and grows old is ready to vanish away.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="9">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now truly, the first covenant had ordinances of divine service, and an earthly sanctuary.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">For there was a tabernacle prepared, in the first room of which was the lampstand, and the table, and the bread of the presence; this is called the sanctuary.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And behind the second veil stood the room of the tabernacle which is called the Holiest of all;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Which had the golden altar of incense, and the ark of the covenant overlaid round about with gold, in which was the golden jar that had manna, and Aaron's rod that budded, and the tables of the covenant;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And over it were the cherubim of glory overshadowing the mercy seat; of which we cannot now speak in detail.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Now when these preparations had been made, the priests went regularly into the first room of the tabernacle, performing their ministry.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">But into the second the high priest went alone, once every year, and not without blood, which he offered for himself, and for the sins the people committed in ignorance.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">By this the Holy Spirit signifies that the way into the holiest of all has not yet been disclosed, while the first room of the tabernacle remains standing,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Which is a symbol for the present age, in which both gifts and sacrifices are offered which cannot make the worshipper perfect in conscience;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">For they are only a matter of food and drink, and various washings, and regulations for the body, imposed until the time of reformation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">But when Christ appeared as a high priest of the good things to come, then, through a greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, that is to say, not of this creation;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Nor by the blood of goats and calves, but by his own blood, he entered once for all into the holy place, having obtained eternal redemption.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">For if the blood of bulls and of goats, and the ashes of a heifer sprinkling those who are unclean, sanctifies them so their flesh is clean:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">How much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to God, cleanse your consciences from dead works to serve the living God?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And for this reason he is the mediator of a new covenant, since a death has taken place for the redemption of the transgressions committed under the first covenant, those who are called may receive the promised eternal inheritance.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">For where there is a will, the death of the testator must be established.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">For a will is in force only upon death: it has no strength at all while the testator lives.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Therefore, even the first covenant was not inaugurated without blood.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">For when Moses had spoken every commandment to all the people according to the law, he took the blood of calves and of goats, with water, and scarlet wool, and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book, and all the people,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Saying, This is the blood of the covenant which God has commanded you to keep.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">In the same way, he sprinkled with blood both the tabernacle, and all the vessels used in the ministry.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Indeed, under the law almost all things are cleansed with blood; and without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">It was, therefore, necessary that the copies of the heavenly things should be purified with these sacrifices; but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">For Christ has not entered a holy place made with hands, a copy of the true one; but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Nor does he need to offer himself often, as the high priest enters into the holy place every year with blood not his own;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">For then he would have needed to suffer often since the foundation of the world: but now he has appeared once at the end of the ages to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And as it is appointed for men once to die, and after this comes judgment:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">So Christ, having been offered once to bear the sins of many; shall appear a second time, not to bear sin, but to bring full salvation to those who eagerly await him.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="10">
      <VERS vnumber="1">For the law, being only a shadow of the good things to come, and not the very image of the things, can never by those sacrifices, which are offered year by year, continually, make perfect those who draw near.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Otherwise, would they not have ceased being offered? because the worshippers, once cleansed, would no longer have had a consciousness of sins.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">But those sacrifices are a reminder of sins every year.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">For it is not possible that the blood of bulls and of goats should take away sins.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Therefore, when he came into the world, he said, Sacrifice and offering you did not desire, but a body you have prepared for me;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">In burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin you have had no pleasure.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Then I said, Lo, I come (in the scroll of the book it is written of me,) to do your will, O God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">After he said above, Sacrifices and offerings and burnt offerings and offerings for sin you did not desire, neither did you have pleasure in them, which are offered according to the law;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Then said he, Lo, I come to do your will, O God. He takes away the first, that he may establish the second.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And by that will we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Every priest stands daily ministering and offering, time and again, the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">But this man, after he had offered one sacrifice for sins forever, sat down on the right hand of God;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">From that time on waiting until his enemies are made his footstool.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">For by one offering he has perfected forever those who are sanctified.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And the Holy Spirit also is a witness to us: for after he said,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">This is the covenant that I will make with them after those days, says the Lord, I will put my laws into their hearts, and in their minds I will write them;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Then he adds, Their sins and iniquities I will remember no more.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Now where there is forgiveness of these, there is no longer an offering for sin.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Therefore, brethren, having boldness to enter the most holy place by the blood of Jesus,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">By a new and living way which he has opened for us through the veil, that is to say, his flesh;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And since we have a high priest over the house of God,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled clean from an evil conscience, and our bodies washed with pure water.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Let us hold fast the profession of our hope, without wavering; (for he who promised is faithful;)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And let us consider how to arouse one another to love and to good works:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as is the manner of some; but exhorting one another: and so much the more, as you see the day approaching.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">For if we sin wilfully after we have received the knowledge of the truth, there remains no more sacrifice for sins,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">But a certain fearful expectation of judgment and fiery indignation, which shall devour the adversaries.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">He who despised Moses' law died without mercy on the testimony of two or three witnesses:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">How much more severe punishment do you suppose he shall deserve, who has trodden under foot the Son of God, and has counted the blood of the covenant, with which he was sanctified, an unholy thing, and has affronted the Spirit of grace?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">For we know him who has said, Vengeance belongs to me, I will repay. And again, The Lord shall judge his people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">But call to remembrance the former days, in which, after you were illuminated, you endured a great struggle in the face of afflictions;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">Sometimes you were made a public spectacle by insults and afflictions; and sometimes, because you became companions to those who were so treated.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">For you had compassion on the prisoners, and joyfully accepted the confiscation of your goods, knowing that you have a better possession, and an enduring one.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">Therefore, do not cast away your confidence, which has a great reward.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">For you have need of endurance, that, after you have done the will of God, you might receive the promise.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="38">But my righteous one shall live by faith: but if any man draws back, my soul shall have no pleasure in him.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Now faith is the assurance of things hoped for, the conviction of things not seen.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">For by it the men of old obtained approval.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God, so that things which are seen were made of things which do not appear.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">By faith Abel offered to God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain, and by it he obtained the testimony that he was righteous, God testifying of his gifts: and by faith, though he is dead, yet he speaks.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">By faith Enoch was caught up so that he should not see death; and he was not found, because God had taken him: now before he was taken he received this testimony, that he pleased God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But without faith it is impossible to please him: for he who comes to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of those who diligently seek him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">By faith Noah, being warned by God of things not yet seen, reverently prepared an ark for the saving of his household; by which he condemned the world, and became heir of the righteousness which is by faith.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">By faith Abraham, when he was called to go out to a place which he should later receive as an inheritance, obeyed; and he went out, not knowing where he was to go.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">By faith he sojourned in the land of promise, as in a foreign country, dwelling in tents with Isaac and Jacob, heirs with him of the same promise:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">For he looked for a city which has foundations, whose architect and builder is God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Through faith Sarah herself received the ability to conceive, and delivered a child when she was past age, because she judged him faithful who had promised.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Therefore there was born from one man, and him as good as dead, a multitude as great as the stars of the sky, and as innumerable as the sand which is on the sea shore.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">These all died in faith, not having received the promises, but having seen them afar off; and they were persuaded of them, and embraced them, and confessed that they were strangers and exiles on the earth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">For those who say such things declare plainly that they seek a country of their own.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And truly, if they had been thinking of that country from which they came out, they would have had opportunity to return.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Instead, they desire a better country, that is, a heavenly one. Therefore God is not ashamed to be called their God: for he has prepared for them a city.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">By faith Abraham, when he was tested, offered up Isaac: he who had received the promises was ready to offer up his only begotten son,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Of whom it was said, In Isaac shall your descendants be named:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">For he reasoned that God was able to raise him up, even from the dead; from which, figuratively, he did receive him back.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau concerning things to come.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">By faith Jacob, when he was dying, blessed each of the sons of Joseph; and worshipped, leaning upon the top of his staff.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">By faith Joseph, at the end of his life, made mention of the exodus of the children of Israel; and gave orders concerning his bones.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">By faith Moses, when he was born, was hidden for three months by his parents, because they saw he was a beautiful child; and they were not afraid of the king's decree.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">By faith Moses, when he was grown, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of God, than to enjoy the fleeting pleasures of sin;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Considering abuse for the sake of Christ greater riches than the treasures of Egypt: for he looked ahead to the reward.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">By faith he left Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king: for he endured, as seeing him who is invisible.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">By faith he kept the passover, and the sprinkling of blood, lest he who destroyed the firstborn should touch them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">By faith they passed through the Red sea as on dry land: but when the Egyptians attempted to do so, they were drowned.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="31">By faith the prostitute Rahab did not perish with those who were disobedient, because she had received the spies in peace.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">And what more shall I say? for time would fail me if I told of Gideon, and of Barak, and of Samson, and of Jephthah; of David, and Samuel, and of the prophets:</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="34">Quenched the power of the raging fire, escaped the edge of the sword, out of weakness were made strong, grew mighty in battle, turned foreign armies to flight.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">Women received their dead, raised to life again: and others were tortured, not accepting deliverance; that they might obtain a better resurrection:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">And others suffered mockings and scourgings, yea, even chains and imprisonment:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">They were stoned, they were sawn apart, they were tempted, they were slain with the sword: they wandered about in sheepskins and goatskins; being destitute, afflicted, tormented;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">(Men of whom the world was not worthy:) they wandered in deserts, and in mountains, and in dens and caves of the earth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">And all these, having obtained approval through their faith, did not receive the promise,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">For consider him who endured such hostility from sinners against himself, lest you grow weary and fainthearted.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">You have not yet resisted to the point of shedding your blood in your striving against sin.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And you have forgotten the exhortation which speaks to you as sons, My son, do not think lightly of the discipline of the Lord, nor faint when you are rebuked by him:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">For whom the Lord loves, he disciplines, and scourges every son whom he receives.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">You must endure for discipline. God deals with you as with sons; for what son is there whom his father does not discipline?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">But if you are left without discipline, of which all are partakers, then are you are illegitimate children, and not sons.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Furthermore, we have had earthly fathers who corrected us, and we gave them respect: shall we not much more be in subjection to the Father of spirits, and live?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">For they disciplined us for a short time as seemed best to them; but he disciplines us for our good, that we might be partakers of his holiness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">At the time, no discipline seems to be joyful, but painful: nevertheless, afterward it yields the peaceable fruit of righteousness for those who have been trained by it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Therefore, strengthen the hands which hang down, and the feeble knees;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And make straight paths for your feet, so that which is lame may not be put out of joint; but rather be healed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Follow peace with all men, and holiness, without which no man shall see the Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">See to it that no man fails to obtain the grace of God; lest any root of bitterness springing up should trouble you, and thereby defile many;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">That there be no sexually immoral, or godless person, like Esau, who for one meal sold his birthright.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">For you know that afterward, when he wanted to inherit the blessing, he was rejected: for he found no place for repentance, though he sought it with tears.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">For you have not come to a mountain that may be touched, that burns with fire, and to darkness, and gloom, and tempest,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And the sound of a trumpet, and the voice whose words made those who heard beg that no further word should be spoken to them.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="26">And his voice shook the earth then: but now he has promised, saying, Yet once more I will shake not only the earth, but also heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And the words, Yet once more, signify the removal of those things which can be shaken, of created things, that those things which cannot be shaken may remain.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Therefore, since we receive a kingdom which cannot be shaken, let us be grateful, and worship God acceptably, with reverence and awe:</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">Your gold and silver is corroded; and their rust shall be a witness against you, and shall eat your flesh as if it were fire. You have heaped treasure together in the last days.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Behold, the wages of the labourers who have reaped your fields, which you withheld, cry out against you: and the cries of those who reaped have been heard by the ears of the Lord of hosts.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">You have lived in luxury on the earth, and in self-indulgence; you have fattened your hearts, as in a day of slaughter.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">You have condemned and killed the just man; and he does not resist you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Therefore be patient, brethren, until the coming of the Lord. Behold, the farmer waits for the precious fruit of the earth, and is patient for it, until it receives the early and the late rains.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">You also be patient; establish your hearts: for the coming of the Lord draws near.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="14">Is anyone among you sick? let him call for the elders of the church; and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord:</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, to the exiles scattered throughout Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Chosen according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, and sanctified by the Spirit for obedience to Jesus Christ and sprinkling by his blood: Grace and peace be multiplied to you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who by his abundant mercy has given us new birth into a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">To an imperishable and undefiled inheritance, that does not fade away, reserved in heaven for you,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Who are guarded by the power of God through faith for a salvation ready to be revealed in the last time.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">In this you greatly rejoice, though now for a time you may have to suffer various trials:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">That the genuineness of your faith, being much more precious than gold, which perishes, though it is tested by fire, might be found to result in praise and honour and glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Though you have not seen him, you love him; and though you do not see him now, yet you believe in him and rejoice with inexpressible and glorious joy:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Receiving the outcome of your faith, the salvation of your souls.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Of this salvation, the prophets who prophesied of the grace that should come to you enquired and searched diligently:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Seeking to find to whom and when the Spirit of Christ within them was pointing, when he testified beforehand of the sufferings of Christ, and the glories that should follow.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">It was revealed to them that they did not serve themselves, but you, in the things which have now been made known to you by those who preached the gospel to you through the Holy Spirit sent down from heaven; things into which angels desire to look.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Therefore gird up your minds, be sober, and fix your hope fully on the grace that is to be brought to you at the revelation of Jesus Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Live as obedient children, not conforming yourselves to the lusts of your former ignorance:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">But as he who has called you is holy, so be holy in all your conduct;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Because it is written, Be holy; for I am holy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And if you address as Father the one who without partiality judges according to every man's work, then pass the time of your stay on earth in reverent fear:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">For you know that you were not redeemed with perishable things, such as silver and gold, from the vain way of life you inherited from your fathers;</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="20">Who was chosen before the foundation of the world, but was revealed in these last times for you,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Who through him believe in God, who raised him up from the dead, and gave him glory; that your faith and hope might be in God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Since you have purified your souls by obeying the truth, so you have a sincere love of the brethren; love one another fervently from the heart.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">You have been born again, not of perishable seed, but of imperishable, by the word of God, which lives and abides forever.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">For, All flesh is like grass, and all its glory is like the flower of grass. The grass withers, and the flower falls away,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">Since you have tasted the kindness of the Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Coming to him as to a living stone, rejected by men, but chosen by God, and precious,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">You also, as living stones, are being built up into a spiritual house, a holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God through Jesus Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">For this is contained in the scripture, Behold, I lay in Zion a cornerstone, chosen and precious: and he who believes in him shall not be put to shame.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Therefore, to you who believe, he is precious: but to those who disbelieve, the stone which the builders rejected has become the very cornerstone,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And a stone of stumbling, and a rock of offence; they stumble at the word, being disobedient: as they were appointed to do.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">But you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people belonging to God; that you should declare the praises of him who has called you out of darkness into his marvellous light.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">In times past you were not a people, but now you are the people of God: once you had not obtained mercy, but now you have obtained mercy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Dearly beloved, I urge you as aliens and strangers, abstain from fleshly lusts, which wage war against the soul.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Conduct yourselves righteously among the Gentiles: that, though they speak against you as evildoers, they may behold your good works and glorify God on the day of visitation.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="16">Live as free men, not using your liberty as a cloak for evil, but live as the servants of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Honour all men. Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Honour the king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Servants, be subject to your masters with all respect; not only to the good and gentle, but also to the perverse.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">For this is commendable, if for the sake of conscience toward God, a man endures sorrow while suffering wrongfully.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">For what credit is there, if, when you are beaten for your wrongs, you endure it patiently? but if, when you do well, and suffer for it, you endure it patiently, this is commendable before God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">For to this you were called: because Christ also suffered for you, leaving you an example, that you should follow his steps.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">He committed no sin, nor was any deceit found in his mouth;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And when he was reviled, he did not revile in return; and when he suffered, he did not threaten; but committed himself to him who judges righteously.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">He himself bore our sins in his own body on the tree, that we might die to sins and live to righteousness; by his wounds you have been healed.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Likewise, you wives, be in subjection to your husbands; so that, if any do not obey the word, they may be won without a word by the behaviour of the wives;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">When they behold your chaste and reverent behaviour.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Let your beauty not be in outward adornment; the plaiting of hair, the wearing of gold, or the putting on of apparel;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">But let it be of the inner person of your heart, the unfading beauty of a gentle and quiet spirit, which is precious in the sight of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">For in this manner the holy women in days of old, who trusted in God, adorned themselves, and were submissive to their husbands.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Thus Sarah obeyed Abraham, calling him lord: and you are her daughters, if you do right, and do not give way to fear.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Likewise, you husbands, live with your wives considerately, giving honour to the woman as the weaker vessel, since you are heirs together of the grace of life. Do this that your prayers may not be hindered.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Finally, be of one mind, have sympathy for one another, love as brethren, be compassionate, be humble.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Do not return evil for evil, or insult for insult: but instead with blessing; knowing that you were called to this, that you should inherit a blessing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">For, He who would love life, and see good days, let him restrain his tongue from evil, and his lips from speaking guile:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Let him turn from evil, and do good; let him seek peace, and pursue it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">For the eyes of the Lord are upon the righteous, and his ears are open to their prayers: but the face of the Lord is against those who do evil.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And who will harm you if you are zealous followers of that which is good?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">But even if you do suffer for righteousness' sake, you are blessed. And do not be afraid of their threats, nor be troubled;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">But set apart Christ as Lord in your hearts: and always be ready to give an answer to every man who asks you the reason for the hope that is in you; but do it with gentleness and respect,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Keeping a good conscience, so that when you are falsely accused, those who revile your good behaviour in Christ may be ashamed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">For it is better, if it is the will of God, that you suffer for doing right, than for doing evil.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">For Christ died for sins once for all, the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh, but made alive in the spirit,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">In which he went and preached to the spirits in prison,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Who long ago were disobedient, when God patiently waited in the days of Noah, while the ark was prepared, in which a few, that is, eight people, were saved through water.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">This water symbolizes baptism, which now saves us (not by the removal of dirt from the body, but by an appeal of a good conscience to God,) through the resurrection of Jesus Christ,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Who has gone into heaven, and is on the right hand of God; with angels and authorities and powers made subject to him.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="4">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Therefore, since Christ has suffered in the flesh, arm yourselves with the same mind: for he who has suffered in the flesh has ceased from sin;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">That he may live the rest of his time in the flesh no longer for the lusts of men, but for the will of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">For the time past was sufficient for doing the things the Gentiles desire to do: living in debauchery, lust, drunkenness, revelling, carousing, and abominable idolatries.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">They think it strange that you do not run with them into the same excess of dissipation, and they speak evil of you:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">But they shall give an account to him who is ready to judge the living and the dead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">For this reason the gospel was also preached to those who are dead, that though judged in the flesh as men, they might live according to God in the spirit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">But the end of all things is at hand: therefore be of sound mind and sober judgement for prayer.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Above all things have fervent love for one another: for love covers a multitude of sins.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Be hospitable to one another without grumbling.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">As every man has received a gift, so he should use it to serve one another, as befits good stewards of the manifold grace of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">If any man speak, let it be as one who speaks the oracles of God; if any man serves, let him do it as by the strength which God supplies: that in all things God may be glorified through Jesus Christ, to whom belong praise and dominion for ever and ever. Amen.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Beloved, do not be surprised at the fiery trial which comes upon you to test you, as though some strange thing was happened to you:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">But rejoice, insofar as you are partakers of Christ's sufferings; that, when his glory shall be revealed, you may be triumphantly joyful.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Blessed are you if you are insulted for the name of Christ; for the spirit of glory and of God rests upon you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">But let none of you suffer as a murderer, or as a thief, or as an evildoer, or as a meddler in other men's affairs.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Yet if any man suffers as a Christian, let him not be ashamed; but let him glorify God that he bears that name.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">For the time has come for judgment, which must begin with the household of God: and if it begins with us, what shall the end be for those who do not obey the gospel of God?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And if it is with difficulty that the righteous are saved, what shall become of the ungodly and the sinner?</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">Not being lords over those in your charge, but being examples to the flock.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And when the chief Shepherd shall appear, you shall receive a crown of glory that does not fade away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Likewise, you who are younger, submit yourselves to the elders. And all of you, clothe yourselves with humility toward one another: for God opposes the proud, but gives grace to the humble.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Therefore, humble yourselves under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in due time:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Casting all your anxiety upon him; for he cares for you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, like a roaring lion, walks about, seeking someone he may devour.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Resist him, steadfast in faith, knowing that the same experiences of suffering are required of your brethren who are throughout the world.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">But the God of all grace, who has called you to his eternal glory in Christ, after you have suffered a little while, will himself perfect, establish, strengthen, and settle you.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">Whose divine power has given to us all things that pertain to life and godliness, through the knowledge of him who has called us by his own glory and virtue:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">By which he has given to us exceedingly great and precious promises: that by these you might be partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">For this very reason, give all diligence to add to your faith virtue; and to virtue knowledge;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And to knowledge self-control; and to self-control perseverance; and to perseverance godliness;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And to godliness brotherly kindness; and to brotherly kindness love.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="9">But he who lacks these things is blind, and cannot see afar off, and has forgotten that he was purged from his old sins.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="15">Moreover, I will endeavour to see to it that after my departure you may be able at any time to recall these things.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="17">For he received from God the Father honour and glory, when there came a voice to him from the Majestic Glory, saying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And this voice which came from heaven we heard, when we were with him on the holy mountain.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And so we have the word of prophecy made more certain; to which you would do well to take heed, as to a light that shines in a dark place, until the day dawns, and the morning star arises in your hearts:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Knowing this first, that no prophecy of the scripture is a matter of one's private interpretation.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">And in greed they shall exploit you with false words: the judgment against them from of old does not linger, and their condemnation does not slumber.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="17">These are wells without water, mists driven before a tempest; for whom the blackest darkness is reserved.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">For they speak great swelling words of vanity, and allure through the lusts of the flesh, through sensuality, those who are just escaping from the ones who live in error.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">While they promise them liberty, they themselves are the slaves of depravity: for by that which a man is overcome, to that he is enslaved.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">For if, after they have escaped the defilements of the world through the knowledge of the Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, they are again entangled by them, and overcome, they are worse off in the end than at the beginning.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="4">And saying, Where is the promise of his coming? for ever since the fathers fell asleep, all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">For they willingly ignore this, that by the word of God the heavens existed long ago, and the earth was formed out of water and by water.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And by water the world that then was, being deluged, perished:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">But by the same word, the heavens and the earth which are now, are reserved for fire on the day of judgment and destruction of ungodly men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">But, beloved, do not be ignorant of this one thing, that with the Lord one day is like a thousand years, and a thousand years like one day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">The Lord is not slow concerning his promise, as some men count slowness; but is patient toward you, not wanting that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">But the day of the Lord will come as a thief; in which the heavens shall pass away with a roar, and the elements shall be destroyed with fervent heat, the earth and the works that are upon it shall be burned up.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="12">Looking for and hastening the coming of the day of God, in which the heavens shall be dissolved in fire, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">But we, according to his promise, look for new heavens and a new earth, in which righteousness dwells.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Therefore, beloved, seeing that you look for these things, be diligent that you may be found at peace with him, without spot, and blameless.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And consider the patience of our Lord to be salvation; just as our beloved brother Paul has written to you, according to the wisdom given to him,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Speaking of these things, as he does in all his letters. In them are some things that are hard to understand, which those who are unlearned and unstable distort, as they do the other scriptures, to their own destruction.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">But you, beloved, seeing that you know these things beforehand, beware lest you also, being led away by the error of the wicked, fall from your own steadfastness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">But grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. To him be glory both now and forever. Amen.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="17">And in the vision, this was how I saw the horses and those who sat upon them: they wore breastplates of fiery red, sapphire blue, and sulphur yellow: and the heads of the horses were like the heads of lions; and out of their mouths came fire and smoke and sulphur.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">By these three was a third of mankind killed, by the fire, and by the smoke, and by the sulphur, which came out of their mouths.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">For the power of the horses is in their mouths, and in their tails: for their tails were like serpents, and had heads, and with them they do harm.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And the rest of mankind, who were not killed by these plagues, still did not repent of the works of their hands; they did not stop worshipping devils, and idols of gold, and silver, and bronze, and stone, and wood: which can neither see, nor hear, nor walk:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Nor did they repent of their murders, or of their sorceries, or of their sexual immorality, or of their thefts.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">And I saw another mighty angel come down from heaven, clothed with a cloud: and a rainbow was upon his head, and his face was like the sun, and his feet like pillars of fire.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And he had open in his hand a little scroll: and he set his right foot upon the sea, and his left foot upon the earth,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And he cried out with a loud voice, as when a lion roars: and when he had cried out, the voices of seven thunders spoke.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And when the seven thunders had spoken, I was about to write: and I heard a voice from heaven saying to me, Seal up those things which the seven thunders spoke, and do not write them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And the angel, whom I saw standing upon the sea and upon the earth, lifted up his hand to heaven,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And swore by him who lives forever and ever, who created heaven, and the things that are in it, and the earth, and the things that are in it, and the sea, and the things that are in it, that there should be no more delay:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">But in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he is about to sound, the mystery of God will be fulfilled, as he has declared to his servants the prophets.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And the voice which I heard from heaven spoke to me again, and said, Go and take the little scroll which is open in the hand of the angel who stands upon the sea and upon the earth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And I went to the angel, and said to him, Give me the little scroll. And he said to me, Take, and eat it; it shall make your stomach bitter, but in your mouth it shall be sweet as honey.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And I took the little scroll out of the angel's hand, and ate it; and in my mouth it was sweet as honey: but as soon as I had eaten it, my stomach was made bitter.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="11">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And there was given to me a reed like a measuring rod: and I was told, Rise, and measure the temple of God, and the altar, and those who worship there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">But the court which is outside the temple leave out, and do not measure it; for it is given to the Gentiles: and they shall tread the holy city under foot for forty-two months.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And I will give power to my two witnesses, and they shall prophesy for a thousand two hundred and sixty days, clothed in sackcloth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">These are the two olive trees, and the two lampstands standing before the Lord of the earth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And if any man wants to harm them, fire proceeds out of their mouths, and devours their enemies: and if any man wants to harm them, he must in this manner be killed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">These two have power to shut up the sky, so that it does not rain during the days of their prophesying: and have power over the waters, to turn them to blood, and to strike the earth with all manner of plagues, as often as they desire.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And when they shall have finished their testimony, the beast that ascends out of the bottomless pit shall make war against them, and shall overcome them, and kill them.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="9">For three days and a half, men from the peoples and tribes and tongues and nations shall see their dead bodies, and shall not allow their dead bodies to be put in a tomb.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And those who live upon the earth shall rejoice over them, and make merry, and shall send gifts to one another; because these two prophets tormented those who dwell upon the earth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And after three days and a half the breath of life from God entered them, and they stood upon their feet; and great fear fell upon those who saw them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And they heard a great voice from heaven saying to them, Come up here. And they ascended to heaven in a cloud; and their enemies beheld them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And that hour there was a great earthquake, and a tenth of the city fell, and in the earthquake were slain seven thousand men: and the remnant were terrified, and gave glory to the God of heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">The second woe is past; behold, the third woe comes quickly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And the seventh angel sounded; and there were great voices in heaven, saying, The kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord, and of his Christ; and he shall reign forever and ever.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And the twenty-four elders, who sit before God on their thrones, fell upon their faces, and worshipped God,</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="12">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And there appeared a great sign in heaven; a woman clothed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and upon her head a crown of twelve stars:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And she was with child, and in the pains of birth cried out to be delivered.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And there appeared another sign in heaven; behold, a great red dragon, having seven heads and ten horns, and seven crowns upon his heads.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And his tail swept away a third of the stars of heaven, and cast them to the earth: and the dragon stood before the woman who was about to give birth, to devour her child as soon as it was born.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And she brought forth a male child, who is to rule all nations with a rod of iron: and her child was caught up to God, and to his throne.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And the woman fled into the wilderness, where she has a place prepared by God, in which she might be sustained for one thousand two hundred and sixty days.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And there was war in heaven: Michael and his angels fought against the dragon; and the dragon and his angels fought,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">But were not strong enough; and there was no longer any place for them in heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And the great dragon was cast down, that old serpent, called the Devil, and Satan, who deceives the whole world: he was cast down to the earth, and his angels were cast down with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And I heard a loud voice in heaven saying, Now salvation, and strength, and the kingdom of our God, and the authority of his Christ have come: for the accuser of our brethren has been cast down, who accuses them before our God day and night.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their testimony; and they did not love their lives to death.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Therefore rejoice, you heavens, and you who live in them. Woe to the inhabitants of the earth and of the sea! for the devil has come down to you, having great wrath, because he knows that he has but a short time.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And when the dragon saw that he had been cast down to the earth, he persecuted the woman who brought forth the male child.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And to the woman was given the two wings of a great eagle, that she might fly into the wilderness, to her place, where she would be sustained for a time, and times, and half a time, away from the face of the serpent.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And the serpent spewed out of his mouth water like a river after the woman, that he might cause her to be carried away by the flood.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And the earth helped the woman, and the ground opened its mouth, and swallowed up the flood which the dragon spewed out of his mouth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And the dragon was furious with the woman, and went to make war against the rest of her descendants, those who keep the commandments of God, and hold to the testimony of Jesus.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">And one of his heads seemed to have had a death-blow; but his deadly wound was healed: and all the world was astonished and followed after the beast.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And they worshipped the dragon, because he gave authority to the beast: and they worshipped the beast, saying, Who is like the beast? who is able to make war against him?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And there was given to him a mouth speaking proud words and blasphemies; and authority was given to him to act for forty-two months.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And he opened his mouth in blasphemy against God, to blaspheme his name, and his dwelling, and those who live in heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And it was given to him to make war on the saints, and to overcome them: and authority was given to him over every tribe, and people, and tongue, and nation.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="11">And I beheld another beast coming up out of the earth; and he had two horns like a lamb, and he spoke like a dragon.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="16">And he causes everyone, both small and great, rich and poor, free and slave, to receive a mark on his right hand, or on his forehead:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And no man might buy or sell, unless he had the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">This calls for wisdom. Let him who has understanding calculate the number of the beast, for it is the number of a man; and his number is six hundred and sixty-six.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">And I looked, and, lo, a Lamb stood on mount Zion, and with him a hundred and forty-four thousand, who had his name and his Father's name written on their foreheads.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="4">These are the ones who have not defiled themselves with women; for they are chaste. These are those who follow the Lamb wherever he goes. They were redeemed from among men, as first-fruits to God and to the Lamb.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Then one of the seven angels who had the seven bowls, came and spoke to me, saying, Come here; I will show you the judgment of the great harlot who sits upon many waters.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">With her the kings of the earth have committed acts of adultery, and the inhabitants of the earth have been made drunk with the wine of her adulteries.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">So he carried me away in the spirit into the wilderness: and I saw a woman sitting upon a scarlet coloured beast, which was full of names of blasphemy, and had seven heads and ten horns.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet, and decked with gold and precious stones and pearls, having a golden cup in her hand full of abominations and of the filthiness of her adulteries:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And upon her forehead was a name written, MYSTERY, BABYLON THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF HARLOTS AND OF THE ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And I saw the woman drunk with the blood of the saints, and with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus: and when I saw her, I wondered greatly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And the angel said to me, Why do you wonder? I will tell you the mystery of the woman, and of the beast that carries her, which has the seven heads and ten horns.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">The beast that you saw was, and is not; and shall ascend out of the bottomless pit, and go to perdition: and those who live on the earth whose names have not been written in the book of life from the foundation of the world, shall marvel when they behold the beast, because he was, and is not, and is to come.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">This calls for a mind with wisdom. The seven heads are seven mountains, on which the woman sits.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And there are seven kings: five have fallen, and one is, and the other has not yet come; and when he comes, he must remain for a short time.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="12">And the ten horns which you saw are ten kings, who have received no kingdom as yet; but receive authority as kings for one hour, along with the beast.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">These are of one mind, and shall give their power and authority to the beast.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">They shall make war against the Lamb, and the Lamb shall overcome them: for he is Lord of lords, and King of kings: and those who are with him are called, and chosen, and faithful.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And he said to me, The waters which you saw, where the harlot sits, are peoples, and multitudes, and nations, and tongues.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And the ten horns which you saw, and the beast, they shall hate the harlot, and shall make her desolate and naked, and shall eat her flesh, and burn her with fire.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">For God has put in their hearts to accomplish his purpose, by agreeing to give their sovereignty to the beast, until the words of God shall be fulfilled.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="17">For in one hour such great wealth has come to ruin. And every shipmaster, and all voyagers in ships, and sailors, and as many as make their living by the sea, stood far off,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And cried out when they saw the smoke of her burning, saying, What city was ever like this great city!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And they cast dust upon their heads, and cried, weeping and mourning, saying, Alas, alas, the great city, by which all who had ships on the sea were made rich by her wealth! for in one hour she has been laid waste.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">And after these things I heard the roar of a great multitude in heaven, saying, Alleluia; Salvation, and glory, and power belong to our God:</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="9">And he said to me, Write, Blessed are those who are invited to the marriage supper of the Lamb. And he said to me, These are the true words of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And I fell at his feet to worship him. And he said to me, Do not do that: I am a fellow servant with you and your brethren, who hold to the testimony of Jesus: worship God: for the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="16">And he has on his robe and on his thigh a name written, KING OF KINGS, AND LORD OF LORDS.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And I saw an angel standing in the sun; and he cried out with a loud voice, saying to all the birds that fly in mid-heaven, Come and gather yourselves together for the great supper of God;</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="20">And the beast was seized, and with him the false prophet who performed miraculous signs in his presence, with which he deceived those who had received the mark of the beast, and those who worshipped his image. They were both cast alive into the lake of fire that burns with sulphur.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And the rest were slain with the sword that came out of the mouth of him who sat upon the horse: and all the birds were filled with their flesh.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">And cast him into the bottomless pit, and shut him up, and sealed it over him, that he should no longer deceive the nations, until the thousand years should be ended: and after that he must be released for a short time.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And I saw thrones, on which were seated those to whom judgment had been given: and I saw the souls of those who had been beheaded for their witness for Jesus, and for the word of God, and who had not worshipped the beast, nor his image, nor had they received his mark upon their foreheads, or on their hands; and they lived again and reigned with Christ for a thousand years.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">But the rest of the dead did not come to life again until the thousand years were ended. This is the first resurrection.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Blessed and holy is he who takes part in the first resurrection: over these the second death has no power, but they shall be priests of God and of Christ, and shall reign with him for a thousand years.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="8">But the cowardly, and unbelieving, and the vile, and murderers, and the sexually immoral, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burns with fire and sulphur: which is the second death.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And there came to me one of the seven angels who had the seven bowls full of the seven last plagues, and spoke to me, saying, Come here, I will show you the bride, the wife of the Lamb.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And he carried me away in the spirit to a great and high mountain, and showed me the holy city, Jerusalem, descending out of heaven from God,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Having the glory of God: and her radiance was like a stone most precious, like a jasper, clear as crystal.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">It had a great and high wall, and twelve gates, and at the gates twelve angels, and on the gates were written the names of the twelve tribes of the sons of Israel.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="15">And he who spoke to me had a measuring rod of gold to measure the city, and its gates, and its wall.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And the city was laid out in a square, its length equal to its breadth: and he measured the city with the rod, twelve thousand stadia. The length and the breadth and the height of it are equal.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And he measured its wall, a hundred and forty-four cubits, according to man's measurement, which the angel was using.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And the wall was made of jasper: and the city of pure gold, like clear glass.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="22">And I saw no temple in it: for the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are its temple.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And the city had no need of the sun, or the moon, to shine upon it: for the glory of God is its light, and the Lamb its lamp.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="25">And its gates shall never be shut by day: and there shall be no night there.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="22">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And he showed me the river of the water of life, clear as crystal, flowing from the throne of God and of the Lamb,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Down the middle of the street of the city. And on either side of the river was the tree of life, which bore twelve kinds of fruits, and yielded its fruit every month: and the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And there shall no longer be any curse: but the throne of God and of the Lamb shall be in it; and his servants shall serve him:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And they shall see his face; and his name shall be upon their foreheads.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="9">Then he said to me, Do not do that: I am a fellow servant with you and your brethren the prophets, and with those who keep the words of this book: worship God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And he said to me, Do not seal up the words of the prophecy of this book: for the time is at hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">He who is unjust, let him be unjust still: and he who is filthy, let him be filthy still: and he who is righteous, let him be righteous still: and he who is holy, let him be holy still.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Behold, I am coming quickly; and my reward is with me, to give to every man according to what he has done.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="14">Blessed are those who wash their robes, that they may have the right to the tree of life, and may enter through the gates into the city.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Outside are dogs, and sorcerers, and the sexually immoral, and murderers, and idolaters, and everyone who loves and practices falsehood.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">I, Jesus, have sent my angel to you to testify of these things for the churches. I am the root and the offspring of David, the bright morning star.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And the Spirit and the bride say, Come. And let him who hears say, Come. And let him who is thirsty come. And whoever will, let him take the water of life without cost.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">For I testify to every man who hears the words of the prophecy of this book, If any man shall add to these things, God shall add to him the plagues that are written in this book:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part in the tree of life, and in the holy city, which are described in this book.</VERS>
