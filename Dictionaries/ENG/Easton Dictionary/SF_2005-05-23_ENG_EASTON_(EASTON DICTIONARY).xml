    <description>These Dictionary topics are from M.G. Easton M.A., D.D., Illustrated Bible Dictionary, Third Edition, published by Thomas Nelson, 1897. Due to the nature of etext, the illustrated portions of the Dictionary have not been included.
		The current format has been designed for programatic reference, placing 50 topics in a file, preceeding each topic with $$topic_number, surrounding the topic name with back-slashes, References to other topics are prefixed with a  (ascii 175) double arrow followed by the 8 byte topic number. It should be noted that it is possible to have the topic prefix followed by "(n/a)". This is due to a very small number of topic references which were unable to be resolved. These topics are: 
        Laadan, Land Laws, Vashni.
        These topics are not listed in the printed edition and it is not apparent what Mr. Easton intended.  The verse references have not been marked up or tagged for program usage.  It is hoped someone will do this work and make the resulting files available to the person(s) below.

    <description>Alpha, the first letter of the Greek alphabet, as Omega is the last. These letters occur in the text of Rev. 1:8,11; 21:6; 22:13, and are represented by "Alpha" and "Omega" respectively (omitted in R.V., 1:11). They mean "the first and last." (<reflink target="XXX">Comp. Heb. 12:2; Isa. 41:4; 44:6; Rev. 1:11,17; 2:8.</reflink>) In the symbols of the early Christian Church these two letters are frequently combined with the cross or with Christ's monogram to denote his divinity.</description>

  <item id="Aaron">
    <description>the eldest son of Amram and Jochebed, a daughter of Levi (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 6:20</reflink>). Some explain the name as meaning mountaineer, others mountain of strength, illuminator. He was born in Egypt three years before his brother Moses, and a number of years after his sister Miriam (2:1,4; 7:7). He married Elisheba, the daughter of Amminadab of the house of Judah (6:23; 1 Chr. 2:10), by whom he had four sons, Nadab and Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar. When the time for the deliverance of Isarael out of Egypt drew nigh, he was sent by God (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 4:14,27-30</reflink>) to meet his long-absent brother, that he might co-operate with him in all that they were required to do in bringing about the Exodus. He was to be the "mouth" or "prophet" of Moses, i.e., was to speak for him, because he was a man of a ready utterance (7:1,2,9,10,19). He was faithful to his trust, and stood by Moses in all his interviews with Pharaoh.</description>
    <description>When the ransomed tribes fought their first battle with Amalek in Rephidim, Moses stood on a hill overlooking the scene of the conflict with the rod of God in his outstretched hand. On this occasion he was attended by Aaron and Hur, his sister's husband, who held up his wearied hands till Joshua and the chosen warriors of Israel gained the victory (17:8-13).</description>
    <description>Afterwards, when encamped before Sinai, and when Moses at the command of God ascended the mount to receive the tables of the law, Aaron and his two sons, Nadab and Abihu, along with seventy of the elders of Israel, were permitted to accompany him part of the way, and to behold afar off the manifestation of the glory of Israel's God (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 19:24; 24:9-11</reflink>). While Moses remained on the mountain with God, Aaron returned unto the people; and yielding through fear, or ignorance, or instability of character, to their clamour, made unto them a golden calf, and set it up as an object of worship (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 32:4; Ps. 106:19</reflink>). On the return of Moses to the camp, Aaron was sternly rebuked by him for the part he had acted in this matter; but he interceded for him before God, who forgave his sin (<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 9:20</reflink>).</description>
    <description>On the mount, Moses received instructions regarding the system of worship which was to be set up among the people; and in accordance therewith Aaron and his sons were consecrated to the priest's office (Lev. 8; 9). Aaron, as high priest, held henceforth the prominent place appertaining to that office.</description>
    <description>When Israel had reached Hazeroth, in "the wilderness of Paran," Aaron joined with his sister Miriam in murmuring against Moses, "because of the Ethiopian woman whom he had married," probably after the death of Zipporah. But the Lord vindicated his servant Moses, and punished Miriam with leprosy (Num. 12). Aaron acknowledged his own and his sister's guilt, and at the intercession of Moses they were forgiven.</description>
    <description>Twenty years after this, when the children of Israel were encamped in the wilderness of Paran, Korah, Dathan, and Abiram conspired against Aaron and his sons; but a fearful judgment from God fell upon them, and they were destroyed, and the next day thousands of the people also perished by a fierce pestilence, the ravages of which were only stayed by the interposition of Aaron (Num. 16). That there might be further evidence of the divine appointment of Aaron to the priestly office, the chiefs of the tribes were each required to bring to Moses a rod bearing on it the name of his tribe. And these, along with the rod of Aaron for the tribe of Levi, were laid up overnight in the tabernacle, and in the morning it was found that while the other rods remained unchanged, that of Aaron "for the house of Levi" budded, blossomed, and yielded almonds (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 17:1-10</reflink>). This rod was afterwards preserved in the tabernacle (<reflink target="XXX">Heb. 9:4</reflink>) as a memorial of the divine attestation of his appointment to the priesthood.</description>
    <description>Aaron was implicated in the sin of his brother at Meribah (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 20:8-13</reflink>), and on that account was not permitted to enter the Promised Land. When the tribes arrived at Mount Hor, "in the edge of the land of Edom," at the command of God Moses led Aaron and his son Eleazar to the top of that mountain, in the sight of all the people. There he stripped Aaron of his priestly vestments, and put them upon Eleazar; and there Aaron died on the top of the mount, being 123 years old (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 20:23-29. Comp. Deut. 10:6; 32:50</reflink>), and was "gathered unto his people." The people, "even all the house of Israel," mourned for him thirty days. Of Aaron's sons two survived him, Eleazar, whose family held the high-priesthood till the time of Eli; and Ithamar, in whose family, beginning with Eli, the high-priesthood was held till the time of Solomon. Aaron's other two sons had been struck dead (<reflink target="XXX">Lev. 10:1,2</reflink>) for the daring impiety of offering "strange fire" on the alter of incense.</description>
    <description>The Arabs still show with veneration the traditionary site of Aaron's grave on one of the two summits of Mount Hor, which is marked by a Mohammedan chapel. His name is mentioned in the Koran, and there are found in the writings of the rabbins many fabulous stories regarding him.</description>
    <description>He was the first anointed priest. His descendants, "the house of Aaron," constituted the priesthood in general. In the time of David they were very numerous (<reflink target="XXX">1 Chr. 12:27</reflink>). The other branches of the tribe of Levi held subordinate positions in connection with the sacred office. Aaron was a type of Christ in his official character as the high priest. His priesthood was a "shadow of heavenly things," and was intended to lead the people of Israel to look forward to the time when "another priest" would arise "after the order of Melchizedek" (<reflink target="XXX">Heb. 6:20</reflink>). (<see target="x-self">See MOSES.</see>)</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Aaronites">
    <description>the descendants of Aaron, and therefore priests. Jehoiada, the father of Benaiah, led 3,700 Aaronites as "fighting men" to the support of David at Hebron (<reflink target="XXX">1 Chr. 12:27</reflink>). Eleazar (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 3:32</reflink>), and at a later period Zadok (<reflink target="XXX">1 Chr. 27:17</reflink>), was their chief.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Abaddon">
    <description>destruction, the Hebrew name (equivalent to the Greek Apollyon, i.e., destroyer) of "the angel of the bottomless pit" (<reflink target="XXX">Rev. 9:11</reflink>). It is rendered "destruction" in Job 28:22; 31:12; 26:6; Prov. 15:11; 27:20. In the last three of these passages the Revised Version retains the word "Abaddon." We may regard this word as a personification of the idea of destruction, or as sheol, the realm of the dead.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Abagtha">
    <description>one of the seven eunuchs in Ahasuerus's court (<reflink target="XXX">Esther 1:10; 2:21</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Abana">
    <description>stony (Heb. marg. "Amanah," perennial), the chief river of Damascus (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 5:12</reflink>). Its modern name is Barada, the Chrysorrhoas, or "golden stream," of the Greeks. It rises in a cleft of the Anti-Lebanon range, about 23 miles north-west of Damascus, and after flowing southward for a little way parts into three smaller streams, the central one flowing through Damascus, and the other two on each side of the city, diffusing beauty and fertility where otherwise there would be barrenness.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Abarim">
    <description>regions beyond; i.e., on the east of Jordan, a mountain, or rather a mountain-chain, over against Jericho, to the east and south-east of the Dead Sea, in the land of Moab. From "the top of Pisgah", i.e., Mount Nebo (q.v.), one of its summits, Moses surveyed the Promised Land (<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 3:27; 32:49</reflink>), and there he died (34:1,5). The Israelites had one of their encampments in the mountains of Abarim (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 33:47,48</reflink>) after crossing the Arnon.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Abba">
    <description>This Syriac or Chaldee word is found three times in the New Testament (<reflink target="XXX">Mark 14:36; Rom. 8:15; Gal. 4:6</reflink>), and in each case is followed by its Greek equivalent, which is translated "father." It is a term expressing warm affection and filial confidence. It has no perfect equivalent in our language. It has passed into European languages as an ecclesiastical term, "abbot."</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Abda">
    <description>servant. (1.) The father of Adoniram, whom Solomon set over the tribute (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 4:6</reflink>); i.e., the forced labour (R.V., "levy").</description>
    <description>(2.) A Levite of the family of Jeduthun (<reflink target="XXX">Neh. 11:17</reflink>), also called Obadiah (<reflink target="XXX">1 Chr. 9:16</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Abdeel">
    <description>servant of God, (<reflink target="XXX">Jer. 36:26</reflink>), the father of Shelemiah.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Abdi">
    <description>my servant. (1.) 1 Chr. 6:44. (2.) 2 Chr. 29:12. (3.) Ezra 10:26.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Abdiel">
    <description>servant of God, (<reflink target="XXX">1 Chr. 5:15</reflink>), a Gadite chief.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Abdon">
    <description>servile. (1.) The son of Hillel, a Pirathonite, the tenth judge of Israel (<reflink target="XXX">Judg. 12:13-15</reflink>). He is probably the Bedan of 1 Sam. 12:11.</description>
    <description>(2.) The first-born of Gibeon of the tribe of Benjamin (<reflink target="XXX">1 Chr. 8:30; 9:36</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(3.) The son of Micah, one of those whom Josiah sent to the prophetess Huldah to ascertain from her the meaning of the recently discovered book of the law (<reflink target="XXX">2 Chr. 34:20</reflink>). He is called Achbor in 2 Kings 22:12.</description>
    <description>(4.) One of the "sons" of Shashak (<reflink target="XXX">1 Chr. 8:23</reflink>).</description>
    <description>This is the name also of a Levitical town of the Gershonites, in the tribe of Asher (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 21:30; 1 Chr. 6:74</reflink>). The ruins of Abdeh, some 8 miles north-east of Accho, probably mark its site.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Abednego">
    <description>servant of Nego=Nebo, the Chaldee name given to Azariah, one of Daniel's three companions (<reflink target="XXX">Dan. 2:49</reflink>). With Shadrach and Meshach, he was delivered from the burning fiery furnace (3:12-30).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Abel">
    <description>(Heb. Hebhel), a breath, or vanity, the second son of Adam and Eve. He was put to death by his brother Cain (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 4:1-16</reflink>). Guided by the instruction of their father, the two brothers were trained in the duty of worshipping God. "And in process of time" (marg. "at the end of days", i.e., on the Sabbath) each of them offered up to God of the first-fruits of his labours. Cain, as a husbandman, offered the fruits of the field; Abel, as a shepherd, of the firstlings of his flock. "The Lord had respect unto Abel and his offering; but unto Cain and his offering he had not respect" (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 4:3-5</reflink>). On this account Cain was angry with his brother, and formed the design of putting him to death; a design which he at length found an opportunity of carrying into effect (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 4:8,9. Comp. 1 John 3:12</reflink>). There are several references to Abel in the New Testament. Our Saviour speaks of him as "righteous" (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 23:35</reflink>). "The blood of sprinkling" is said to speak "better things than that of Abel" (<reflink target="XXX">Heb. 12:24</reflink>); i.e., the blood of Jesus is the reality of which the blood of the offering made by Abel was only the type. The comparison here is between the sacrifice offered by Christ and that offered by Abel, and not between the blood of Christ calling for mercy and the blood of the murdered Abel calling for vengeance, as has sometimes been supposed. It is also said (<reflink target="XXX">Heb. 11:4</reflink>) that "Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain." This sacrifice was made "by faith;" this faith rested in God, not only as the Creator and the God of providence, but especially in God as the great Redeemer, whose sacrifice was typified by the sacrifices which, no doubt by the divine institution, were offered from the days of Adam downward. On account of that "faith" which looked forward to the great atoning sacrifice, Abel's offering was accepted of God. Cain's offering had no such reference, and therefore was rejected. Abel was the first martyr, as he was the first of our race to die.</description>
    <description>Abel (Heb. 'abhel), lamentation (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 6:18</reflink>), the name given to the great stone in Joshua's field whereon the ark was "set down." The Revised Version, however, following the Targum and the LXX., reads in the Hebrew text _'ebhen_ (= a stone), and accordingly translates "unto the great stone, whereon they set down the ark." This reading is to be preferred.</description>
    <description>Abel (Heb. 'abhel), a grassy place, a meadow. This word enters into the composition of the following words:</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Abel-beth-maachah">
    <description>meadow of the house of Maachah, a city in the north of Palestine, in the neighbourhood of Dan and Ijon, in the tribe of Naphtali. It was a place of considerable strength and importance. It is called a "mother in Israel", i.e., a metropolis (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 20:19</reflink>). It was besieged by Joab (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 20:14</reflink>), by Benhadad (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 15:20</reflink>), and by Tiglath-pileser (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 15:29</reflink>) about B.C. 734. It is elsewhere called Abel-maim, meadow of the waters, (<reflink target="XXX">2 Chr. 16:4</reflink>). Its site is occupied by the modern Abil or Abil-el-kamh, on a rising ground to the east of the brook Derdarah, which flows through the plain of Huleh into the Jordan, about 6 miles to the west-north-west of Dan.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Abel-cheramim">
    <description>(<reflink target="XXX">Judg. 11:33, R.V.; A. V., "plain of the vineyards"</reflink>), a village of the Ammonites, whither Jephthah pursued their forces.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Abel-meholah">
    <description>meadow of dancing, or the dancing-meadow, the birth-place and residence of the prophet Elisha, not far from Beth-shean (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 4:12</reflink>), in the tribe of Issachar, near where the Wady el-Maleh emerges into the valley of the Jordan, "the rich meadow-land which extends about 4 miles south of Beth-shean; moist and luxuriant." Here Elisha was found at his plough by Elijah on his return up the Jordan valley from Horeb (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 19:16</reflink>). It is now called 'Ain Helweh.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Abel-mizraim">
    <description>meadow of Egypt, or mourning of Egypt, a place "beyond," i.e., on the west of Jordan, at the "threshing-floor of Atad." Here the Egyptians mourned seventy days for Jacob (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 50:4-11</reflink>). Its site is unknown.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Abel-shittim">
    <description>meadow of the acacias, frequently called simply "Shittim" (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 25:1; Josh. 2:1; Micah 6:5</reflink>), a place on the east of Jordan, in the plain of Moab, nearly opposite Jericho. It was the forty-second encampment of the Israelites, their last resting-place before they crossed the Jordan (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 33:49; 22:1; 26:3; 31:12; comp. 25:1; 31:16</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Abez">
    <description>tin, or white, a town in the tribe of Issachar (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 19:20</reflink>), at the north of the plain of Esdraelon. It is probably identified with the ruins of el-Beida.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Abi-albon">
    <description>father of strength; i.e., "valiant", one of David's body-guard of thirty mighty men (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 23:31</reflink>); called also Abiel (<reflink target="XXX">1 Chr. 11:32</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Abia">
    <description>my father is the Lord, the Greek form of Abijah, or Abijam (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 1:7</reflink>), instead of Abiah (<reflink target="XXX">1 Chr. 7:8</reflink>). In Luke 1:5, the name refers to the head of the eighth of the twenty-four courses into which David divided the priests (<reflink target="XXX">1 Chr. 24:10</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Abiasaph">
    <description>father of gathering; the gatherer, the youngest of the three sons of Korah the Levite, head of a family of Korhites (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 6:24</reflink>); called Ebisaph (<reflink target="XXX">1 Chr. 6:37</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Abiathar">
    <description>father of abundance, or my father excels, the son of Ahimelech the high priest. He was the tenth high priest, and the fourth in descent from Eli. When his father was slain with the priests of Nob, he escaped, and bearing with him the ephod, he joined David, who was then in the cave of Adullam (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 22:20-23; 23:6</reflink>). He remained with David, and became priest of the party of which he was the leader (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 30:7</reflink>). When David ascended the throne of Judah, Abiathar was appointed high priest (<reflink target="XXX">1 Chr. 15:11; 1 Kings 2:26</reflink>) and the "king's companion" (<reflink target="XXX">1 Chr. 27:34</reflink>). Meanwhile Zadok, of the house of Eleazar, had been made high priest. These appointments continued in force till the end of David's reign (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 4:4</reflink>). Abiathar was deposed (the sole historical instance of the deposition of a high priest) and banished to his home at Anathoth by Solomon, because he took part in the attempt to raise Adonijah to the throne. The priesthood thus passed from the house of Ithamar (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 2:30-36; 1 Kings 1:19; 2:26, 27</reflink>). Zadok now became sole high priest. In Mark 2:26, reference is made to an occurrence in "the days of Abiathar the high priest." But from 1 Sam. 22, we learn explicitly that this event took place when Ahimelech, the father of Abiathar, was high priest. The apparent discrepancy is satisfactorily explained by interpreting the words in Mark as referring to the life-time of Abiathar, and not to the term of his holding the office of high priest. It is not implied in Mark that he was actual high priest at the time referred to. Others, however, think that the loaves belonged to Abiathar, who was at that time (<reflink target="XXX">Lev. 24:9</reflink>) a priest, and that he either himself gave them to David, or persuaded his father to give them.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Abib">
    <description>an ear of corn, the month of newly-ripened grain (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 13:4; 23:15</reflink>); the first of the Jewish ecclesiastical year, and the seventh of the civil year. It began about the time of the vernal equinox, on 21st March. It was called Nisan, after the Captivity (<reflink target="XXX">Neh. 2:1</reflink>). On the fifteenth day of the month, harvest was begun by gathering a sheaf of barley, which was offered unto the Lord on the sixteenth (<reflink target="XXX">Lev. 23:4-11</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Abida">
    <description>or Abi'dah, father of knowledge; knowing, one of the five sons of Midian, who was the son of Abraham by Keturah (<reflink target="XXX">1 Chr. 1:33</reflink>), and apparently the chief of an Arab tribe.</description>

He was the grandson of Manasseh (<reflink target="XXX">1 Chr. 7:18</reflink>). From his family Gideon sprang (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 17:2; comp. Judg. 6:34; 8:2</reflink>). He was also called Jeezer (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 26:30</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(2.) One of David's thirty warriors (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 23:27; comp. 1 Chr. 27:12</reflink>).</description>

Along with his three brothers he was consecrated to the priest's office (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 28:1</reflink>). With his father and elder brother he accompanied the seventy elders part of the way up the mount with Moses (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 24:1,9</reflink>). On one occasion he and Nadab his brother offered incense in their censers filled with "strange" (i.e., common) fire, i.e., not with fire taken from the great brazen altar (<reflink target="XXX">Lev. 6:9, etc.</reflink>), and for this offence they were struck dead, and were taken out and buried without the camp (<reflink target="XXX">Lev. 10:1-11; comp. Num. 3:4; 26:61; 1 Chr. 24:2</reflink>). It is probable that when they committed this offence they were intoxicated, for immediately after is given the law prohibiting the use of wine or strong drink to the priests.</description>

  <item id="Abihud">
    <description>father (i.e., "possessor") of renown. (1.) One of the sons of Bela, the son of Benjamin (<reflink target="XXX">1 Chr. 8:3</reflink>); called also Ahihud (ver. 7).</description>
    <description>(2.) A descendant of Zerubbabel and father of Eliakim (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 1:13, "Abiud"</reflink>); called also Juda (<reflink target="XXX">Luke 3:26</reflink>), and Obadiah (<reflink target="XXX">1 Chr. 3:21</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Abijah">
    <description>father (i.e., "possessor or worshipper") of Jehovah. (1.) 1 Chr. 7:8. (2.) 1 Chr. 2:24.</description>
    <description>(3.) The second son of Samuel (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 8:2; 1 Chr. 6:28</reflink>). His conduct, along with that of his brother, as a judge in Beer-sheba, to which office his father had appointed him, led to popular discontent, and ultimately provoked the people to demand a royal form of government.</description>
    <description>(4.) A descendant of Eleazar, the son of Aaron, a chief of one of the twenty-four orders into which the priesthood was divided by David (<reflink target="XXX">1 Chr. 24:10</reflink>). The order of Abijah was one of those which did not return from the Captivity (<reflink target="XXX">Ezra 2:36-39; Neh. 7:39-42; 12:1</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(5.) The son of Rehoboam, whom he succeeded on the throne of Judah (<reflink target="XXX">1 Chr. 3:10</reflink>). He is also called Abijam (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 14:31; 15:1-8</reflink>). He began his three years' reign (<reflink target="XXX">2 Chr. 12:16; 13:1,2</reflink>) with a strenuous but unsuccessful effort to bring back the ten tribes to their allegiance. His address to "Jeroboam and all Israel," before encountering them in battle, is worthy of being specially noticed (<reflink target="XXX">2 Chr. 13:5-12</reflink>). It was a very bloody battle, no fewer than 500,000 of the army of Israel having perished on the field. He is described as having walked "in all the sins of his father" (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 15:3; 2 Chr. 11:20-22</reflink>). It is said in 1 Kings 15:2 that "his mother's name was Maachah, the daughter of Abishalom;" but in 2 Chr. 13:2 we read, "his mother's name was Michaiah, the daughter of Uriel of Gibeah." The explanation is that Maachah is just a variation of the name Michaiah, and that Abishalom is probably the same as Absalom, the son of David. It is probable that "Uriel of Gibeah" married Tamar, the daughter of Absalom (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 14:27</reflink>), and by her had Maachah. The word "daughter" in 1 Kings 15:2 will thus, as it frequently elsewhere does, mean grand-daughter.</description>
    <description>(6.) A son of Jeroboam, the first king of Israel. On account of his severe illness when a youth, his father sent his wife to consult the prophet Ahijah regarding his recovery. The prophet, though blind with old age, knew the wife of Jeroboam as soon as she approached, and under a divine impulse he announced to her that inasmuch as in Abijah alone of all the house of Jeroboam there was found "some good thing toward the Lord," he only would come to his grave in peace. As his mother crossed the threshold of the door on her return, the youth died, and "all Israel mourned for him" (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 14:1-18</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(7.) The daughter of Zechariah (<reflink target="XXX">2 Chr. 29:1; comp. Isa. 8:2</reflink>), and afterwards the wife of Ahaz. She is also called Abi (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 18:2</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(8.) One of the sons of Becher, the son of Benjamin (<reflink target="XXX">1 Chr. 7:8</reflink>). "Abiah," A.V.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Abijam">
    <description>father of the sea; i.e., "seaman" the name always used in Kings of the king of Judah, the son of Rehoboam, elsewhere called Abijah (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 15:1,7,8</reflink>). (<see target="x-self">See ABIJAH, 5.</see>)</description>

  <item id="Abilene">
    <description>a plain, a district lying on the east slope of the Anti-Lebanon range; so called from its chief town, Abila (<reflink target="XXX">Luke 3:1</reflink>), which stood in the Suk Wady Barada, between Heliopolis (Baalbec) and Damascus, 38 miles from the former and 18 from the latter. Lysanias was governor or tetrarch of this province.</description>

  <item id="Abimelech">
    <description>my father a king, or father of a king, a common name of the Philistine kings, as "Pharaoh" was of the Egyptian kings. (1.) The Philistine king of Gerar in the time of Abraham (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 20:1-18</reflink>). By an interposition of Providence, Sarah was delivered from his harem, and was restored to her husband Abraham. As a mark of respect he gave to Abraham valuable gifts, and offered him a settlement in any part of his country; while at the same time he delicately and yet severely rebuked him for having practised a deception upon him in pretending that Sarah was only his sister. Among the gifts presented by the king were a thousand pieces of silver as a "covering of the eyes" for Sarah; i.e., either as an atoning gift and a testimony of her innocence in the sight of all, or rather for the purpose of procuring a veil for Sarah to conceal her beauty, and thus as a reproof to her for not having worn a veil which, as a married woman, she ought to have done. A few years after this Abimelech visited Abraham, who had removed southward beyond his territory, and there entered into a league of peace and friendship with him. This league was the first of which we have any record. It was confirmed by a mutual oath at Beer-sheba (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 21:22-34</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(2.) A king of Gerar in the time of Isaac, probably the son of the preceeding (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 26:1-22</reflink>). Isaac sought refuge in his territory during a famine, and there he acted a part with reference to his wife Rebekah similar to that of his father Abraham with reference to Sarah. Abimelech rebuked him for the deception, which he accidentally discovered. Isaac settled for a while here, and prospered. Abimelech desired him, however, to leave his territory, which Isaac did. Abimelech afterwards visited him when he was encamped at Beer-sheba, and expressed a desire to renew the covenant which had been entered into between their fathers (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 26:26-31</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(3.) A son of Gideon (<reflink target="XXX">Judg. 9:1</reflink>), who was proclaimed king after the death of his father (<reflink target="XXX">Judg. 8:33-9:6</reflink>). One of his first acts was to murder his brothers, seventy in number, "on one stone," at Ophrah. Only one named Jotham escaped. He was an unprincipled, ambitious ruler, often engaged in war with his own subjects. When engaged in reducing the town of Thebez, which had revolted, he was struck mortally on his head by a mill-stone, thrown by the hand of a woman from the wall above. Perceiving that the wound was mortal, he desired his armour-bearer to thrust him through with his sword, that it might not be said he had perished by the hand of a woman (<reflink target="XXX">Judg. 9:50-57</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(4.) The son of Abiathar, and high priest in the time of David (<reflink target="XXX">1 Chr. 18:16</reflink>). In the parallel passage, 2 Sam. 8:17, we have the name Ahimelech, and Abiathar, the son of Ahimelech. This most authorities consider the more correct reading. (5.) Achish, king of Gath, in the title of Ps. 34. (Comp. 1 Sam. 21:10-15.)</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Abinadab">
    <description>father of nobleness; i.e., "noble." (1.) A Levite of Kirjath-jearim, in whose house the ark of the covenant was deposited after having been brought back from the land of the Philistines (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 7:1</reflink>). It remained there twenty years, till it was at length removed by David (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 7:1,2; 1 Chr. 13:7</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(2.) The second of the eight sons of Jesse (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 16:8</reflink>). He was with Saul in the campaign against the Philistines in which Goliath was slain (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 17:13</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(3.) One of Saul's sons, who peristed with his father in the battle of Gilboa (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 31:2; 1 Chr. 10:2</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(4.) One of Solomon's officers, who "provided victuals for the king and his household." He presided, for this purpose, over the district of Dor (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 4:11</reflink>).</description>

  <item id="Abiram">
    <description>father of height; i.e., "proud." (1.) One of the sons of Eliab, who joined Korah in the conspiracy against Moses and Aaron. He and all the conspirators, with their families and possessions (except the children of Korah), were swallowed up by an earthquake (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 16:1-27; 26:9; Ps. 106:17</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(2.) The eldest son of Hiel the Bethelite, who perished prematurely in consequence of his father's undertaking to rebuild Jericho (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 16:34</reflink>), according to the words of Joshua (6:26). (<see target="x-self">See JERICHO.</see>)</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Abishag">
    <description>father of (i.e., "given to") error, a young woman of Shunem, distinguished for her beauty. She was chosen to minister to David in his old age. She became his wife (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 1:3,4,15</reflink>). After David's death Adonijah persuaded Bathsheba, Solomon's mother, to entreat the king to permit him to marry Abishag. Solomon suspected in this request an aspiration to the throne, and therefore caused him to be put to death (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 2:17-25</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Abishai">
    <description>father of (i.e., "desirous of") a gift, the eldest son of Zeruiah, David's sister. He was the brother of Joab and Asahel (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 2:18; 1 Chr. 2:16</reflink>). Abishai was the only one who accompanied David when he went to the camp of Saul and took the spear and the cruse of water from Saul's bolster (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 26:5-12</reflink>). He had the command of one of the three divisions of David's army at the battle with Absalom (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 18:2,5,12</reflink>). He slew the Philistine giant Ishbi-benob, who threatened David's life (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 21:15-17</reflink>). He was the chief of the second rank of the three "mighties" (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 23:18, 19; 1 Chr. 11:20,21</reflink>); and on one occasion withstood 300 men, and slew them with his own spear (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 23:18</reflink>). Abishai is the name of the Semitic chief who offers gifts to the lord of Beni-Hassan. See illustration facing page 10.</description>

    <description>(<reflink target="XXX">Ps. 35:15</reflink>), the translation of a Hebrew word meaning smiters; probably, in allusion to the tongue, slanderers. (<reflink target="XXX">Comp. Jer. 18:18.</reflink>)</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Ablution">
    <description>or washing, was practised, (1.) When a person was initiated into a higher state: e.g., when Aaron and his sons were set apart to the priest's office, they were washed with water previous to their investiture with the priestly robes (<reflink target="XXX">Lev. 8:6</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(2.) Before the priests approached the altar of God, they were required, on pain of death, to wash their hands and their feet to cleanse them from the soil of common life (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 30:17-21</reflink>). To this practice the Psalmist alludes, Ps. 26:6.</description>
    <description>(3.) There were washings prescribed for the purpose of cleansing from positive defilement contracted by particular acts. Of such washings eleven different species are prescribed in the Levitical law (Lev. 12-15).</description>
    <description>(4.) A fourth class of ablutions is mentioned, by which a person purified or absolved himself from the guilt of some particular act. For example, the elders of the nearest village where some murder was committed were required, when the murderer was unknown, to wash their hands over the expiatory heifer which was beheaded, and in doing so to say, "Our hands have not shed this blood, neither have our eyes seen it" (<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 21:1-9</reflink>). So also Pilate declared himself innocent of the blood of Jesus by washing his hands (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 27:24</reflink>). This act of Pilate may not, however, have been borrowed from the custom of the Jews. The same practice was common among the Greeks and Romans.</description>
    <description>The Pharisees carried the practice of ablution to great excess, thereby claiming extraordinary purity (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 23:25</reflink>). Mark (7:1-5) refers to the ceremonial ablutions. The Pharisees washed their hands "oft," more correctly, "with the fist" (R.V., "diligently"), or as an old father, Theophylact, explains it, "up to the elbow." (<reflink target="XXX">Compare also Mark 7:4; Lev. 6:28; 11: 32-36; 15:22</reflink>) (<see target="x-self">See WASHING.</see>)</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Abner">
    <description>father of light; i.e., "enlightening", the son of Ner and uncle of Saul. He was commander-in-chief of Saul's army (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 14:50; 17:55; 20:25</reflink>). He first introduced David to the court of Saul after the victory over Goliath (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 17:57</reflink>). After the death of Saul, David was made king over Judah, and reigned in Hebron. Among the other tribes there was a feeling of hostility to Judah; and Abner, at the head of Ephraim, fostered this hostility in the interest of the house of Saul, whose son Ish-bosheth he caused to be proclaimed king (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 2:8</reflink>). A state of war existed between these two kings. A battle fatal to Abner, who was the leader of Ish-boseth's army, was fought with David's army under Joab at Gibeon (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 2:12</reflink>). Abner, escaping from the field, was overtaken by Asahel, who was "light of foot as a wild roe," the brother of Joab and Abishai, whom he thrust through with a back stroke of his spear (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 2: 18-32</reflink>).</description>
    <description>Being rebuked by Ish-bosheth for the impropriety of taking to wife Rizpah, who had been a concubine of King Saul, he found an excuse for going over to the side of David, whom he now professed to regard as anointed by the Lord to reign over all Israel. David received him favourably, and promised that he would have command of the armies. At this time Joab was absent from Hebron, but on his return he found what had happened. Abner had just left the city; but Joab by a stratagem recalled him, and meeting him at the gate of the city on his return, thrust him through with his sword (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 3:27, 31-39; 4:12. Comp. 1 Kings 2:5, 32</reflink>). David lamented in pathetic words the death of Abner, "Know ye not that there is a prince and a great man fallen this day in Israel?" (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 3:33-38.</reflink>)</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Abomination">
    <description>This word is used, (1.) To express the idea that the Egyptians considered themselves as defiled when they ate with strangers (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 43:32</reflink>). The Jews subsequently followed the same practice, holding it unlawful to eat or drink with foreigners (<reflink target="XXX">John 18:28; Acts 10:28; 11:3</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(2.) Every shepherd was "an abomination" unto the Egyptians (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 46:34</reflink>). This aversion to shepherds, such as the Hebrews, arose probably from the fact that Lower and Middle Egypt had formerly been held in oppressive subjection by a tribe of nomad shepherds (the Hyksos), who had only recently been expelled, and partly also perhaps from this other fact that the Egyptians detested the lawless habits of these wandering shepherds.</description>
    <description>(3.) Pharaoh was so moved by the fourth plague, that while he refused the demand of Moses, he offered a compromise, granting to the Israelites permission to hold their festival and offer their sacrifices in Egypt. This permission could not be accepted, because Moses said they would have to sacrifice "the abomination of the Egyptians" (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 8:26</reflink>); i.e., the cow or ox, which all the Egyptians held as sacred, and which they regarded it as sacrilegious to kill.</description>
    <description>(4.) Daniel (11:31), in that section of his prophecies which is generally interpreted as referring to the fearful calamities that were to fall on the Jews in the time of Antiochus Epiphanes, says, "And they shall place the abomination that maketh desolate." Antiochus Epiphanes caused an altar to be erected on the altar of burnt-offering, on which sacrifices were offered to Jupiter Olympus. (Comp. 1 Macc. 1:57). This was the abomination of the desolation of Jerusalem. The same language is employed in Dan. 9:27 (<reflink target="XXX">comp. Matt. 24:15</reflink>), where the reference is probably to the image-crowned standards which the Romans set up at the east gate of the temple (A.D. 70), and to which they paid idolatrous honours. "Almost the entire religion of the Roman camp consisted in worshipping the ensign, swearing by the ensign, and in preferring the ensign before all other gods." These ensigns were an "abomination" to the Jews, the "abomination of desolation."</description>
    <description>This word is also used symbolically of sin in general (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 66:3</reflink>); an idol (44:19); the ceremonies of the apostate Church of Rome (<reflink target="XXX">Rev. 17:4</reflink>); a detestable act (<reflink target="XXX">Ezek. 22:11</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Abraham">
    <description>father of a multitude, son of Terah, named (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 11:27</reflink>) before his older brothers Nahor and Haran, because he was the heir of the promises. Till the age of seventy, Abram sojourned among his kindred in his native country of Chaldea. He then, with his father and his family and household, quitted the city of Ur, in which he had hitherto dwelt, and went some 300 miles north to Haran, where he abode fifteen years. The cause of his migration was a call from God (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 7:2-4</reflink>). There is no mention of this first call in the Old Testament; it is implied, however, in Gen. 12. While they tarried at Haran, Terah died at the age of 205 years. Abram now received a second and more definite call, accompanied by a promise from God (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 12:1,2</reflink>); whereupon he took his departure, taking his nephew Lot with him, "not knowing whither he went" (<reflink target="XXX">Heb. 11:8</reflink>). He trusted implicitly to the guidance of Him who had called him.</description>
    <description>Abram now, with a large household of probably a thousand souls, entered on a migratory life, and dwelt in tents. Passing along the valley of the Jabbok, in the land of Canaan, he formed his first encampment at Sichem (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 12:6</reflink>), in the vale or oak-grove of Moreh, between Ebal on the north and Gerizim on the south. Here he received the great promise, "I will make of thee a great nation," etc. (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 12:2,3,7</reflink>). This promise comprehended not only temporal but also spiritual blessings. It implied that he was the chosen ancestor of the great Deliverer whose coming had been long ago predicted (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 3:15</reflink>). Soon after this, for some reason not mentioned, he removed his tent to the mountain district between Bethel, then called Luz, and Ai, towns about two miles apart, where he built an altar to "Jehovah." He again moved into the southern tract of Palestine, called by the Hebrews the Negeb; and was at length, on account of a famine, compelled to go down into Egypt. This took place in the time of the Hyksos, a Semitic race which now held the Egyptians in bondage. Here occurred that case of deception on the part of Abram which exposed him to the rebuke of Pharaoh (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 12:18</reflink>). Sarai was restored to him; and Pharaoh loaded him with presents, recommending him to withdraw from the country. He returned to Canaan richer than when he left it, "in cattle, in silver, and in gold" (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 12:8; 13:2. Comp. Ps. 105:13, 14</reflink>). The whole party then moved northward, and returned to their previous station near Bethel. Here disputes arose between Lot's shepherds and those of Abram about water and pasturage. Abram generously gave Lot his choice of the pasture-ground. (Comp. 1 Cor. 6:7.) He chose the well-watered plain in which Sodom was situated, and removed thither; and thus the uncle and nephew were separated. Immediately after this Abram was cheered by a repetition of the promises already made to him, and then removed to the plain or "oak-grove" of Mamre, which is in Hebron. He finally settled here, pitching his tent under a famous oak or terebinth tree, called "the oak of Mamre" (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 13:18</reflink>). This was his third resting-place in the land.</description>
    <description>Some fourteen years before this, while Abram was still in Chaldea, Palestine had been invaded by Chedorlaomer, King of Elam, who brought under tribute to him the five cities in the plain to which Lot had removed. This tribute was felt by the inhabitants of these cities to be a heavy burden, and after twelve years they revolted. This brought upon them the vengeance of Chedorlaomer, who had in league with him four other kings. He ravaged the whole country, plundering the towns, and carrying the inhabitants away as slaves. Among those thus treated was Lot. Hearing of the disaster that had fallen on his nephew, Abram immediately gathered from his own household a band of 318 armed men, and being joined by the Amoritish chiefs Mamre, Aner, and Eshcol, he pursued after Chedorlaomer, and overtook him near the springs of the Jordan. They attacked and routed his army, and pursued it over the range of Anti-Libanus as far as to Hobah, near Damascus, and then returned, bringing back all the spoils that had been carried away. Returning by way of Salem, i.e., Jerusalem, the king of that place, Melchizedek, came forth to meet them with refreshments. To him Abram presented a tenth of the spoils, in recognition of his character as a priest of the most high God (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 14:18-20</reflink>).</description>
    <description>In a recently-discovered tablet, dated in the reign of the grandfather of Amraphel (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 14:1</reflink>), one of the witnesses is called "the Amorite, the son of Abiramu," or Abram.</description>
    <description>Having returned to his home at Mamre, the promises already made to him by God were repeated and enlarged (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 13:14</reflink>). "The word of the Lord" (an expression occurring here for the first time) "came to him" (15:1). He now understood better the future that lay before the nation that was to spring from him. Sarai, now seventy-five years old, in her impatience, persuaded Abram to take Hagar, her Egyptian maid, as a concubine, intending that whatever child might be born should be reckoned as her own. Ishmael was accordingly thus brought up, and was regarded as the heir of these promises (Gen. 16). When Ishmael was thirteen years old, God again revealed yet more explicitly and fully his gracious purpose; and in token of the sure fulfilment of that purpose the patriarch's name was now changed from Abram to Abraham (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 17:4,5</reflink>), and the rite of circumcision was instituted as a sign of the covenant. It was then announced that the heir to these covenant promises would be the son of Sarai, though she was now ninety years old; and it was directed that his name should be Isaac. At the same time, in commemoration of the promises, Sarai's name was changed to Sarah. On that memorable day of God's thus revealing his design, Abraham and his son Ishmael and all the males of his house were circumcised (Gen. 17). Three months after this, as Abraham sat in his tent door, he saw three men approaching. They accepted his proffered hospitality, and, seated under an oak-tree, partook of the fare which Abraham and Sarah provided. One of the three visitants was none other than the Lord, and the other two were angels in the guise of men. The Lord renewed on this occasion his promise of a son by Sarah, who was rebuked for her unbelief. Abraham accompanied the three as they proceeded on their journey. The two angels went on toward Sodom; while the Lord tarried behind and talked with Abraham, making known to him the destruction that was about to fall on that guilty city. The patriarch interceded earnestly in behalf of the doomed city. But as not even ten righteous persons were found in it, for whose sake the city would have been spared, the threatened destruction fell upon it; and early next morning Abraham saw the smoke of the fire that consumed it as the "smoke of a furnace" (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 19:1-28</reflink>).</description>
    <description>After fifteen years' residence at Mamre, Abraham moved southward, and pitched his tent among the Philistines, near to Gerar. Here occurred that sad instance of prevarication on his part in his relation to Abimelech the King (Gen. 20). (<see target="x-self">See ABIMELECH.</see>) Soon after this event, the patriarch left the vicinity of Gerar, and moved down the fertile valley about 25 miles to Beer-sheba. It was probably here that Isaac was born, Abraham being now an hundred years old. A feeling of jealousy now arose between Sarah and Hagar, whose son, Ishmael, was no longer to be regarded as Abraham's heir. Sarah insisted that both Hagar and her son should be sent away. This was done, although it was a hard trial to Abraham (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 21:12</reflink>). (<see target="x-self">See HAGAR ; ISHMAEL.</see>)</description>
    <description>At this point there is a blank in the patriarch's history of perhaps twenty-five years. These years of peace and happiness were spent at Beer-sheba. The next time we see him his faith is put to a severe test by the command that suddenly came to him to go and offer up Isaac, the heir of all the promises, as a sacrifice on one of the mountains of Moriah. His faith stood the test (<reflink target="XXX">Heb. 11:17-19</reflink>). He proceeded in a spirit of unhesitating obedience to carry out the command; and when about to slay his son, whom he had laid on the altar, his uplifted hand was arrested by the angel of Jehovah, and a ram, which was entangled in a thicket near at hand, was seized and offered in his stead. From this circumstance that place was called Jehovah-jireh, i.e., "The Lord will provide." The promises made to Abraham were again confirmed (and this was the last recorded word of God to the patriarch); and he descended the mount with his son, and returned to his home at Beer-sheba (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 22:19</reflink>), where he resided for some years, and then moved northward to Hebron.</description>
    <description>Some years after this Sarah died at Hebron, being 127 years old. Abraham acquired now the needful possession of a burying-place, the cave of Machpelah, by purchase from the owner of it, Ephron the Hittite (Gen. 23); and there he buried Sarah. His next care was to provide a wife for Isaac, and for this purpose he sent his steward, Eliezer, to Haran (or Charran, Acts 7:2), where his brother Nahor and his family resided (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 11:31</reflink>). The result was that Rebekah, the daughter of Nahor's son Bethuel, became the wife of Isaac (Gen. 24). Abraham then himself took to wife Keturah, who became the mother of six sons, whose descendants were afterwards known as the "children of the east" (<reflink target="XXX">Judg. 6:3</reflink>), and later as "Saracens." At length all his wanderings came to an end. At the age of 175 years, 100 years after he had first entered the land of Canaan, he died, and was buried in the old family burying-place at Machpelah (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 25:7-10</reflink>).</description>
    <description>The history of Abraham made a wide and deep impression on the ancient world, and references to it are interwoven in the religious traditions of almost all Eastern nations. He is called "the friend of God" (<reflink target="XXX">James 2:23</reflink>), "faithful Abraham" (<reflink target="XXX">Gal. 3:9</reflink>), "the father of us all" (<reflink target="XXX">Rom. 4:16</reflink>).</description>

  <item id="Abraham's bosom">
    <description>(<reflink target="XXX">Luke 16:22,23</reflink>) refers to the custom of reclining on couches at table, which was prevalent among the Jews, an arrangement which brought the head of one person almost into the bosom of the one who sat or reclined above him. To "be in Abraham's bosom" thus meant to enjoy happiness and rest (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 8:11; Luke 16:23</reflink>) at the banquet in Paradise. (See BANQUET; MEALS</description>

  <item id="Absalom">
    <description>father of peace; i.e., "peaceful" David's son by Maacah (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 3:3; comp. 1 Kings 1:6</reflink>). He was noted for his personal beauty and for the extra-ordinary profusion of the hair of his head (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 14:25,26</reflink>). The first public act of his life was the blood-revenge he executed against Amnon, David's eldest son, who had basely wronged Absalom's sister Tamar. This revenge was executed at the time of the festivities connected with a great sheep-shearing at Baal-hazor. David's other sons fled from the place in horror, and brought the tidings of the death of Amnon to Jerusalem. Alarmed for the consequences of the act, Absalom fled to his grandfather at Geshur, and there abode for three years (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 3:3; 13:23-38</reflink>).</description>
    <description>David mourned his absent son, now branded with the guilt of fratricide. As the result of a stratagem carried out by a woman of Tekoah, Joab received David's sanction to invite Absalom back to Jerusalem. He returned accordingly, but two years elapsed before his father admitted him into his presence (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 14:28</reflink>). Absalom was now probably the oldest surviving son of David, and as he was of royal descent by his mother as well as by his father, he began to aspire to the throne. His pretensions were favoured by the people. By many arts he gained their affection; and after his return from Geshur (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 15:7; marg., R.V.</reflink>) he went up to Hebron, the old capital of Judah, along with a great body of the people, and there proclaimed himself king. The revolt was so successful that David found it necessary to quit Jerusalem and flee to Mahanaim, beyond Jordan; where upon Absalom returned to Jerusalem and took possession of the throne without opposition. Ahithophel, who had been David's chief counsellor, deserted him and joined Absalom, whose chief counsellor he now became. Hushai also joined Absalom, but only for the purpose of trying to counteract the counsels of Ahithophel, and so to advantage David's cause. He was so far successful that by his advice, which was preferred to that of Ahithophel, Absalom delayed to march an army against his father, who thus gained time to prepare for the defence.</description>
    <description>Absalom at length marched out against his father, whose army, under the command of Joab, he encountered on the borders of the forest of Ephraim. Twenty thousand of Absalom's army were slain in that fatal battle, and the rest fled. Absalom fled on a swift mule; but his long flowing hair, or more probably his head, was caught in the bough of an oak, and there he was left suspended till Joab came up and pierced him through with three darts. His body was then taken down and cast into a pit dug in the forest, and a heap of stones was raised over his grave. When the tidings of the result of that battle were brought to David, as he sat impatiently at the gate of Mahanaim, and he was told that Absalom had been slain, he gave way to the bitter lamentation: "O my son Absalom, my son, my son Absalom! would God I had died for thee, O Absalom, my son, my son!" (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 18:33. Comp. Ex. 32:32; Rom. 9:3</reflink>).</description>
    <description>Absalom's three sons (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 14:27; comp. 18:18</reflink>) had all died before him, so that he left only a daughter, Tamar, who became the grandmother of Abijah.</description>

  <item id="Acacia">
    <description>(Heb. shittim) Ex. 25:5, R.V. probably the Acacia seyal (the gum-arabic tree); called the "shittah" tree (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 41:19</reflink>). Its wood is called shittim wood (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 26:15,26; 25:10,13,23,28, etc.</reflink>). This species (A. seyal) is like the hawthorn, a gnarled and thorny tree. It yields the gum-arabic of commerce. It is found in abundance in the Sinaitic peninsula.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Accad">
    <description>the high land or mountains, a city in the land of Shinar. It has been identified with the mounds of Akker Kuf, some 50 miles to the north of Babylon; but this is doubtful. It was one of the cities of Nimrod's kingdom (<reflink target="XXX">Ge 10:10</reflink>). It stood close to the Euphrates, opposite Sippara. (<see target="x-self">See SEPHARVAIM.</see>)</description>
    <description>It is also the name of the country of which this city was the capital, namely, northern or upper Babylonia. The Accadians who came from the "mountains of the east," where the ark rested, attained to a high degree of civilization. In the Babylonian inscriptions they are called "the black heads" and "the black faces," in contrast to "the white race" of Semitic descent. They invented the form of writing in pictorial hieroglyphics, and also the cuneiform system, in which they wrote many books partly on papyrus and partly on clay. The Semitic Babylonians ("the white race"), or, as some scholars think, first the Cushites, and afterwards, as a second immigration, the Semites, invaded and conquered this country; and then the Accadian language ceased to be a spoken language, although for the sake of its literary treasures it continued to be studied by the educated classes of Babylonia. A large portion of the Ninevite tablets brought to light by Oriental research consists of interlinear or parallel translations from Accadian into Assyrian; and thus that long-forgotten language has been recovered by scholars. It belongs to the class of languages called agglutinative, common to the Tauranian race; i.e., it consists of words "glued together," without declension of conjugation. These tablets in a remarkable manner illustrate ancient history. Among other notable records, they contain an account of the Creation which closely resembles that given in the book of Genesis, of the Sabbath as a day of rest, and of the Deluge and its cause.

  <item id="Accho">
    <description>sultry or sandy, a town and harbour of Phoenicia, in the tribe of Asher, but never acquired by them (<reflink target="XXX">Judg. 1:31</reflink>). It was known to the ancient Greeks and Romans by the name of Ptolemais, from Ptolemy the king of Egypt, who rebuilt it about B.C. 100. Here Paul landed on his last journey to Jerusalem (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 21:7</reflink>). During the crusades of the Middle Ages it was called Acra; and subsequently, on account of its being occupied by the Knights Hospitallers of Jerusalem, it was called St. Jean d'Acre, or simply Acre.</description>

  <item id="Accuser">
    <description>Satan is styled the "accuser of the brethren" (<reflink target="XXX">Rev. 12:10. Comp. Job 1:6; Zech. 3:1</reflink>), as seeking to uphold his influence among men by bringing false charges against Christians, with the view of weakening their influence and injuring the cause with which they are identified. He was regarded by the Jews as the accuser of men before God, laying to their charge the violations of the law of which they were guilty, and demanding their punishment. The same Greek word, rendered "accuser," is found in John 8:10 (but omitted in the Revised Version); Acts 23:30, 35; 24:8; 25:16, 18, in all of which places it is used of one who brings a charge against another.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Aceldama">
    <description>the name which the Jews gave in their proper tongue, i.e., in Aramaic, to the field which was purchased with the money which had been given to the betrayer of our Lord. The word means "field of blood." It was previously called "the potter's field" (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 27:7, 8; Acts 1:19</reflink>), and was appropriated as the burial-place for strangers. It lies on a narrow level terrace on the south face of the valley of Hinnom. Its modern name is Hak ed-damm.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Achaia">
    <description>the name originally of a narrow strip of territory in Greece, on the north-west of the Peloponnesus. Subsequently it was applied by the Romans to the whole Peloponnesus, now called the Morea, and the south of Greece. It was then one of the two provinces (Macedonia being the other) into which they divided the country when it fell under their dominion. It is in this latter enlarged meaning that the name is always used in the New Testament (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 18:12, 27; 19:21; Rom. 15: 26; 16:5, etc.</reflink>). It was at the time when Luke wrote the Acts of the Apostles under the proconsular form of government; hence the appropriate title given to Gallio as the "deputy," i.e., proconsul, of Achaia (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 18:12</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Achaichus">
    <description>(<reflink target="XXX">1 Cor. 16:17</reflink>), one of the members of the church of Corinth who, with Fortunatus and Stephanas, visited Paul while he was at Ephesus, for the purpose of consulting him on the affairs of the church. These three probably were the bearers of the letter from Corinth to the apostle to which he alludes in 1 Cor. 7:1.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Achan">
    <description>called also Achar, i.e., one who troubles (<reflink target="XXX">1 Chr. 2:7</reflink>), in commemoration of his crime, which brought upon him an awful destruction (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 7:1</reflink>). On the occasion of the fall of Jericho, he seized, contrary to the divine command, an ingot of gold, a quantity of silver, and a costly Babylonish garment, which he hid in his tent. Joshua was convinced that the defeat which the Israelites afterwards sustained before Ai was a proof of the divine displeasure on account of some crime, and he at once adopted means by the use of the lot for discovering the criminal. It was then found that Achan was guilty, and he was stoned to death in the valley of Achor. He and all that belonged to him were then consumed by fire, and a heap of stones was raised over the ashes.</description>

  <item id="Achbor">
    <description>gnawing = mouse. (1.) An Edomitish king (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 36:38; 1 Chr. 1:49</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(2.) One of Josiah's officers sent to the prophetess Huldah to inquire regarding the newly-discovered book of the law (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 22:12, 14</reflink>). He is also called Abdon (<reflink target="XXX">2 Chr. 34:20</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Achish">
    <description>angry, perhaps only a general title of royalty applicable to the Philistine kings. (1.) The king with whom David sought refuge when he fled from Saul (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 21:10-15</reflink>). He is called Abimelech in the superscription of Ps. 34. It was probably this same king to whom David a second time repaired at the head of a band of 600 warriors, and who assigned him Ziklag, whence he carried on war against the surrounding tribes (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 27:5-12</reflink>). Achish had great confidence in the valour and fidelity of David (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 28:1,2</reflink>), but at the instigation of his courtiers did not permit him to go up to battle along with the Philistine hosts (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 29:2-11</reflink>). David remained with Achish a year and four months. (2.) Another king of Gath, probably grandson of the foregoing, to whom the two servants of Shimei fled. This led Shimei to go to Gath in pursuit of them, and the consequence was that Solomon put him to death (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 2:39-46</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Achmetha">
    <description>(<reflink target="XXX">Ezra 6:2</reflink>), called Ecbatana by classical writers, the capital of northern Media. Here was the palace which was the residence of the old Median monarchs, and of Cyrus and Cambyses. In the time of Ezra, the Persian kings resided usually at Susa of Babylon. But Cyrus held his court at Achmetha; and Ezra, writing a century after, correctly mentions the place where the decree of Cyrus was found.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Achor">
    <description>trouble, a valley near Jericho, so called in consequence of the trouble which the sin of Achan caused Israel (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 7:24,26</reflink>). The expression "valley of Achor" probably became proverbial for that which caused trouble, and when Isaiah (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 65:10</reflink>) refers to it he uses it in this sense: "The valley of Achor, a place for herds to lie down in;" i.e., that which had been a source of calamity would become a source of blessing. Hosea also (<reflink target="XXX">Hos. 2:15</reflink>) uses the expression in the same sense: "The valley of Achor for a door of hope;" i.e., trouble would be turned into joy, despair into hope. This valley has been identified with the Wady Kelt.</description>

  <item id="Achsah">
    <description>anklet, Caleb's only daughter (<reflink target="XXX">1 Chr. 2:49</reflink>). She was offered in marriage to the man who would lead an attack on the city of Debir, or Kirjath-sepher. This was done by Othniel (q.v.), who accordingly obtained her as his wife (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 15:16-19; Judg. 1:9-15</reflink>).</description>

  <item id="Achshaph">
    <description>fascination, a royal city of the Canaanites, in the north of Palestine (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 11:1; 12:20; 19:25</reflink>). It was in the eastern boundary of the tribe of Asher, and is identified with the modern ruined village of Kesaf or Yasif, N.E. of Accho.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Achzib">
    <description>falsehood. (1.) A town in the Shephelah, or plain country of Judah (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 15:44</reflink>); probably the same as Chezib of Gen. 38:5 = Ain Kezbeh.</description>
    <description>(2.) A Phoenician city (the Gr. Ecdippa), always retained in their possession though assigned to the tribe of Asher (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 19:29; Judg. 1:31</reflink>). It is identified with the modern es-Zib, on the Mediterranean, about 8 miles north of Accho.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Acre">
    <description>is the translation of a word (tse'med), which properly means a yoke, and denotes a space of ground that may be ploughed by a yoke of oxen in a day. It is about an acre of our measure (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 5:10; 1 Sam. 14:14</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Acts of the Apostles">
    <description>the title now given to the fifth and last of the historical books of the New Testament. The author styles it a "treatise" (1:1). It was early called "The Acts," "The Gospel of the Holy Ghost," and "The Gospel of the Resurrection." It contains properly no account of any of the apostles except Peter and Paul. John is noticed only three times; and all that is recorded of James, the son of Zebedee, is his execution by Herod. It is properly therefore not the history of the "Acts of the Apostles," a title which was given to the book at a later date, but of "Acts of Apostles," or more correctly, of "Some Acts of Certain Apostles."</description>
    <description>As regards its authorship, it was certainly the work of Luke, the "beloved physician" (<reflink target="XXX">comp. Luke 1:1-4; Acts 1:1</reflink>). This is the uniform tradition of antiquity, although the writer nowhere makes mention of himself by name. The style and idiom of the Gospel of Luke and of the Acts, and the usage of words and phrases common to both, strengthen this opinion. The writer first appears in the narrative in 16:11, and then disappears till Paul's return to Philippi two years afterwards, when he and Paul left that place together (20:6), and the two seem henceforth to have been constant companions to the end. He was certainly with Paul at Rome (28; Col. 4:14). Thus he wrote a great portion of that history from personal observation. For what lay beyond his own experience he had the instruction of Paul. If, as is very probable, 2 Tim. was written during Paul's second imprisonment at Rome, Luke was with him then as his faithful companion to the last (<reflink target="XXX">2 Tim. 4:11</reflink>). Of his subsequent history we have no certain information.</description>
    <description>The design of Luke's Gospel was to give an exhibition of the character and work of Christ as seen in his history till he was taken up from his disciples into heaven; and of the Acts, as its sequel, to give an illustration of the power and working of the gospel when preached among all nations, "beginning at Jerusalem." The opening sentences of the Acts are just an expansion and an explanation of the closing words of the Gospel. In this book we have just a continuation of the history of the church after Christ's ascension. Luke here carries on the history in the same spirit in which he had commenced it. It is only a book of beginnings, a history of the founding of churches, the initial steps in the formation of the Christian society in the different places visited by the apostles. It records a cycle of "representative events."</description>
    <description>All through the narrative we see the ever-present, all-controlling power of the ever-living Saviour. He worketh all and in all in spreading abroad his truth among men by his Spirit and through the instrumentality of his apostles.</description>
    <description>The time of the writing of this history may be gathered from the fact that the narrative extends down to the close of the second year of Paul's first imprisonment at Rome. It could not therefore have been written earlier than A.D. 61 or 62, nor later than about the end of A.D. 63. Paul was probably put to death during his second imprisonment, about A.D. 64, or, as some think, 66.</description>
    <description>The place where the book was written was probably Rome, to which Luke accompanied Paul.</description>
    <description>The key to the contents of the book is in 1:8, "Ye shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem, and in all Judea, and in Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the earth." After referring to what had been recorded in a "former treatise" of the sayings and doings of Jesus Christ before his ascension, the author proceeds to give an account of the circumstances connected with that event, and then records the leading facts with reference to the spread and triumphs of Christianity over the world during a period of about thirty years. The record begins with Pentecost (A.D. 33) and ends with Paul's first imprisonment (A.D. 63 or 64). The whole contents of the book may be divided into these three parts:</description>
    <description>(1.) Chaps. 1-12, describing the first twelve years of the Christian church. This section has been entitled "From Jerusalem to Antioch." It contains the history of the planting and extension of the church among the Jews by the ministry of Peter.</description>
    <description>(2.) Chaps. 13-21, Paul's missionary journeys, giving the history of the extension and planting of the church among the Gentiles.</description>
    <description>(3.) Chaps. 21-28, Paul at Rome, and the events which led to this. Chaps. 13-28 have been entitled "From Antioch to Rome."</description>
    <description>In this book it is worthy of note that no mention is made of the writing by Paul of any of his epistles. This may be accounted for by the fact that the writer confined himself to a history of the planting of the church, and not to that of its training or edification. The relation, however, between this history and the epistles of Paul is of such a kind, i.e., brings to light so many undesigned coincidences, as to prove the genuineness and authenticity of both, as is so ably shown by Paley in his _Horae Paulinae_. "No ancient work affords so many tests of veracity; for no other has such numerous points of contact in all directions with contemporary history, politics, and topography, whether Jewish, or Greek, or Roman." Lightfoot. (<see target="x-self">See PAUL.</see>)</description>

  <item id="Adam">
    <description>red, a Babylonian word, the generic name for man, having the same meaning in the Hebrew and the Assyrian languages. It was the name given to the first man, whose creation, fall, and subsequent history and that of his descendants are detailed in the first book of Moses (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 1:27-ch. 5</reflink>). "God created man [Heb., Adam] in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them."</description>
    <description>Adam was absolutely the first man whom God created. He was formed out of the dust of the earth (and hence his name), and God breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and gave him dominion over all the lower creatures (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 1:26; 2:7</reflink>). He was placed after his creation in the Garden of Eden, to cultivate it, and to enjoy its fruits under this one prohibition: "Of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil thou shalt not eat of it; for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die."</description>
    <description>The first recorded act of Adam was his giving names to the beasts of the field and the fowls of the air, which God brought to him for this end. Thereafter the Lord caused a deep sleep to fall upon him, and while in an unconscious state took one of his ribs, and closed up his flesh again; and of this rib he made a woman, whom he presented to him when he awoke. Adam received her as his wife, and said, "This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh: she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man." He called her Eve, because she was the mother of all living.</description>
    <description>Being induced by the tempter in the form of a serpent to eat the forbidden fruit, Eve persuaded Adam, and he also did eat. Thus man fell, and brought upon himself and his posterity all the sad consequences of his transgression. The narrative of the Fall comprehends in it the great promise of a Deliverer (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 3:15</reflink>), the "first gospel" message to man. They were expelled from Eden, and at the east of the garden God placed a flame, which turned every way, to prevent access to the tree of life (Gen. 3). How long they were in Paradise is matter of mere conjecture.</description>
    <description>Shortly after their expulsion Eve brought forth her first-born, and called him Cain. Although we have the names of only three of Adam's sons, viz., Cain, Abel, and Seth, yet it is obvious that he had several sons and daughters (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 5:4</reflink>). He died aged 930 years.</description>
    <description>Adam and Eve were the progenitors of the whole human race. Evidences of varied kinds are abundant in proving the unity of the human race. The investigations of science, altogether independent of historical evidence, lead to the conclusion that God "hath made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell on all the face of the earth" (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 17:26. Comp. Rom. 5:12-12; 1 Cor. 15:22-49</reflink>).</description>

  <item id="Adam, a type">

It is an emblem of firmness in resisting adversaries of the truth (<reflink target="XXX">Zech. 7:12</reflink>), and of hard-heartedness against the truth (<reflink target="XXX">Jer. 17:1</reflink>).</description>

It included the days extending from the new moon of our March to the new moon of April. The name was first used after the Captivity. When the season was backward, and the lambs not yet of a paschal size, or the barley not forward enough for abib, then a month called Veadar, i.e., a second Adar, was intercalated.</description>

  <item id="Adder">
    <description>(<reflink target="XXX">Ps. 140:3; Rom. 3:13, "asp"</reflink>) is the rendering of, (1.) Akshub ("coiling" or "lying in wait"), properly an asp or viper, found only in this passage. (2.) Pethen ("twisting"), a viper or venomous serpent identified with the cobra (Naja haje) (<reflink target="XXX">Ps. 58:4; 91:13</reflink>); elsewhere "asp." (3.) Tziphoni ("hissing") (<reflink target="XXX">Prov. 23:32</reflink>); elsewhere rendered "cockatrice," Isa. 11:8; 14:29; 59:5; Jer. 8:17, as it is here in the margin of the Authorized Version. The Revised Version has "basilisk." This may have been the yellow viper, the Daboia xanthina, the largest and most dangerous of the vipers of Palestine. (4.) Shephiphon ("creeping"), occurring only in Gen. 49:17, the small speckled venomous snake, the "horned snake," or cerastes. Dan is compared to this serpent, which springs from its hiding-place on the passer-by.</description>

    <description>We have in the New Testament a striking example of this (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 26:63; Mark 5:7</reflink>), where the high priest calls upon Christ to avow his true character. It would seem that in such a case the person so adjured could not refuse to give an answer.</description>

  <item id="Adoni-zedec">
    <description>lord of justice or righteousness, was king in Jerusalem at the time when the Israelites invaded Palestine (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 10:1,3</reflink>). He formed a confederacy with the other Canaanitish kings against the Israelites, but was utterly routed by Joshua when he was engaged in besieging the Gibeonites. The history of this victory and of the treatment of the five confederated kings is recorded in Josh. 10:1-27. (<reflink target="XXX">Comp. Deut. 21:23</reflink>). Among the Tell Amarna tablets (<see target="x-self">see EGYPT</see>) are some very interesting letters from Adoni-zedec to the King of Egypt. These illustrate in a very remarkable manner the history recorded in Josh. 10, and indeed throw light on the wars of conquest generally, so that they may be read as a kind of commentary on the book of Joshua. Here the conquering career of the Abiri (i.e., Hebrews) is graphically described: "Behold, I say that the land of the king my lord is ruined", "The wars are mighty against me", "The Hebrew chiefs plunder all the king's lands", "Behold, I the chief of the Amorites am breaking to pieces." Then he implores the king of Egypt to send soldiers to help him, directing that the army should come by sea to Ascalon or Gaza, and thence march to Wru-sa-lim (Jerusalem) by the valley of Elah.</description>

After the death of his elder brothers, Amnon and Absalom, he became heir-apparent to the throne. But Solomon, a younger brother, was preferred to him. Adonijah, however, when his father was dying, caused himself to be proclaimed king. But Nathan and Bathsheba induced David to give orders that Solomon should at once be proclaimed and admitted to the throne. Adonijah fled and took refuge at the altar, and received pardon for his conduct from Solomon on the condition that he showed himself "a worthy man" (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 1:5-53</reflink>). He afterwards made a second attempt to gain the throne, but was seized and put to death (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 2:13-25</reflink>).</description>

    <description>(3.) Spiritual. An act of God's grace by which he brings men into the number of his redeemed family, and makes them partakers of all the blessings he has provided for them. Adoption represents the new relations into which the believer is introduced by justification, and the privileges connected therewith, viz., an interest in God's peculiar love (<reflink target="XXX">John 17:23; Rom. 5:5-8</reflink>), a spiritual nature (<reflink target="XXX">2 Pet. 1:4; John 1:13</reflink>), the possession of a spirit becoming children of God (<reflink target="XXX">1 Pet. 1:14; 2 John 4; Rom. 8:15-21; Gal. 5:1; Heb. 2:15</reflink>), present protection, consolation, supplies (<reflink target="XXX">Luke 12:27-32; John 14:18; 1 Cor. 3:21-23; 2 Cor. 1:4</reflink>), fatherly chastisements (<reflink target="XXX">Heb. 12:5-11</reflink>), and a future glorious inheritance (<reflink target="XXX">Rom. 8:17,23; James 2:5; Phil. 3:21</reflink>).</description>

  <item id="Adullam">
    <description>one of the royal cities of the Canaanites, now 'Aid-el-ma (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 12:15; 15:35</reflink>). It stood on the old Roman road in the valley of Elah (q.v.), which was the scene of David's memorable victory over Goliath (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 17:2</reflink>), and not far from Gath. It was one of the towns which Rehoboam fortified against Egypt (<reflink target="XXX">2 Chr. 11:7</reflink>). It was called "the glory of Israel" (<reflink target="XXX">Micah 1:15</reflink>).</description>
    <description>The Cave of Adullam has been discovered about 2 miles south of the scene of David's triumph, and about 13 miles west from Bethlehem.

Some of these caverns are large enough to hold 200 or 300 men.

  <item id="Adultery">
    <description>conjugal infidelity. An adulterer was a man who had illicit intercourse with a married or a betrothed woman, and such a woman was an adulteress. Intercourse between a married man and an unmarried woman was fornication. Adultery was regarded as a great social wrong, as well as a great sin.</description>
    <description>The Mosaic law (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 5:11-31</reflink>) prescribed that the suspected wife should be tried by the ordeal of the "water of jealousy." There is, however, no recorded instance of the application of this law. In subsequent times the Rabbis made various regulations with the view of discovering the guilty party, and of bringing about a divorce. It has been inferred from John 8:1-11 that this sin became very common during the age preceding the destruction of Jerusalem.</description>
    <description>Idolatry, covetousness, and apostasy are spoken of as adultery spiritually (<reflink target="XXX">Jer. 3:6, 8, 9; Ezek. 16:32; Hos. 1:2:3; Rev. 2:22</reflink>). An apostate church is an adulteress (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 1:21; Ezek. 23:4, 7, 37</reflink>), and the Jews are styled "an adulterous generation" (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 12:39</reflink>).

It is a name given by Christ three times to the Holy Ghost (<reflink target="XXX">John 14:16; 15:26; 16:7, where the Greek word is rendered "Comforter," q.v.</reflink>). It is applied to Christ in 1 John 2:1, where the same Greek word is rendered "Advocate," the rendering which it should have in all the places where it occurs.

  </item>
  <item id="Affection">
    <description>feeling or emotion. Mention is made of "vile affections" (<reflink target="XXX">Rom. 1:26</reflink>) and "inordinate affection" (<reflink target="XXX">Col. 3:5</reflink>). Christians are exhorted to set their affections on things above (<reflink target="XXX">Col. 3:2</reflink>).

  <item id="Affinity">
    <description>relationship by alliance (<reflink target="XXX">2 Chr. 18:1</reflink>) or by marriage (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 3:1</reflink>). Marriages are prohibited within certain degrees of affinity, enumerated Lev. 18:6-17. Consanguinity is relationship by blood.</description>

  <item id="Agabus">
    <description>a "prophet," probably one of the seventy disciples of Christ. He prophesied at Antioch of an approaching famine (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 11:27, 28</reflink>).

  </item>
  <item id="Agag">
    <description>flame, the usual title of the Amalekite kings, as "Pharaoh" was of the Egyptian. (1.) A king of the Amalekites referred to by Balaam (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 24:7</reflink>). He lived at the time of the Exodus.</description>
    <description>(2.) Another king of the Amalekites whom Saul spared unlawfully, but whom Samuel on his arrival in the camp of Saul ordered, in retributive justice (Judg. 1), to be brought out and cut in pieces (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 15:8-33.

  <item id="Agate">
    <description>(Heb. shebo), a precious stone in the breast-plate of the high priest (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 28:19; 39:12</reflink>), the second in the third row. This may be the agate properly so called, a semi-transparent crystallized quartz, probably brought from Sheba, whence its name. In Isa. 54:12 and Ezek. 27:16, this word is the rendering of the Hebrew cadcod, which means "ruddy," and denotes a variety of minutely crystalline silica more or less in bands of different tints.</description>
    <description>This word is from the Greek name of a stone found in the river Achates in Sicily.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Age">

Respect to be shown to the aged (<reflink target="XXX">Lev. 19:32</reflink>).

  <item id="Agony">
    <description>contest; wrestling; severe struggling with pain and suffering. Anguish is the reflection on evil that is already past, while agony is a struggle with evil at the time present. It is only used in the New Testament by Luke (22:44) to describe our Lord's fearful struggle in Gethsemane.</description>
    <description>The verb from which the noun "agony" is derived is used to denote an earnest endeavour or striving, as "Strive [agonize] to enter" (<reflink target="XXX">Luke 13:24</reflink>); "Then would my servants fight" [agonize] (<reflink target="XXX">John 18:36</reflink>). Comp. 1 Cor. 9:25; Col. 1:29; 4:12; 1 Tim. 6:12; 2 Tim. 4:7, where the words "striveth," "labour," "conflict," "fight," are the renderings of the same Greek verb.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Agriculture">
    <description>Tilling the ground (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 2:15; 4:2, 3, 12</reflink>) and rearing cattle were the chief employments in ancient times. The Egyptians excelled in agriculture. And after the Israelites entered into the possession of the Promised Land, their circumstances favoured in the highest degree a remarkable development of this art. Agriculture became indeed the basis of the Mosaic commonwealth.</description>
    <description>The year in Palestine was divided into six agricultural periods:-</description>
    <description>I. SOWING TIME. Tisri, latter half (beginning about the autumnal equinox.) Marchesvan. Kisleu, former half. Early rain due = first showers of autumn.</description>
    <description>II. UNRIPE TIME. Kisleu, latter half. Tebet. Sebat, former half.</description>
    <description>III. COLD SEASON. Sebat, latter half. Adar. [Veadar.] Nisan, former half. Latter rain due (<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 11:14; Jer. 5:24; Hos. 6:3; Zech. 10:1; James 5:7; Job 29:23</reflink>).</description>
    <description>IV. HARVEST TIME. Nisan, latter half. (Beginning about vernal equinox. Barley green. Passover.) Ijar. Sivan, former half., Wheat ripe. Pentecost.</description>
    <description>V. SUMMER (total absence of rain) Sivan, latter half. Tammuz. Ab, former half.</description>
    <description>VI. SULTRY SEASON Ab, latter half. Elul. Tisri, former half., Ingathering of fruits.</description>
    <description>The six months from the middle of Tisri to the middle of Nisan were occupied with the work of cultivation, and the rest of the year mainly with the gathering in of the fruits. The extensive and easily-arranged system of irrigation from the rills and streams from the mountains made the soil in every part of Palestine richly productive (<reflink target="XXX">Ps. 1:3; 65:10; Prov. 21:1; Isa. 30:25; 32:2, 20; Hos. 12:11</reflink>), and the appliances of careful cultivation and of manure increased its fertility to such an extent that in the days of Solomon, when there was an abundant population, "20,000 measures of wheat year by year" were sent to Hiram in exchange for timber (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 5:11</reflink>), and in large quantities also wheat was sent to the Tyrians for the merchandise in which they traded (<reflink target="XXX">Ezek. 27:17</reflink>). The wheat sometimes produced an hundredfold (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 26:12; Matt. 13:23</reflink>). Figs and pomegranates were very plentiful (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 13:23</reflink>), and the vine and the olive grew luxuriantly and produced abundant fruit (<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 33:24</reflink>).</description>
    <description>Lest the productiveness of the soil should be exhausted, it was enjoined that the whole land should rest every seventh year, when all agricultural labour would entirely cease (<reflink target="XXX">Lev. 25:1-7; Deut. 15:1-10</reflink>).</description>
    <description>It was forbidden to sow a field with divers seeds (<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 22:9</reflink>). A passer-by was at liberty to eat any quantity of corn or grapes, but he was not permitted to carry away any (<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 23:24, 25; Matt. 12:1</reflink>). The poor were permitted to claim the corners of the fields and the gleanings. A forgotten sheaf in the field was to be left also for the poor.

    <description>The sculptured monuments and painted tombs of Egypt and Assyria throw much light on this subject, and on the general operations of agriculture. Ploughs of a simple construction were known in the time of Moses (<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 22:10; comp. Job 1:14</reflink>). They were very light, and required great attention to keep them in the ground (<reflink target="XXX">Luke 9:62</reflink>). They were drawn by oxen (<reflink target="XXX">Job 1:14</reflink>), cows (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 6:7</reflink>), and asses (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 30:24</reflink>); but an ox and an ass must not be yoked together in the same plough (<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 22:10</reflink>). Men sometimes followed the plough with a hoe to break the clods (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 28:24</reflink>). The oxen were urged on by a "goad," or long staff pointed at the end, so that if occasion arose it could be used as a spear also (<reflink target="XXX">Judg. 3:31; 1 Sam. 13:21</reflink>).</description>
    <description>When the soil was prepared, the seed was sown broadcast over the field (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 13:3-8</reflink>). The "harrow" mentioned in Job 39:10 was not used to cover the seeds, but to break the clods, being little more than a thick block of wood. In highly irrigated spots the seed was trampled in by cattle (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 32:20</reflink>); but doubtless there was some kind of harrow also for covering in the seed scattered in the furrows of the field.</description>
    <description>The reaping of the corn was performed either by pulling it up by the roots, or cutting it with a species of sickle, according to circumstances. The corn when cut was generally put up in sheaves (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 37:7; Lev. 23:10-15; Ruth 2:7, 15; Job 24:10; Jer. 9:22; Micah 4:12</reflink>), which were afterwards gathered to the threshing-floor or stored in barns (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 6:26</reflink>).</description>
    <description>The process of threshing was performed generally by spreading the sheaves on the threshing-floor and causing oxen and cattle to tread repeatedly over them (<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 25:4; Isa. 28:28</reflink>). On occasions flails or sticks were used for this purpose (<reflink target="XXX">Ruth 2:17; Isa. 28:27</reflink>). There was also a "threshing instrument" (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 41:15; Amos 1:3</reflink>) which was drawn over the corn. It was called by the Hebrews a moreg, a threshing roller or sledge (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 24:22; 1 Chr. 21:23; Isa. 3:15</reflink>). It was somewhat like the Roman tribulum, or threshing instrument.</description>
    <description>When the grain was threshed, it was winnowed by being thrown up against the wind (<reflink target="XXX">Jer. 4:11</reflink>), and afterwards tossed with wooden scoops (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 30:24</reflink>). The shovel and the fan for winnowing are mentioned in Ps. 35:5, Job 21:18, Isa. 17:13. The refuse of straw and chaff was burned (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 5:24</reflink>). Freed from impurities, the grain was then laid up in granaries till used (<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 28:8; Prov. 3:10; Matt. 6:26; 13:30; Luke 12:18</reflink>).</description>

  <item id="Agrippa I">
    <description>the grandson of Herod the Great, and son of Aristobulus and Bernice. The Roman emperor Caligula made him governor first of the territories of Philip, then of the tetrarchy of Lysanias, with the title of king ("king Herod"), and finally of that of Antipas, who was banished, and of Samaria and Judea. Thus he became ruler over the whole of Palestine. He was a persecutor of the early Christians. He slew James, and imprisoned Peter (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 12:1-4</reflink>). He died at Caesarea, being "eaten of worms" (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 12:23</reflink>), A.D. 44. (Comp. Josephus, Ant. xix. 8.)</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Agrippa II">
    <description>son of the foregoing, was born at Rome, A.D. 27. He was the brother of Bernice and Drusilla. The Emperor Claudius (A.D. 48) invested him with the office of superintendent of the Temple of Jerusalem, and made him governor (A.D. 50) of Chalcis. He was afterwards raised to the rank of king, and made governor over the tetrarchy of Philip and Lysanias (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 25:13; 26:2, 7</reflink>). It was before him that Paul delivered (A.D. 59) his speech recorded in Acts 26. His private life was very profligate. He died (the last of his race) at Rome, at the age of about seventy years, A.D. 100.</description>

  <item id="Ague">
    <description>the translation in Lev. 26:16 (R.V., "fever") of the Hebrew word kaddah'ath, meaning "kindling", i.e., an inflammatory or burning fever. In Deut. 28:22 the word is rendered "fever."</description>

  </item>
  <item id="Aha!">
    <description>an exclamation of ridicule (<reflink target="XXX">Ps. 35:21; 40:15; 70:3</reflink>). In Isa. 44:16 it signifies joyful surprise, as also in Job 39:25, R.V.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Ahab">
    <description>father's brother. (1.) The son of Omri, whom he succeeded as the seventh king of Israel. His history is recorded in 1 Kings 16-22. His wife was Jezebel (q.v.), who exercised a very evil influence over him. To the calf-worship introduced by Jeroboam he added the worship of Baal. He was severely admonished by Elijah (q.v.) for his wickedness. His anger was on this account kindled against the prophet, and he sought to kill him. He undertook three campaigns against Ben-hadad II., king of Damascus. In the first two, which were defensive, he gained a complete victory over Ben-hadad, who fell into his hands, and was afterwards released on the condition of his restoring all the cities of Israel he then held, and granting certain other concessions to Ahab. After three years of peace, for some cause Ahab renewed war (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 22:3</reflink>) with Ben-hadad by assaulting the city of Ramoth-gilead, although the prophet Micaiah warned him that he would not succeed, and that the 400 false prophets who encouraged him were only leading him to his ruin. Micaiah was imprisoned for thus venturing to dissuade Ahab from his purpose. Ahab went into the battle disguised, that he might if possible escape the notice of his enemies; but an arrow from a bow "drawn at a venture" pierced him, and though stayed up in his chariot for a time he died towards evening, and Elijah's prophecy (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 21:19</reflink>) was fulfilled. He reigned twenty-three years. Because of his idolatry, lust, and covetousness, Ahab is referred to as pre-eminently the type of a wicked king (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 8:18; 2 Chr. 22:3; Micah 6:16</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(2.) A false prophet referred to by Jeremiah (<reflink target="XXX">Jer. 29:21</reflink>), of whom nothing further is known.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Ahasuerus">
    <description>There are three kings designated by this name in Scripture. (1.) The father of Darius the Mede, mentioned in Dan. 9:1. This was probably the Cyaxares I. known by this name in profane history, the king of Media and the conqueror of Nineveh.</description>
    <description>(2.) The king mentioned in Ezra 4:6, probably the Cambyses of profane history, the son and successor of Cyrus (B.C. 529).</description>
    <description>(3.) The son of Darius Hystaspes, the king named in the Book of Esther. He ruled over the kingdoms of Persia, Media, and Babylonia, "from India to Ethiopia." This was in all probability the Xerxes of profane history, who succeeded his father Darius (B.C. 485). In the LXX. version of the Book of Esther the name Artaxerxes occurs for Ahasuerus. He reigned for twenty-one years (B.C. 486-465). He invaded Greece with an army, it is said, of more than 2,000,000 soldiers, only 5,000 of whom returned with him. Leonidas, with his famous 300, arrested his progress at the Pass of Thermopylae, and then he was defeated disastrously by Themistocles at Salamis. It was after his return from this invasion that Esther was chosen as his queen.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Ahava">
    <description>water, the river (<reflink target="XXX">Ezra 8:21</reflink>) by the banks of which the Jewish exiles assembled under Ezra when about to return to Jerusalem from Babylon. In all probability this was one of the streams of Mesopotamia which flowed into the Euphrates somewhere in the north-west of Babylonia. It has, however, been supposed to be the name of a place (<reflink target="XXX">Ezra 8:15</reflink>) now called Hit, on the Euphrates, east of Damascus.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Ahaz">
    <description>possessor. (1.) A grandson of Jonathan (<reflink target="XXX">1 Chr. 8:35; 9:42</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(2.) The son and successor of Jotham, king of Judah (2 Kings 16; Isa. 7-9; 2 Chr. 28). He gave himself up to a life of wickedness and idolatry. Notwithstanding the remonstrances and warnings of Isaiah, Hosea, and Micah, he appealed for help against Rezin, king of Damascus, and Pekah, king of Israel, who threatened Jerusalem, to Tiglath-pileser, the king of Assyria, to the great injury of his kingdom and his own humilating subjection to the Assyrians (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 16:7, 9; 15:29</reflink>). He also introduced among his people many heathen and idolatrous customs (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 8:19; 38:8; 2 Kings 23:12</reflink>). He died at the age of thirty-five years, after reigning sixteen years (B.C. 740-724), and was succeeded by his son Hezekiah. Because of his wickedness he was "not brought into the sepulchre of the kings."</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Ahaziah">
    <description>held by Jehovah. (1.) The son and successor of Ahab. He followed the counsels of his mother Jezebel, and imitated in wickedness the ways of his father. In his reign the Moabites revolted from under his authority (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 3:5-7</reflink>). He united with Jehoshaphat in an attempt to revive maritime trade by the Red Sea, which proved a failure (<reflink target="XXX">2 Chr. 20:35-37</reflink>). His messengers, sent to consult the god of Ekron regarding his recovery from the effects of a fall from the roof-gallery of his palace, were met on the way by Elijah, who sent them back to tell the king that he would never rise from his bed (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 22:51; 2 Kings 1:18</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(2.) The son of Joram, or Jehoram, and sixth king of Judah. Called Jehoahaz (<reflink target="XXX">2 Chr. 21:17; 25:23</reflink>), and Azariah (<reflink target="XXX">2 Chr. 22:6</reflink>). Guided by his idolatrous mother Athaliah, his reign was disastrous (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 8:24-29; 9:29</reflink>). He joined his uncle Jehoram, king of Israel, in an expedition against Hazael, king of Damascus; but was wounded at the pass of Gur when attempting to escape, and had strength only to reach Megiddo, where he died (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 9:22-28</reflink>). He reigned only one year.</description>

    <description>(2.) One of the five sons of Jerahmeel, who was great-grandson of Judah (<reflink target="XXX">1 Chr. 2:25</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(3.) Son of Ahitub (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 14:3, 18</reflink>), Ichabod's brother; the same probably as Ahimelech, who was high priest at Nob in the reign of Saul (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 22:11</reflink>). Some, however, suppose that Ahimelech was the brother of Ahijah, and that they both officiated as high priests, Ahijah at Gibeah or Kirjath-jearim, and Ahimelech at Nob.</description>
    <description>(4.) A Pelonite, one of David's heroes (<reflink target="XXX">1 Chr. 11:36</reflink>); called also Eliam (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 23:34</reflink>).</description>

    <description>(7.) A prophet of Shiloh (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 11:29; 14:2</reflink>), called the "Shilonite," in the days of Rehoboam. We have on record two of his remarkable prophecies, 1 Kings 11:31-39, announcing the rending of the ten tribes from Solomon; and 1 Kings 14:6-16, delivered to Jeroboam's wife, foretelling the death of Abijah the king's son, the destruction of Jeroboam's house, and the captivity of Israel "beyond the river." Jeroboam bears testimony to the high esteem in which he was held as a prophet of God (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 14:2,3</reflink>).</description>

  <item id="Ahikam">
    <description>brother of support = helper, one of the five whom Josiah sent to consult the prophetess Huldah in connection with the discovery of the book of the law (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 22:12-14; 2 Chr. 34:20</reflink>). He was the son of Shaphan, the royal secretary, and the father of Gedaliah, governor of Judea after the destruction of Jerusalem by the Babylonians (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 25:22; Jer. 40:5-16; 43:6</reflink>). On one occasion he protected Jeremiah against the fury of Jehoiakim (<reflink target="XXX">Jer. 26:24</reflink>). It was in the chamber of another son (Germariah) of Shaphan that Baruch read in the ears of all the people Jeremiah's roll.</description>

    <description>brother of anger = irascible. (1.) The father Ahinoam, the wife of Saul (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 14:50</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(2.) The son and successor of Zadok in the office of high priest (<reflink target="XXX">1 Chr. 6:8, 53</reflink>). On the occasion of the revolt of Absalom he remained faithful to David, and was of service to him in conveying to him tidings of the proceedings of Absalom in Jerusalem (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 15:24-37; 17:15-21</reflink>). He was swift of foot, and was the first to carry to David tidings of the defeat of Absalom, although he refrained, from delicacy of feeling, from telling him of his death (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 18:19-33</reflink>).</description>

  <item id="Ahiman">
    <description>brother of a gift = liberal. (1.) One of the three giant Anakim brothers whom Caleb and the spies saw in Mount Hebron (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 13:22</reflink>) when they went in to explore the land.

  <item id="Ahimelech">
    <description>brother of the king, the son of Ahitub and father of Abiathar (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 22:20-23</reflink>). He descended from Eli in the line of Ithamar. In 1 Chr. 18:16 he is called Abimelech, and is probably the same as Ahiah (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 14:3, 18</reflink>). He was the twelfth high priest, and officiated at Nob, where he was visited by David (to whom and his companions he gave five loaves of the showbread) when he fled from Saul (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 21:1-9</reflink>). He was summoned into Saul's presence, and accused, on the information of Doeg the Edomite, of disloyalty because of his kindness to David; whereupon the king commanded that he, with the other priests who stood beside him (86 in all), should be put to death. This sentence was carried into execution by Doeg in the most cruel manner (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 22:9-23</reflink>). Possibly Abiathar had a son also called Ahimelech, or the two names, as some think, may have been accidentally transposed in 2 Sam. 8:17; 1 Chr. 18:16, marg.; 24:3, 6, 31.</description>

David sent his old friend Hushai back to Absalom, in order that he might counteract the counsel of Ahithophel (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 15:31-37</reflink>). This end was so far gained that Ahithophel saw he had no longer any influence, and accordingly he at once left the camp of Absalom and returned to Giloh, his native place, where, after arranging his wordly affairs, he hanged himself, and was buried in the sepulchre of his fathers (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 17:1-23</reflink>). He was the type of Judas (<reflink target="XXX">Ps. 41:9</reflink>).</description>

  <item id="Ai">
    <description>ruins. (1.) One of the royal cities of the Canaanites (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 10:1; Gen. 12:8; 13:3</reflink>).

It lay rebuilt and inhibited by the Benjamites (<reflink target="XXX">Ezra 2:28; Neh. 7:32; 11:31</reflink>). It lay to the east of Bethel, "beside Beth-aven."

It lay up the Wady Suweinit, a steep, rugged valley, extending from the Jordan valley to Bethel.</description>

It was one of the Levitical cities given to the Kohathites (<reflink target="XXX">1 Chr. 6:69</reflink>). It was not far from Beth-shemesh (<reflink target="XXX">2 Chr. 28:18</reflink>). It was the boundary between the kingdoms of Judah and Israel, and is frequently mentioned in Jewish history (<reflink target="XXX">2 Chr. 11:10; 1 Sam. 14:31; 1 Chr. 8:13</reflink>). With reference to the valley named after the town, Joshua uttered the celebrated command, "Sun, stand thou still on Gibeon; and thou, Moon, in the valley of Ajalon" (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 10:12</reflink>). It has been identified as the modern Yalo, at the foot of the Beth-horon pass (q.v.). In the Tell Amarna letters Adoni-zedek (q.v.) speaks of the destruction of the "city of Ajalon" by the invaders, and describes himself as "afflicted, greatly afflicted" by the calamities that had come on the land, urging the king of Egypt to hasten to his help.</description>
    <description>(2.) A city in the tribe of Zebulun (<reflink target="XXX">Judg. 12:12</reflink>), the modern Jalun, three miles north of Cabul.</description>

  <item id="Akkub">
    <description>(another form of Jacob). (1.) The head of one of the families of Nethinim (<reflink target="XXX">Ezra 2:45</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(2.) A Levite who kept the gate of the temple after the return from Babylon (<reflink target="XXX">1 Chr. 9:17; Ezra 2:42; Neh. 7:45</reflink>).</description>

  <item id="Akrabbim">
    <description>scorpions, probably the general name given to the ridge containing the pass between the south of the Dead Sea and Zin, es-Sufah, by which there is an ascent to the level of the land of Palestine. Scorpions are said to abound in this whole district, and hence the name (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 34:4</reflink>). It is called "Maaleh-acrabbim" in Josh. 15:3, and "the ascent of Akrabbim" in Num. 34:4.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Alabaster">
    <description>occurs only in the New Testament in connection with the box of "ointment of spikenard very precious," with the contents of which a woman anointed the head of Jesus as he sat at supper in the house of Simon the leper (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 26:7; Mark 14:3; Luke 7:37</reflink>). These boxes were made from a stone found near Alabastron in Egypt, and from this circumstance the Greeks gave them the name of the city where they were made. The name was then given to the stone of which they were made; and finally to all perfume vessels, of whatever material they were formed. The woman "broke" the vessel; i.e., she broke off, as was usually done, the long and narrow neck so as to reach the contents. This stone resembles marble, but is softer in its texture, and hence very easily wrought into boxes. Mark says (14:5) that this box of ointment was worth more than 300 pence, i.e., denarii, each of the value of sevenpence halfpenny of our money, and therefore worth about 10 pounds. But if we take the denarius as the day's wage of a labourer (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 20:2</reflink>), say two shillings of our money, then the whole would be worth about 30 pounds, so costly was Mary's offering.</description>

  <item id="Alarm">
    <description>a particular quivering sound of the silver trumpets to give warning to the Hebrews on their journey through the wilderness (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 10:5, 6</reflink>), a call to arms, or a war-note (<reflink target="XXX">Jer. 4:19; 49:2; Zeph. 1:16</reflink>).</description>

    <description>(3.) A Jew of Ephesus who took a prominent part in the uproar raised there by the preaching of Paul (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 19:33</reflink>). The Jews put him forward to plead their cause before the mob. It was probably intended that he should show that he and the other Jews had no sympathy with Paul any more than the Ephesians had. It is possible that this man was the same as the following.</description>
    <description>(4.) A coppersmith who, with Hymenaeus and others, promulgated certain heresies regarding the resurrection (<reflink target="XXX">1 Tim. 1:19; 2 Tim. 4:14</reflink>), and made shipwreck of faith and of a good conscience. Paul excommunicated him (<reflink target="XXX">1 Tim. 1:20; comp. 1 Cor. 5:5</reflink>).</description>

  <item id="Alexander the Great">
    <description>the king of Macedonia, the great conqueror; probably represented in Daniel by the "belly of brass" (<reflink target="XXX">Dan. 2:32</reflink>), and the leopard and the he-goat (7:6; 11:3,4). He succeeded his father Philip, and died at the age of thirty-two from the effects of intemperance, B.C. 323. His empire was divided among his four generals.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Alexandria">
    <description>the ancient metropolis of Lower Egypt, so called from its founder, Alexander the Great (about B.C. 333). It was for a long period the greatest of existing cities, for both Nineveh and Babylon had been destroyed, and Rome had not yet risen to greatness. It was the residence of the kings of Egypt for 200 years. It is not mentioned in the Old Testament, and only incidentally in the New. Apollos, eloquent and mighty in the Scriptures, was a native of this city (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 18:24</reflink>). Many Jews from Alexandria were in Jerusalem, where they had a synagogue (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 6:9</reflink>), at the time of Stephen's martyrdom. At one time it is said that as many as 10,000 Jews resided in this city. It possessed a famous library of 700,000 volumes, which was burned by the Saracens (A.D. 642). It was here that the Hebrew Bible was translated into Greek. This is called the Septuagint version, from the tradition that seventy learned men were engaged in executing it. It was, however, not all translated at one time. It was begun B.C. 280, and finished about B.C. 200 or 150. (<see target="x-self">See VERSION.</see>)</description>

  <item id="Alien">
    <description>a foreigner, or person born in another country, and therefore not entitled to the rights and privileges of the country where he resides. Among the Hebrews there were two classes of aliens.</description>
    <description>(1.) Those who were strangers generally, and who owned no landed property.</description>
    <description>(2.) Strangers dwelling in another country without being naturalized (<reflink target="XXX">Lev. 22:10; Ps. 39:12</reflink>).</description>
    <description>Both of these classes were to enjoy, under certain conditions, the same rights as other citizens (<reflink target="XXX">Lev. 19:33, 34; Deut. 10:19</reflink>). They might be naturalized and permitted to enter into the congregation of the Lord by submitting to circumcision and abandoning idolatry (<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 23:3-8</reflink>).</description>
    <description>This term is used (<reflink target="XXX">Eph. 2:12</reflink>) to denote persons who have no interest in Christ.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Allegory">
    <description>used only in Gal. 4:24, where the apostle refers to the history of Isaac the free-born, and Ishmael the slave-born, and makes use of it allegorically.</description>
    <description>Every parable is an allegory. Nathan (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 12:1-4</reflink>) addresses David in an allegorical narrative. In the eightieth Psalm there is a beautiful allegory: "Thou broughtest a vine out of Egypt," etc. In Eccl. 12:2-6, there is a striking allegorical description of old age.</description>

  <item id="Alleluia">
    <description>the Greek form (<reflink target="XXX">Rev. 19:1, 3, 4, 6</reflink>) of the Hebrew Hallelujah = Praise ye Jehovah, which begins or ends several of the psalms (106, 111, 112, 113, etc.).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Alliance">
    <description>a treaty between nations, or between individuals, for their mutual advantage.</description>
    <description>Abraham formed an alliance with some of the Canaanitish princes (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 14:13</reflink>), also with Abimelech (21:22-32). Joshua and the elders of Israel entered into an alliance with the Gibeonites (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 9:3-27</reflink>). When the Israelites entered Palestine they were forbidden to enter into alliances with the inhabitants of the country (<reflink target="XXX">Lev. 18:3, 4; 20:22, 23</reflink>).</description>
    <description>Solomon formed a league with Hiram (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 5:12</reflink>). This "brotherly covenant" is referred to 250 years afterwards (<reflink target="XXX">Amos 1:9</reflink>). He also appears to have entered into an alliance with Pharaoh (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 10:28, 29</reflink>).</description>
    <description>In the subsequent history of the kingdoms of Judah and Israel various alliances were formed between them and also with neighbouring nations at different times.</description>
    <description>From patriarchal times a covenant of alliance was sealed by the blood of some sacrificial victim. The animal sacrificed was cut in two (except birds), and between these two parts the persons contracting the alliance passed (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 15:10</reflink>). There are frequent allusions to this practice (<reflink target="XXX">Jer. 34:18</reflink>). Such alliances were called "covenants of salt" (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 18:19; 2 Chr. 13:5</reflink>), salt being the symbol of perpetuity. A pillar was set up as a memorial of the alliance between Laban and Jacob (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 31:52</reflink>). The Jews throughout their whole history attached great importance to fidelity to their engagements. Divine wrath fell upon the violators of them (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 9:18; 2 Sam. 21:1, 2; Ezek. 17:16</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Allon">
    <description>oak. (1.) The expression in the Authorized Version of Josh. 19:33, "from Allon to Zaanannim," is more correctly rendered in the Revised Version, "from the oak in Zaanannim." The word denotes some remarkable tree which stood near Zaanannim, and which served as a landmark.</description>
    <description>(2.) The son of Jedaiah, of the family of the Simeonites, who expelled the Hamites from the valley of Gedor (<reflink target="XXX">1 Chr. 4:37</reflink>).</description>

  <item id="Allon-bachuth">
    <description>oak of weeping, a tree near Bethel, at the spot where Deborah, Rebekah's nurse, was buried (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 35:8</reflink>). Large trees, from their rarity in the plains of Palestine, were frequently designated as landmarks. This particular tree was probably the same as the "palm tree of Deborah" (<reflink target="XXX">Judg. 4:5</reflink>).</description>

  </item>
  <item id="Almond">
    <description>a native of Syria and Palestine. In form, blossoms, and fruit it resembles the peach tree. Its blossoms are of a very pale pink colour, and appear before its leaves. Its Hebrew name, _shaked_, signifying "wakeful, hastening," is given to it on account of its putting forth its blossoms so early, generally in February, and sometimes even in January. In Eccl. 12:5, it is referred to as illustrative, probably, of the haste with which old age comes. There are others, however, who still contend for the old interpretation here. "The almond tree bears its blossoms in the midst of winter, on a naked, leafless stem, and these blossoms (reddish or flesh-coloured in the beginning) seem at the time of their fall exactly like white snow-flakes. In this way the almond blossom is a very fitting symbol of old age, with its silvery hair and its wintry, dry, barren, unfruitful condition." In Jer. 1:11 "I see a rod of an almond tree [shaked]...for I will hasten [shaked] my word to perform it" the word is used as an emblem of promptitude. Jacob desired his sons (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 43:11</reflink>) to take with them into Egypt of the best fruits of the land, almonds, etc., as a present to Joseph, probably because this tree was not a native of Egypt. Aaron's rod yielded almonds (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 17:8; Heb. 9:4</reflink>). Moses was directed to make certain parts of the candlestick for the ark of carved work "like unto almonds" (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 25:33, 34</reflink>). The Hebrew word _luz_, translated "hazel" in the Authorized Version (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 30:37</reflink>), is rendered in the Revised Version "almond." It is probable that _luz_ denotes the wild almond, while _shaked_ denotes the cultivated variety.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Alms">
    <description>Not found in the Old Testament, but repeatedly in the New. The Mosaic legislation (<reflink target="XXX">Lev. 25:35; Deut. 15:7</reflink>) tended to promote a spirit of charity, and to prevent the occurrence of destitution among the people. Such passages as these, Ps. 41:1; 112:9; Prov. 14:31; Isa. 10:2; Amos 2:7; Jer. 5:28; Ezek. 22:29, would also naturally foster the same benevolent spirit.</description>
    <description>In the time of our Lord begging was common (<reflink target="XXX">Mark 10:46; Acts 3:2</reflink>). The Pharisees were very ostentatious in their almsgivings (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 6:2</reflink>). The spirit by which the Christian ought to be actuated in this duty is set forth in 1 John 3:17. A regard to the state of the poor and needy is enjoined as a Christian duty (<reflink target="XXX">Luke 3:11; 6:30; Matt. 6:1; Acts 9:36; 10:2, 4</reflink>), a duty which was not neglected by the early Christians (<reflink target="XXX">Luke 14:13; Acts 20:35; Gal. 2:10; Rom. 15:25-27; 1 Cor. 16:1-4</reflink>). They cared not only for the poor among themselves, but contributed also to the necessities of those at a distance (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 11:29; 24:17; 2 Cor. 9:12</reflink>). Our Lord and his attendants showed an example also in this (<reflink target="XXX">John 13:29</reflink>).</description>
    <description>In modern times the "poor-laws" have introduced an element which modifies considerably the form in which we may discharge this Christian duty.</description>

  <item id="Almug">
    <description>(<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 10:11, 12</reflink>) = algum (<reflink target="XXX">2 Chr. 2:8; 9:10, 11</reflink>), in the Hebrew occurring only in the plural _almuggim_ (indicating that the wood was brought in planks), the name of a wood brought from Ophir to be used in the building of the temple, and for other purposes. Some suppose it to have been the white sandal-wood of India, the Santalum album of botanists, a native of the mountainous parts of the Malabar coasts. It is a fragrant wood, and is used in China for incense in idol-worship. Others, with some probability, think that it was the Indian red sandal-wood, the pterocarpus santalinus, a heavy, fine-grained wood, the Sanscrit name of which is valguka. It is found on the Coromandel coast and in Ceylon.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Aloes">
    <description>(Heb. 'ahalim), a fragrant wood (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 24:6; Ps. 45:8; Prov. 7:17; Cant. 4:14</reflink>), the Aquilaria agallochum of botanists, or, as some suppose, the costly gum or perfume extracted from the wood. It is found in China, Siam, and Northern India, and grows to the height sometimes of 120 feet. This species is of great rarity even in India. There is another and more common species, called by Indians aghil, whence Europeans have given it the name of Lignum aquile, or eagle-wood. Aloewood was used by the Egyptians for embalming dead bodies. Nicodemus brought it (pounded aloe-wood) to embalm the body of Christ (<reflink target="XXX">John 19:39</reflink>); but whether this was the same as that mentioned elsewhere is uncertain.</description>
    <description>The bitter aloes of the apothecary is the dried juice of the leaves Aloe vulgaris.</description>

  <item id="Alphaeus">
    <description>(1.) The father of James the Less, the apostle and writer of the epistle (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 10:3; Mark 3:18; Luke 6:15; Acts 1:13</reflink>), and the husband of Mary (<reflink target="XXX">John 19:25</reflink>). The Hebrew form of this name is Cleopas, or Clopas (q.v.).</description>
    <description>(2.) The father of Levi, or Matthew (<reflink target="XXX">Mark 2:14</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Altar">
    <description>(Heb. mizbe'ah, from a word meaning "to slay"), any structure of earth (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 20:24</reflink>) or unwrought stone (20:25) on which sacrifices were offered. Altars were generally erected in conspicuous places (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 22:9; Ezek. 6:3; 2 Kings 23:12; 16:4; 23:8; Acts 14:13</reflink>). The word is used in Heb. 13:10 for the sacrifice offered upon it--the sacrifice Christ offered.</description>
    <description>Paul found among the many altars erected in Athens one bearing the inscription, "To the unknown God" (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 17:23</reflink>), or rather "to an [i.e., some] unknown God." The reason for this inscription cannot now be accurately determined. It afforded the apostle the occasion of proclaiming the gospel to the "men of Athens."</description>
    <description>The first altar we read of is that erected by Noah (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 8:20</reflink>). Altars were erected by Abraham (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 12:7; 13:4; 22:9</reflink>), by Isaac (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 26:25</reflink>), by Jacob (33:20; 35:1, 3), and by Moses (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 17:15, "Jehovah-nissi"</reflink>).</description>
    <description>In the tabernacle, and afterwards in the temple, two altars were erected.</description>
    <description>(1.) The altar of burnt offering (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 30:28</reflink>), called also the "brasen altar" (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 39:39</reflink>) and "the table of the Lord" (<reflink target="XXX">Mal. 1:7</reflink>).</description>
    <description>This altar, as erected in the tabernacle, is described in Ex. 27:1-8. It was a hollow square, 5 cubits in length and in breadth, and 3 cubits in height. It was made of shittim wood, and was overlaid with plates of brass. Its corners were ornamented with "horns" (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 29:12; Lev. 4:18</reflink>).</description>
    <description>In Ex. 27:3 the various utensils appertaining to the altar are enumerated. They were made of brass. (Comp. 1 Sam. 2:13, 14; Lev. 16:12; Num. 16:6, 7.)</description>
    <description>In Solomon's temple the altar was of larger dimensions (<reflink target="XXX">2 Chr. 4:1. Comp. 1 Kings 8:22, 64; 9:25</reflink>), and was made wholly of brass, covering a structure of stone or earth. This altar was renewed by Asa (<reflink target="XXX">2 Chr. 15:8</reflink>). It was removed by Ahaz (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 16:14</reflink>), and "cleansed" by Hezekiah, in the latter part of whose reign it was rebuilt. It was finally broken up and carried away by the Babylonians (<reflink target="XXX">Jer. 52:17</reflink>).</description>
    <description>After the return from captivity it was re-erected (<reflink target="XXX">Ezra 3:3, 6</reflink>) on the same place where it had formerly stood. (Comp. 1 Macc. 4:47.) When Antiochus Epiphanes pillaged Jerusalem the altar of burnt offering was taken away.</description>
    <description>Again the altar was erected by Herod, and remained in its place till the destruction of Jerusalem by the Romans (70 A.D.).</description>
    <description>The fire on the altar was not permitted to go out (<reflink target="XXX">Lev. 6:9</reflink>).</description>
    <description>In the Mosque of Omar, immediately underneath the great dome, which occupies the site of the old temple, there is a rough projection of the natural rock, of about 60 feet in its extreme length, and 50 in its greatest breadth, and in its highest part about 4 feet above the general pavement. This rock seems to have been left intact when Solomon's temple was built. It was in all probability the site of the altar of burnt offering. Underneath this rock is a cave, which may probably have been the granary of Araunah's threshing-floor (<reflink target="XXX">1 Chr. 21:22</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(2.) The altar of incense (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 30:1-10</reflink>), called also "the golden altar" (39:38; Num. 4:11), stood in the holy place "before the vail that is by the ark of the testimony." On this altar sweet spices were continually burned with fire taken from the brazen altar. The morning and the evening services were commenced by the high priest offering incense on this altar. The burning of the incense was a type of prayer (<reflink target="XXX">Ps. 141:2; Rev. 5:8; 8:3, 4</reflink>).</description>
    <description>This altar was a small movable table, made of acacia wood overlaid with gold (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 37:25, 26</reflink>). It was 1 cubit in length and breadth, and 2 cubits in height.</description>
    <description>In Solomon's temple the altar was similar in size, but was made of cedar-wood (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 6:20; 7:48</reflink>) overlaid with gold. In Ezek. 41:22 it is called "the altar of wood." (<reflink target="XXX">Comp. Ex. 30:1-6.</reflink>)</description>
    <description>In the temple built after the Exile the altar was restored. Antiochus Epiphanes took it away, but it was afterwards restored by Judas Maccabaeus (<reflink target="XXX">1 Macc. 1:23; 4:49</reflink>). Among the trophies carried away by Titus on the destruction of Jerusalem the altar of incense is not found, nor is any mention made of it in Heb. 9. It was at this altar Zacharias ministered when an angel appeared to him (<reflink target="XXX">Luke 1:11</reflink>). It is the only altar which appears in the heavenly temple (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 6:6; Rev. 8:3,4</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Altaschith">

    <description>one of the places, the last before Rephidim, at which the Hebrews rested on their way to Sinai (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 33:13, 14</reflink>). It was probably situated on the shore of the Red Sea.</description>

His mother was a Horite, a tribe whose territory the descendants of Esau had seized.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Amalekite">
    <description>a tribe that dwelt in Arabia Petraea, between the Dead Sea and the Red Sea. They were not the descendants of Amalek, the son of Eliphaz, for they existed in the days of Abraham (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 14:7</reflink>). They were probably a tribe that migrated from the shores of the Persian Gulf and settled in Arabia. "They dwelt in the land of the south...from Havilah until thou comest to Shur" (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 13:29; 1 Sam. 15:7</reflink>). They were a pastoral, and hence a nomadic race. Their kings bore the hereditary name of Agag (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 24:7; 1 Sam. 15:8</reflink>). They attempted to stop the Israelites when they marched through their territory (<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 25:18</reflink>), attacking them at Rephidim (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 17:8-13; comp. Deut. 25:17; 1 Sam. 15:2</reflink>). They afterwards attacked the Israelites at Hormah (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 14:45</reflink>). We read of them subsequently as in league with the Moabites (<reflink target="XXX">Judg. 3:13</reflink>) and the Midianites (<reflink target="XXX">Judg. 6:3</reflink>). Saul finally desolated their territory and destroyed their power (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 14:48; 15:3</reflink>), and David recovered booty from them (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 30:18-20</reflink>). In the Babylonian inscriptions they are called Sute, in those of Egypt Sittiu, and the Amarna tablets include them under the general name of Khabbati, or "plunderers."</description>

    <description>burden. (1.) The son of Abigail, a sister of king David (<reflink target="XXX">1 Chr. 2:17; 2 Sam. 17:25</reflink>). He was appointed by David to command the army in room of his cousin Joab (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 19:13</reflink>), who afterwards treacherously put him to death as a dangerous rival (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 20:4-12</reflink>).</description>

    <description>strengthened by Jehovah. (1.) A Levite, son of Hilkiah, of the descendants of Ethan the Merarite (<reflink target="XXX">1 Chr. 6:45</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(2.) The son and successor of Joash, and eighth king of the separate kingdom of Judah (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 14:1-4</reflink>). He began his reign by punishing the murderers of his father (5-7; 2 Chr. 25:3-5). He was the first to employ a mercenary army of 100,000 Israelite soldiers, which he did in his attempt to bring the Edomites again under the yoke of Judah (<reflink target="XXX">2 Chr. 25:5, 6</reflink>). He was commanded by a prophet of the Lord to send back the mercenaries, which he did (<reflink target="XXX">2 Chr. 25:7-10, 13</reflink>), much to their annoyance. His obedience to this command was followed by a decisive victory over the Edomites (<reflink target="XXX">2 Chr. 25:14-16</reflink>). Amaziah began to worship some of the idols he took from the Edomites, and this was his ruin, for he was vanquished by Joash, king of Israel, whom he challenged to battle. The disaster he thus brought upon Judah by his infatuation in proclaiming war against Israel probably occasioned the conspiracy by which he lost his life (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 14:8-14, 19</reflink>). He was slain at Lachish, whither he had fled, and his body was brought upon horses to Jerusalem, where it was buried in the royal sepulchre (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 14:19, 20; 2 Chr. 25:27, 28</reflink>).</description>

  <item id="Ambassador">
    <description>In the Old Testament the Hebrew word _tsir_, meaning "one who goes on an errand," is rendered thus (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 9:4; Prov. 13:17; Isa. 18:2; Jer. 49:14; Obad. 1:1</reflink>). This is also the rendering of _melits_, meaning "an interpreter," in 2 Chr. 32:31; and of _malak_, a "messenger," in 2 Chr. 35:21; Isa. 30:4; 33:7; Ezek. 17:15. This is the name used by the apostle as designating those who are appointed by God to declare his will (<reflink target="XXX">2 Cor. 5:20; Eph. 6:20</reflink>).</description>
    <description>The Hebrews on various occasions and for various purposes had recourse to the services of ambassadors, e.g., to contract alliances (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 9:4</reflink>), to solicit favours (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 20:14</reflink>), to remonstrate when wrong was done (<reflink target="XXX">Judg. 11:12</reflink>), to condole with a young king on the death of his father (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 10:2</reflink>), and to congratulate a king on his accession to the throne (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 5:1</reflink>).</description>
    <description>To do injury to an ambassador was to insult the king who sent him (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 10:5</reflink>).</description>

  <item id="Amber">
    <description>(<reflink target="XXX">Ezek. 1:4, 27; 8:2. Heb., hashmal, rendered by the LXX. elektron, and by the Vulgate electrum</reflink>), a metal compounded of silver and gold. Some translate the word by "polished brass," others "fine brass," as in Rev. 1:15; 2:18. It was probably the mixture now called electrum. The word has no connection, however, with what is now called amber, which is a gummy substance, reckoned as belonging to the mineral kingdom though of vegetable origin, a fossil resin.</description>

  <item id="Ambush">
    <description>Joshua at the capture of Ai lay in ambush, and so deceived the inhabitants that he gained an easy victory (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 8:4-26</reflink>). Shechem was taken in this manner (<reflink target="XXX">Judg. 9:30-45. Comp. Jer. 51:12</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Amen">
    <description>This Hebrew word means firm, and hence also faithful (<reflink target="XXX">Rev. 3:14</reflink>). In Isa. 65:16, the Authorized Version has "the God of truth," which in Hebrew is "the God of Amen." It is frequently used by our Saviour to give emphasis to his words, where it is translated "verily." Sometimes, only, however, in John's Gospel, it is repeated, "Verily, verily." It is used as an epithet of the Lord Jesus Christ (<reflink target="XXX">Rev. 3:14</reflink>).</description>
    <description>It is found singly and sometimes doubly at the end of prayers (<reflink target="XXX">Ps. 41:13; 72:19; 89:52</reflink>), to confirm the words and invoke the fulfilment of them. It is used in token of being bound by an oath (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 5:22; Deut. 27:15-26; Neh. 5:13; 8:6; 1 Chr. 16:36</reflink>). In the primitive churches it was common for the general audience to say "Amen" at the close of the prayer (<reflink target="XXX">1 Cor. 14:16</reflink>).</description>
    <description>The promises of God are Amen; i.e., they are all true and sure (<reflink target="XXX">2 Cor. 1:20</reflink>).</description>

  <item id="Amethyst">
    <description>one of the precious stones in the breastplate of the high priest (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 28:19; 39:12</reflink>), and in the foundation of the New Jerusalem (<reflink target="XXX">Rev. 21:20</reflink>). The ancients thought that this stone had the power of dispelling drunkenness in all who wore or touched it, and hence its Greek name formed from _a_, "privative," and _methuo_, "to get drunk." Its Jewish name, _ahlamah'_, was derived by the rabbins from the Hebrew word _halam_, "to dream," from its supposed power of causing the wearer to dream.</description>

  </item>
  <item id="Ammonite">
    <description>the usual name of the descendants of Ammon, the son of Lot (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 19:38</reflink>). From the very beginning (<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 2:16-20</reflink>) of their history till they are lost sight of (<reflink target="XXX">Judg. 5:2</reflink>), this tribe is closely associated with the Moabites (<reflink target="XXX">Judg. 10:11; 2 Chr. 20:1; Zeph. 2:8</reflink>). Both of these tribes hired Balaam to curse Israel (<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 23:4</reflink>). The Ammonites were probably more of a predatory tribe, moving from place to place, while the Moabites were more settled. They inhabited the country east of the Jordan and north of Moab and the Dead Sea, from which they had expelled the Zamzummims or Zuzims (<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 2:20; Gen. 14:5</reflink>). They are known as the Beni-ammi (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 19:38</reflink>), Ammi or Ammon being worshipped as their chief god. They were of Semitic origin, and closely related to the Hebrews in blood and language. They showed no kindness to the Israelites when passing through their territory, and therefore they were prohibited from "entering the congregation of the Lord to the tenth generation" (<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 23:3</reflink>). They afterwards became hostile to Israel (<reflink target="XXX">Judg. 3:13</reflink>). Jephthah waged war against them, and "took twenty cities with a very great slaughter" (<reflink target="XXX">Judg. 11:33</reflink>). They were again signally defeated by Saul (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 11:11</reflink>). David also defeated them and their allies the Syrians (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 10:6-14</reflink>), and took their chief city, Rabbah, with much spoil (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 10:14; 12:26-31</reflink>). The subsequent events of their history are noted in 2 Chr. 20:25; 26:8; Jer. 49:1; Ezek. 25:3, 6. One of Solomon's wives was Naamah, an Ammonite. She was the mother of Rehoboam (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 14:31; 2 Chr. 12:13</reflink>).</description>
    <description>The prophets predicted fearful judgments against the Ammonites because of their hostility to Israel (<reflink target="XXX">Zeph. 2:8; Jer. 49:1-6; Ezek. 25:1-5, 10; Amos 1:13-15</reflink>).</description>
    <description>The national idol worshipped by this people was Molech or Milcom, at whose altar they offered human sacrifices (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 11:5, 7</reflink>). The high places built for this idol by Solomon, at the instigation of his Ammonitish wives, were not destroyed till the time of Josiah (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 23:13</reflink>).</description>

  <item id="Amon">
    <description>builder. (1.) The governor of Samaria in the time of Ahab. The prophet Micaiah was committed to his custody (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 22:26; 2 Chr. 18:25</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(2.) The son of Manasseh, and fourteenth king of Judah. He restored idolatry, and set up the images which his father had cast down. Zephaniah (1:4; 3:4, 11) refers to the moral depravity prevailing in this king's reign.</description>
    <description>He was assassinated (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 21:18-26: 2 Chr. 33:20-25</reflink>) by his own servants, who conspired against him.</description>
    <description>(3.) An Egyptian god, usually depicted with a human body and the head of a ram, referred to in Jer. 46:25, where the word "multitudes" in the Authorized Version is more appropriately rendered "Amon" in the Revised Version. In Nah. 3:8 the expression "populous No" of the Authorized version is rendered in the Revised Version "No-amon." Amon is identified with Ra, the sun-god of Heliopolis.</description>
    <description>(4.) Neh. 7:59.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Amorites">
    <description>highlanders, or hillmen, the name given to the descendants of one of the sons of Canaan (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 14:7</reflink>), called Amurra or Amurri in the Assyrian and Egyptian inscriptions. On the early Babylonian monuments all Syria, including Palestine, is known as "the land of the Amorites." The southern slopes of the mountains of Judea are called the "mount of the Amorites" (<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 1:7, 19, 20</reflink>). They seem to have originally occupied the land stretching from the heights west of the Dead Sea (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 14:7</reflink>) to Hebron (<reflink target="XXX">13. Comp. 13:8; Deut. 3:8; 4:46-48</reflink>), embracing "all Gilead and all Bashan" (<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 3:10</reflink>), with the Jordan valley on the east of the river (4:49), the land of the "two kings of the Amorites," Sihon and Og (<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 31:4; Josh. 2:10; 9:10</reflink>). The five kings of the Amorites were defeated with great slaughter by Joshua (10:10). They were again defeated at the waters of Merom by Joshua, who smote them till there were none remaining (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 11:8</reflink>). It is mentioned as a surprising circumstance that in the days of Samuel there was peace between them and the Israelites (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 7:14</reflink>). The discrepancy supposed to exist between Deut. 1:44 and Num. 14:45 is explained by the circumstance that the terms "Amorites" and "Amalekites" are used synonymously for the "Canaanites." In the same way we explain the fact that the "Hivites" of Gen. 34:2 are the "Amorites" of 48:22. Comp. Josh. 10:6; 11:19 with 2 Sam. 21:2; also Num. 14:45 with Deut. 1:44. The Amorites were warlike mountaineers. They are represented on the Egyptian monuments with fair skins, light hair, blue eyes, aquiline noses, and pointed beards. They are supposed to have been men of great stature; their king, Og, is described by Moses as the last "of the remnant of the giants" (<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 3:11</reflink>). Both Sihon and Og were independent kings. Only one word of the Amorite language survives, "Shenir," the name they gave to Mount Hermon (<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 3:9</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Amos">
    <description>borne; a burden, one of the twelve minor prophets. He was a native of Tekota, the modern Tekua, a town about 12 miles south-east of Bethlehem. He was a man of humble birth, neither a "prophet nor a prophet's son," but "an herdman and a dresser of sycomore trees," R.V. He prophesied in the days of Uzziah, king of Judah, and was contemporary with Isaiah and Hosea (<reflink target="XXX">Amos 1:1; 7:14, 15; Zech. 14:5</reflink>), who survived him a few years. Under Jeroboam II. the kingdom of Israel rose to the zenith of its prosperity; but that was followed by the prevalence of luxury and vice and idolatry. At this period Amos was called from his obscurity to remind the people of the law of God's retributive justice, and to call them to repentance.</description>
    <description>The Book of Amos consists of three parts:</description>
    <description>(1.) The nations around are summoned to judgment because of their sins (1:1-2:3). He quotes Joel 3:16.</description>
    <description>(2.) The spiritual condition of Judah, and especially of Israel, is described (2:4-6:14).</description>
    <description>(3.) In 7:1-9:10 are recorded five prophetic visions. (a) The first two (7:1-6) refer to judgments against the guilty people. (b) The next two (7:7-9; 8:1-3) point out the ripeness of the people for the threatened judgements. 7:10-17 consists of a conversation between the prophet and the priest of Bethel. (c) The fifth describes the overthrow and ruin of Israel (9:1-10); to which is added the promise of the restoration of the kingdom and its final glory in the Messiah's kingdom.</description>
    <description>The style is peculiar in the number of the allusions made to natural objects and to agricultural occupations. Other allusions show also that Amos was a student of the law as well as a "child of nature." These phrases are peculiar to him: "Cleanness of teeth" [i.e., want of bread] (4:6); "The excellency of Jacob" (6:8; 8:7); "The high places of Isaac" (7:9); "The house of Isaac" (7:16); "He that createth the wind" (4:13). Quoted, Acts 7:42.</description>

  <item id="Anakim">
    <description>the descendants of Anak (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 11:21; Num. 13:33; Deut. 9:2</reflink>). They dwelt in the south of Palestine, in the neighbourhood of Hebron (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 23:2; Josh. 15:13</reflink>). In the days of Abraham (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 14:5, 6</reflink>) they inhabited the region afterwards known as Edom and Moab, east of the Jordan. They were probably a remnant of the original inhabitants of Palestine before the Canaanites, a Cushite tribe from Babel, and of the same race as the Phoenicians and the Egyptian shepherd kings. Their formidable warlike appearance, as described by the spies sent to search the land, filled the Israelites with terror. They seem to have identified them with the Nephilim, the "giants" (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 6:4; Num. 13:33</reflink>) of the antediluvian age. There were various tribes of Anakim (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 15:14</reflink>). Joshua finally expelled them from the land, except a remnant that found a refuge in the cities of Gaza, Gath, and Ashdod (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 11:22</reflink>). The Philistine giants whom David encountered (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 21:15-22</reflink>) were descendants of the Anakim. (<see target="x-self">See GIANTS.</see>)</description>

  <item id="Anammelech">
    <description>one of the gods worshipped by the people of Sepharvaim, who colonized Samaria (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 17:31</reflink>). The name means "Anu is king." It was a female deity representing the moon, as Adrammelech (q.v.) was the male representing the sun.</description>

  <item id="Anan">
    <description>cloud, one of the Israelites who sealed the covenant after the return from Babylon (<reflink target="XXX">Neh. 10:26</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Ananiah">
    <description>protected by Jehovah, the name of a town in the tribe of Benjamin between Nob and Hazor (<reflink target="XXX">Neh. 11:32</reflink>). It is probably the modern Beit Hanina, a small village 3 miles north of Jerusalem.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Ananias">
    <description>a common Jewish name, the same as Hananiah. (1.) One of the members of the church at Jerusalem, who conspired with his wife Sapphira to deceive the brethren, and who fell down and immediately expired after he had uttered the falsehood (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 5:5</reflink>). By common agreement the members of the early Christian community devoted their property to the work of furthering the gospel and of assisting the poor and needy. The proceeds of the possessions they sold were placed at the disposal of the apostles (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 4:36, 37</reflink>). Ananias might have kept his property had he so chosen; but he professed agreement with the brethren in the common purpose, and had of his own accord devoted it all, as he said, to these sacred ends. Yet he retained a part of it for his own ends, and thus lied in declaring that he had given it all. "The offence of Ananias and Sapphira showed contempt of God, vanity and ambition in the offenders, and utter disregard of the corruption which they were bringing into the society. Such sin, committed in despite of the light which they possessed, called for a special mark of divine indignation."</description>
    <description>(2.) A Christian at Damascus (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 9:10</reflink>). He became Paul's instructor; but when or by what means he himself became a Christian we have no information. He was "a devout man according to the law, having a good report of all the Jews which dwelt" at Damascus (22:12).</description>
    <description>(3.) The high priest before whom Paul was brought in the procuratorship of Felix (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 23:2, 5, 24</reflink>). He was so enraged at Paul's noble declaration, "I have lived in all good conscience before God until this day," that he commanded one of his attendants to smite him on the mouth. Smarting under this unprovoked insult, Paul quickly replied, "God shall smite thee, thou whited wall." Being reminded that Ananias was the high priest, to whose office all respect was to be paid, he answered, "I wist not, brethren, that he was the high priest" (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 23:5</reflink>). This expression has occasioned some difficulty, as it is scarcely probable that Paul should have been ignorant of so public a fact. The expression may mean (a) that Paul had at the moment overlooked the honour due to the high priest; or (b), as others think, that Paul spoke ironically, as if he had said, "The high priest breaking the law! God's high priest a tyrant and a lawbreaker! I see a man in white robes, and have heard his voice, but surely it cannot, it ought not to be, the voice of the high priest." (<see target="x-self">See Dr. Lindsay on Acts, _in loco_.</see>) (c) Others think that from defect of sight Paul could not observe that the speaker was the high priest. In all this, however, it may be explained, Paul, with all his excellency, comes short of the example of his divine Master, who, when he was reviled, reviled not again.</description>

  <item id="Anath">
    <description>an answer; i.e., to "prayer", the father of Shamgar, who was one of the judges of Israel (<reflink target="XXX">Judg. 3:31</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Anathema">
    <description>anything laid up or suspended; hence anything laid up in a temple or set apart as sacred. In this sense the form of the word is _anath(ee)ma_, once in plural used in the Greek New Testament, in Luke 21:5, where it is rendered "gifts." In the LXX. the form _anathema_ is generally used as the rendering of the Hebrew word _herem_, derived from a verb which means (1) to consecrate or devote; and (2) to exterminate. Any object so devoted to the Lord could not be redeemed (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 18:14; Lev. 27:28, 29</reflink>); and hence the idea of exterminating connected with the word. The Hebrew verb (haram) is frequently used of the extermination of idolatrous nations. It had a wide range of application. The _anathema_ or _herem_ was a person or thing irrevocably devoted to God (<reflink target="XXX">Lev. 27:21, 28</reflink>); and "none devoted shall be ransomed. He shall surely be put to death" (27:29). The word therefore carried the idea of devoted to destruction (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 21:2, 3; Josh. 6:17</reflink>); and hence generally it meant a thing accursed. In Deut. 7:26 an idol is called a _herem_ = _anathema_, a thing accursed.</description>
    <description>In the New Testament this word always implies execration. In some cases an individual denounces an anathema on himself unless certain conditions are fulfilled (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 23:12, 14, 21</reflink>). "To call Jesus accursed" [anathema] (<reflink target="XXX">1 Cor. 12:3</reflink>) is to pronounce him execrated or accursed. If any one preached another gospel, the apostle says, "let him be accursed" (<reflink target="XXX">Gal. 1:8, 9</reflink>); i.e., let his conduct in so doing be accounted accursed.</description>
    <description>In Rom. 9:3, the expression "accursed" (anathema) from Christ, i.e., excluded from fellowship or alliance with Christ, has occasioned much difficulty. The apostle here does not speak of his wish as a possible thing. It is simply a vehement expression of feeling, showing how strong was his desire for the salvation of his people.</description>
    <description>The anathema in 1 Cor. 16:22 denotes simply that they who love not the Lord are rightly objects of loathing and execration to all holy beings; they are guilty of a crime that merits the severest condemnation; they are exposed to the just sentence of "everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord."</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Anathoth">
    <description>the name of one of the cities of refuge, in the tribe of Benjamin (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 21:18</reflink>). The Jews, as a rule, did not change the names of the towns they found in Palestine; hence this town may be regarded as deriving its name from the goddess Anat. It was the native place of Abiezer, one of David's "thirty" (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 23:27</reflink>), and of Jehu, another of his mighty men (<reflink target="XXX">1 Chr. 12:3</reflink>). It is chiefly notable, however, as the birth-place and usual residence of Jeremiah (<reflink target="XXX">Jer. 1:1; 11:21-23; 29:27; 32:7-9</reflink>). It suffered greatly from the army of Sennacherib, and only 128 men returned to it from the Exile (<reflink target="XXX">Neh. 7:27; Ezra 2:23</reflink>). It lay about 3 miles north of Jerusalem. It has been identified with the small and poor village of 'Anata, containing about 100 inhabitants.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Anchor">
    <description>From Acts 27:29, 30, 40, it would appear that the Roman vessels carried several anchors, which were attached to the stern as well as to the prow. The Roman anchor, like the modern one, had two teeth or flukes. In Heb. 6:19 the word is used metaphorically for that which supports or keeps one steadfast in the time of trial or of doubt. It is an emblem of hope.</description>
    <description>"If you fear, Put all your trust in God: that anchor holds."</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Ancient of Days">
    <description>an expression applied to Jehovah three times in the vision of Daniel (7:9, 13, 22) in the sense of eternal. In contrast with all earthly kings, his days are past reckoning.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Andrew">
    <description>manliness, a Greek name; one of the apostles of our Lord. He was of Bethsaida in Galilee (<reflink target="XXX">John 1:44</reflink>), and was the brother of Simon Peter (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 4:18; 10:2</reflink>). On one occasion John the Baptist, whose disciple he then was, pointing to Jesus, said, "Behold the Lamb of God" (<reflink target="XXX">John 1:40</reflink>); and Andrew, hearing him, immediately became a follower of Jesus, the first of his disciples. After he had been led to recognize Jesus as the Messiah, his first care was to bring also his brother Simon to Jesus. The two brothers seem to have after this pursued for a while their usual calling as fishermen, and did not become the stated attendants of the Lord till after John's imprisonment (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 4:18, 19; Mark 1:16, 17</reflink>). Very little is related of Andrew. He was one of the confidential disciples (<reflink target="XXX">John 6:8; 12:22</reflink>), and with Peter, James, and John inquired of our Lord privately regarding his future coming (<reflink target="XXX">Mark 13:3</reflink>). He was present at the feeding of the five thousand (<reflink target="XXX">John 6:9</reflink>), and he introduced the Greeks who desired to see Jesus (<reflink target="XXX">John 12:22</reflink>); but of his subsequent history little is known. It is noteworthy that Andrew thrice brings others to Christ, (1) Peter; (2) the lad with the loaves; and (3) certain Greeks. These incidents may be regarded as a key to his character.</description>

  <item id="Anem">
    <description>two fountains, a Levitical city in the tribe of Issachar (<reflink target="XXX">1 Chr. 6:73</reflink>). It is also called En-gannim (q.v.) in Josh. 19:21; the modern Jenin.</description>

    <description>(2.) A city of Manasseh given to the Levites of Kohath's family (<reflink target="XXX">1 Chr. 6:70</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Angel">
    <description>a word signifying, both in the Hebrew and Greek, a "messenger," and hence employed to denote any agent God sends forth to execute his purposes. It is used of an ordinary messenger (<reflink target="XXX">Job 1:14: 1 Sam. 11:3; Luke 7:24; 9:52</reflink>), of prophets (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 42:19; Hag. 1:13</reflink>), of priests (<reflink target="XXX">Mal. 2:7</reflink>), and ministers of the New Testament (<reflink target="XXX">Rev. 1:20</reflink>).</description>
    <description>It is also applied to such impersonal agents as the pestilence (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 24:16, 17; 2 Kings 19:35</reflink>), the wind (<reflink target="XXX">Ps. 104:4</reflink>).</description>
    <description>But its distinctive application is to certain heavenly intelligences whom God employs in carrying on his government of the world. The name does not denote their nature but their office as messengers. The appearances to Abraham at Mamre (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 18:2, 22. Comp. 19:1</reflink>), to Jacob at Peniel (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 32:24, 30</reflink>), to Joshua at Gilgal (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 5:13, 15</reflink>), of the Angel of the Lord, were doubtless manifestations of the Divine presence, "foreshadowings of the incarnation," revelations before the "fulness of the time" of the Son of God.</description>
    <description>(1.) The existence and orders of angelic beings can only be discovered from the Scriptures. Although the Bible does not treat of this subject specially, yet there are numerous incidental details that furnish us with ample information. Their personal existence is plainly implied in such passages as Gen. 16:7, 10, 11; Judg. 13:1-21; Matt. 28:2-5; Heb. 1:4, etc.</description>
    <description>These superior beings are very numerous. "Thousand thousands," etc. (<reflink target="XXX">Dan. 7:10; Matt. 26:53; Luke 2:13; Heb. 12:22, 23</reflink>). They are also spoken of as of different ranks in dignity and power (<reflink target="XXX">Zech. 1:9, 11; Dan. 10:13; 12:1; 1 Thess. 4:16; Jude 1:9; Eph. 1:21; Col. 1:16</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(2.) As to their nature, they are spirits (<reflink target="XXX">Heb. 1:14</reflink>), like the soul of man, but not incorporeal. Such expressions as "like the angels" (<reflink target="XXX">Luke 20:36</reflink>), and the fact that whenever angels appeared to man it was always in a human form (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 18:2; 19:1, 10; Luke 24:4; Acts 1:10</reflink>), and the titles that are applied to them ("sons of God," Job 1:6; 38:7; Dan. 3:25; comp. 28) and to men (<reflink target="XXX">Luke 3:38</reflink>), seem all to indicate some resemblance between them and the human race. Imperfection is ascribed to them as creatures (<reflink target="XXX">Job 4:18; Matt. 24:36; 1 Pet. 1:12</reflink>). As finite creatures they may fall under temptation; and accordingly we read of "fallen angels." Of the cause and manner of their "fall" we are wholly ignorant. We know only that "they left their first estate" (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 25:41; Rev. 12:7,9</reflink>), and that they are "reserved unto judgement" (<reflink target="XXX">2 Pet. 2:4</reflink>). When the manna is called "angels' food," this is merely to denote its excellence (<reflink target="XXX">Ps. 78:25</reflink>). Angels never die (<reflink target="XXX">Luke 20:36</reflink>). They are possessed of superhuman intelligence and power (<reflink target="XXX">Mark 13:32; 2 Thess. 1:7; Ps. 103:20</reflink>). They are called "holy" (<reflink target="XXX">Luke 9:26</reflink>), "elect" (<reflink target="XXX">1 Tim. 5:21</reflink>). The redeemed in glory are "like unto the angels" (<reflink target="XXX">Luke 20:36</reflink>). They are not to be worshipped (<reflink target="XXX">Col. 2:18; Rev. 19:10</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(3.) Their functions are manifold. (a) In the widest sense they are agents of God's providence (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 12:23; Ps. 104:4; Heb. 11:28; 1 Cor. 10:10; 2 Sam. 24:16; 1 Chr. 21:16; 2 Kings 19:35; Acts 12:23</reflink>). (b) They are specially God's agents in carrying on his great work of redemption. There is no notice of angelic appearances to man till after the call of Abraham. From that time onward there are frequent references to their ministry on earth (Gen. 18; 19; 24:7, 40; 28:12; 32:1). They appear to rebuke idolatry (<reflink target="XXX">Judg. 2:1-4</reflink>), to call Gideon (<reflink target="XXX">Judg. 6:11, 12</reflink>), and to consecrate Samson (13:3). In the days of the prophets, from Samuel downward, the angels appear only in their behalf (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 19:5; 2 Kings 6:17; Zech. 1-6; Dan. 4:13, 23; 10:10, 13, 20, 21</reflink>).</description>
    <description>The Incarnation introduces a new era in the ministrations of angels. They come with their Lord to earth to do him service while here. They predict his advent (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 1:20; Luke 1:26-38</reflink>), minister to him after his temptation and agony (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 4:11; Luke 22:43</reflink>), and declare his resurrection and ascension (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 28:2-8; John 20:12, 13; Acts 1:10, 11</reflink>). They are now ministering spirits to the people of God (<reflink target="XXX">Heb. 1:14; Ps. 34:7; 91:11; Matt. 18:10; Acts 5:19; 8:26; 10:3; 12:7; 27:23</reflink>). They rejoice over a penitent sinner (<reflink target="XXX">Luke 15:10</reflink>). They bear the souls of the redeemed to paradise (<reflink target="XXX">Luke 16:22</reflink>); and they will be the ministers of judgement hereafter on the great day (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 13:39, 41, 49; 16:27; 24:31</reflink>). The passages (<reflink target="XXX">Ps. 34:7, Matt. 18:10</reflink>) usually referred to in support of the idea that every individual has a particular guardian angel have no such meaning. They merely indicate that God employs the ministry of angels to deliver his people from affliction and danger, and that the angels do not think it below their dignity to minister even to children and to the least among Christ's disciples.</description>
    <description>The "angel of his presence" (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 63:9. Comp. Ex. 23:20, 21; 32:34; 33:2; Num. 20:16</reflink>) is probably rightly interpreted of the Messiah as the guide of his people. Others have supposed the expression to refer to Gabriel (<reflink target="XXX">Luke 1:19</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Anger">
    <description>the emotion of instant displeasure on account of something evil that presents itself to our view. In itself it is an original susceptibility of our nature, just as love is, and is not necessarily sinful. It may, however, become sinful when causeless, or excessive, or protracted (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 5:22; Eph. 4:26; Col. 3:8</reflink>). As ascribed to God, it merely denotes his displeasure with sin and with sinners (<reflink target="XXX">Ps. 7:11</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Anim">
    <description>fountains, a city in the mountains of Judah (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 15:50</reflink>), now el-Ghuwein, near Eshtemoh, about 10 miles south-west of Hebron.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Animal">
    <description>an organized living creature endowed with sensation. The Levitical law divided animals into clean and unclean, although the distinction seems to have existed before the Flood (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 7:2</reflink>). The clean could be offered in sacrifice and eaten. All animals that had not cloven hoofs and did not chew the cud were unclean. The list of clean and unclean quadrupeds is set forth in the Levitical law (<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 14:3-20; Lev. 11</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Anise">
    <description>This word is found only in Matt. 23:23. It is the plant commonly known by the name of dill, the Peucedanum graveolens of the botanist. This name dill is derived from a Norse word which means to soothe, the plant having the carminative property of allaying pain. The common dill, the Anethum graveolens, is an annual growing wild in the cornfields of Spain and Portugal and the south of Europe generally. There is also a species of dill cultivated in Eastern countries known by the name of shubit. It was this species of garden plant of which the Pharisees were in the habit of paying tithes. The Talmud requires that the seeds, leaves, and stem of dill shall pay tithes. It is an umbelliferous plant, very like the caraway, its leaves, which are aromatic, being used in soups and pickles. The proper anise is the Pimpinella anisum.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Anna">
    <description>grace, an aged widow, the daughter of Phanuel. She was a "prophetess," like Miriam, Deborah, and Huldah (<reflink target="XXX">2 Chr. 34:22</reflink>). After seven years of married life her husband died, and during her long widowhood she daily attended the temple services. When she was eighty-four years old, she entered the temple at the moment when the aged Simeon uttered his memorable words of praise and thanks to God that he had fulfilled his ancient promise in sending his Son into the world (<reflink target="XXX">Luke 2:36, 37</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Annas">
    <description>was high priest A.D. 7-14. In A.D. 25 Caiaphas, who had married the daughter of Annas (<reflink target="XXX">John 18:13</reflink>), was raised to that office, and probably Annas was now made president of the Sanhedrim, or deputy or coadjutor of the high priest, and thus was also called high priest along with Caiaphas (<reflink target="XXX">Luke 3:2</reflink>). By the Mosaic law the high-priesthood was held for life (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 3:10</reflink>); and although Annas had been deposed by the Roman procurator, the Jews may still have regarded him as legally the high priest. Our Lord was first brought before Annas, and after a brief questioning of him (<reflink target="XXX">John 18:19-23</reflink>) was sent to Caiaphas, when some members of the Sanhedrim had met, and the first trial of Jesus took place (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 26:57-68</reflink>). This examination of our Lord before Annas is recorded only by John. Annas was president of the Sanhedrim before which Peter and John were brought (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 4:6</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Anoint">
    <description>The practice of anointing with perfumed oil was common among the Hebrews. (1.) The act of anointing was significant of consecration to a holy or sacred use; hence the anointing of the high priest (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 29:29; Lev. 4:3</reflink>) and of the sacred vessels (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 30:26</reflink>). The high priest and the king are thus called "the anointed" (<reflink target="XXX">Lev. 4:3, 5, 16; 6:20; Ps. 132:10</reflink>). Anointing a king was equivalent to crowning him (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 16:13; 2 Sam. 2:4, etc.</reflink>). Prophets were also anointed (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 19:16; 1 Chr. 16:22; Ps. 105:15</reflink>). The expression, "anoint the shield" (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 21:5</reflink>), refers to the custom of rubbing oil on the leather of the shield so as to make it supple and fit for use in war.</description>
    <description>(2.) Anointing was also an act of hospitality (<reflink target="XXX">Luke 7:38, 46</reflink>). It was the custom of the Jews in like manner to anoint themselves with oil, as a means of refreshing or invigorating their bodies (<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 28:40; Ruth 3:3; 2 Sam. 14:2; Ps. 104:15, etc.</reflink>). This custom is continued among the Arabians to the present day.</description>
    <description>(3.) Oil was used also for medicinal purposes. It was applied to the sick, and also to wounds (<reflink target="XXX">Ps. 109:18; Isa. 1:6; Mark 6:13; James 5:14</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(4.) The bodies of the dead were sometimes anointed (<reflink target="XXX">Mark 14:8; Luke 23:56</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(5.) The promised Deliverer is twice called the "Anointed" or Messiah (<reflink target="XXX">Ps. 2:2; Dan. 9:25, 26</reflink>), because he was anointed with the Holy Ghost (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 61:1</reflink>), figuratively styled the "oil of gladness" (<reflink target="XXX">Ps. 45:7; Heb. 1:9</reflink>). Jesus of Nazareth is this anointed One (<reflink target="XXX">John 1:41; Acts 9:22; 17:2, 3; 18:5, 28</reflink>), the Messiah of the Old Testament.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Ant">
    <description>(Heb. nemalah, from a word meaning to creep, cut off, destroy), referred to in Prov. 6:6; 30:25, as distinguished for its prudent habits. Many ants in Palestine feed on animal substances, but others draw their nourishment partly or exclusively from vegetables. To the latter class belongs the ant to which Solomon refers. This ant gathers the seeds in the season of ripening, and stores them for future use; a habit that has been observed in ants in Texas, India, and Italy.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Antichrist">
    <description>against Christ, or an opposition Christ, a rival Christ. The word is used only by the apostle John. Referring to false teachers, he says (<reflink target="XXX">1 John 2:18, 22; 4:3; 2 John 1:7</reflink>), "Even now are there many antichrists."</description>
    <description>(1.) This name has been applied to the "little horn" of the "king of fierce countenance" (<reflink target="XXX">Dan. 7:24, 25; 8:23-25</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(2.) It has been applied also to the "false Christs" spoken of by our Lord (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 24:5, 23, 24</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(3.) To the "man of sin" described by Paul (<reflink target="XXX">2 Thess. 2:3, 4, 8-10</reflink>).</description>

  </item>
  <item id="Antioch">
    <description>(1.) In Syria, on the river Orontes, about 16 miles from the Mediterranean, and some 300 miles north of Jerusalem. It was the metropolis of Syria, and afterwards became the capital of the Roman province in Asia. It ranked third, after Rome and Alexandria, in point of importance, of the cities of the Roman empire. It was called the "first city of the East." Christianity was early introduced into it (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 11:19, 21, 24</reflink>), and the name "Christian" was first applied here to its professors (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 11:26</reflink>). It is intimately connected with the early history of the gospel (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 6:5; 11:19, 27, 28, 30; 12:25; 15:22-35; Gal. 2:11, 12</reflink>). It was the great central point whence missionaries to the Gentiles were sent forth. It was the birth-place of the famous Christian father Chrysostom, who died A.D. 407. It bears the modern name of Antakia, and is now a miserable, decaying Turkish town. Like Philippi, it was raised to the rank of a Roman colony. Such colonies were ruled by "praetors" (R.V. marg., Acts 16:20, 21).</description>
    <description>(2.) In the extreme north of Pisidia; was visited by Paul and Barnabas on the first missionary journey (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 13:14</reflink>). Here they found a synagogue and many proselytes. They met with great success in preaching the gospel, but the Jews stirred up a violent opposition against them, and they were obliged to leave the place. On his return, Paul again visited Antioch for the purpose of confirming the disciples (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 14:21</reflink>). It has been identified with the modern Yalobatch, lying to the east of Ephesus.</description>

  <item id="Antiochus">
    <description>the name of several Syrian kings from B.C. 280 to B.C. 65. The most notable of these were, (1.) Antiochus the Great, who ascended the throne B.C. 223. He is regarded as the "king of the north" referred to in Dan. 11:13-19. He was succeeded (B.C. 187) by his son, Seleucus Philopater, spoken of by Daniel (11:20) as "a raiser of taxes", in the Revised Version, "one that shall cause an exactor to pass through the glory of the kingdom."</description>
    <description>(2.) Antiochus IV., surnamed "Epiphanes" i.e., the Illustrious, succeeded his brother Seleucus (B.C. 175). His career and character are prophetically described by Daniel (11:21-32). He was a "vile person." In a spirit of revenge he organized an expedition against Jerusalem, which he destroyed, putting vast multitudes of its inhabitants to death in the most cruel manner. From this time the Jews began the great war of independence under their heroic Maccabean leaders with marked success, defeating the armies of Antiochus that were sent against them. Enraged at this, Antiochus marched against them in person, threatening utterly to exterminate the nation; but on the way he was suddenly arrested by the hand of death (B.C. 164).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Antipas">
    <description>(1.) Herod Antipas, a son of Herod the Great by his Samaritan wife Malthace. He was tetrarch of Galilee and Peraea during the whole period of our Lord's life on earth (<reflink target="XXX">Luke 23:7</reflink>). He was a frivolous and vain prince, and was chargeable with many infamous crimes (<reflink target="XXX">Mark 8:15; Luke 3:19; 13:31, 32</reflink>). He beheaded John the Baptist (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 14:1-12</reflink>) at the instigation of Herodias, the wife of his half-brother Herod-Philip, whom he had married. Pilate sent Christ to him when he was at Jerusalem at the Passover (<reflink target="XXX">Luke 23:7</reflink>). He asked some idle questions of him, and after causing him to be mocked, sent him back again to Pilate. The wife of Chuza, his house-steward, was one of our Lord's disciples (<reflink target="XXX">Luke 8:3</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(2.) A "faithful martyr" (<reflink target="XXX">Rev. 2:13</reflink>), of whom nothing more is certainly known.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Antipatris">
    <description>a city built by Herod the Great, and called by this name in honour of his father, Antipater. It lay between Caesarea and Lydda, two miles inland, on the great Roman road from Caesarea to Jerusalem. To this place Paul was brought by night (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 23:31</reflink>) on his way to Caesarea, from which it was distant 28 miles. It is identified with the modern, Ras-el-Ain, where rise the springs of Aujeh, the largest springs in Palestine.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Antonia">
    <description>a fortress in Jerusalem, at the north-west corner of the temple area. It is called "the castle" (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 21:34, 37</reflink>). From the stairs of this castle Paul delivered his famous speech to the multitude in the area below (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 22:1-21</reflink>). It was originally a place in which were kept the vestments of the high priest. Herod fortified it, and called it Antonia in honour of his friend Mark Antony. It was of great size, and commanded the temple. It was built on a plateau of rock, separated on the north from the hill Bezetha by a ditch about 30 feet deep and 165 feet wide.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Antothite">
    <description>an inhabitant of Anathoth, found only in 1 Chr. 11:28; 12:3. In 2 Sam. 23:27 it is Anethothite; in 1 Chr. 27:12, Anetothite. (R.V., "Anathothite.")</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Anvil">
    <description>the rendering of the Hebrew word , "beaten," found only in Isa. 41:7.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Ape">
    <description>an animal of the monkey tribe (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 10:22; 2 Chr. 9:21</reflink>). It was brought from India by the fleets of Solomon and Hiram, and was called by the Hebrews _koph_, and by the Greeks _kepos_, both words being just the Indian Tamil name of the monkey, kapi, i.e., swift, nimble, active. No species of ape has ever been found in Palestine or the adjacent regions.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Apelles">
    <description>a Christian at Rome whom Paul salutes (<reflink target="XXX">Rom. 16:10</reflink>), and styles "approved in Christ."</description>

  <item id="Apharsachites">
    <description>a company of the colonists whom the Assyrian king planted in Samaria (<reflink target="XXX">Ezra 5:6; 6:6</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Apharsites">
    <description>another of the tribes removed to Samaria (<reflink target="XXX">Ezra 4:9</reflink>), or perhaps the same as the preceding.</description>

  <item id="Aphik">
    <description>(<reflink target="XXX">Judg. 1:31</reflink>); Aphek (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 13:4; 19:30</reflink>), stronghold. (1.) A city of the tribe of Asher. It was the scene of the licentious worship of the Syrian Aphrodite. The ruins of the temple, "magnificent ruins" in a "spot of strange wildness and beauty", are still seen at Afka, on the north-west slopes of Lebanon, near the source of the river Adonis (now Nahr Ibrahim), 12 miles east of Gebal.</description>
    <description>(2.) A city of the tribe of Issachar, near to Jezreel (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 4:1; 29:1; comp. 28:4</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(3.) A town on the road from Damascus to Palestine, in the level plain east of Jordan, near which Benhadad was defeated by the Israelites (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 20:26, 30; 2 Kings 13:17</reflink>). It has been identified with the modern Fik, 6 miles east of the Sea of Galilee, opposite Tiberias.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Apocalypse">
    <description>the Greek name of the Book of Revelation (q.v.).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Apocrypha">
    <description>hidden, spurious, the name given to certain ancient books which found a place in the LXX. and Latin Vulgate versions of the Old Testament, and were appended to all the great translations made from them in the sixteenth century, but which have no claim to be regarded as in any sense parts of the inspired Word.</description>
    <description>(1.) They are not once quoted by the New Testament writers, who frequently quote from the LXX. Our Lord and his apostles confirmed by their authority the ordinary Jewish canon, which was the same in all respects as we now have it.</description>
    <description>(2.) These books were written not in Hebrew but in Greek, and during the "period of silence," from the time of Malachi, after which oracles and direct revelations from God ceased till the Christian era.</description>
    <description>(3.) The contents of the books themselves show that they were no part of Scripture. The Old Testament Apocrypha consists of fourteen books, the chief of which are the Books of the Maccabees (q.v.), the Books of Esdras, the Book of Wisdom, the Book of Baruch, the Book of Esther, Ecclesiasticus, Tobit, Judith, etc.</description>
    <description>The New Testament Apocrypha consists of a very extensive literature, which bears distinct evidences of its non-apostolic origin, and is utterly unworthy of regard.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Apollonia">
    <description>a city of Macedonia between Amphipolis and Thessalonica, from which it was distant about 36 miles. Paul and Silas passed through it on their way to Thessalonica (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 17:1</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Apollos">
    <description>a Jew "born at Alexandria," a man well versed in the Scriptures and eloquent (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 18:24; R.V., "learned"</reflink>). He came to Ephesus (about A.D. 49), where he spake "boldly" in the synagogue (18:26), although he did not know as yet that Jesus of Nazareth was the Messiah. Aquila and Priscilla instructed him more perfectly in "the way of God", i.e., in the knowledge of Christ. He then proceeded to Corinth, where he met Paul (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 18:27; 19:1</reflink>). He was there very useful in watering the good seed Paul had sown (<reflink target="XXX">1 Cor. 1:12</reflink>), and in gaining many to Christ. His disciples were much attached to him (<reflink target="XXX">1 Cor. 3:4-7, 22</reflink>). He was with Paul at Ephesus when he wrote the First Epistle to the Corinthians; and Paul makes kindly reference to him in his letter to Titus (3:13). Some have supposed, although without sufficient ground, that he was the author of the Epistle to the Hebrews.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Apollyon">
    <description>destroyer, the name given to the king of the hosts represented by the locusts (<reflink target="XXX">Rev. 9:11</reflink>). It is the Greek translation of the Hebrew Abaddon (q.v.).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Apostle">
    <description>a person sent by another; a messenger; envoy. This word is once used as a descriptive designation of Jesus Christ, the Sent of the Father (<reflink target="XXX">Heb. 3:1; John 20:21</reflink>). It is, however, generally used as designating the body of disciples to whom he intrusted the organization of his church and the dissemination of his gospel, "the twelve," as they are called (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 10:1-5; Mark 3:14; 6:7; Luke 6:13; 9:1</reflink>). We have four lists of the apostles, one by each of the synoptic evangelists (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 10:2-4; Mark 3:16; Luke 6:14</reflink>), and one in the Acts (1:13). No two of these lists, however, perfectly coincide.</description>
    <description>Our Lord gave them the "keys of the kingdom," and by the gift of his Spirit fitted them to be the founders and governors of his church (<reflink target="XXX">John 14:16, 17, 26; 15:26, 27; 16:7-15</reflink>). To them, as representing his church, he gave the commission to "preach the gospel to every creature" (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 28:18-20</reflink>). After his ascension he communicated to them, according to his promise, supernatural gifts to qualify them for the discharge of their duties (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 2:4; 1 Cor. 2:16; 2:7, 10, 13; 2 Cor. 5:20; 1 Cor. 11:2</reflink>). Judas Iscariot, one of "the twelve," fell by transgression, and Matthias was substituted in his place (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 1:21</reflink>). Saul of Tarsus was afterwards added to their number (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 9:3-20; 20:4; 26:15-18; 1 Tim. 1:12; 2:7; 2 Tim. 1:11</reflink>).</description>
    <description>Luke has given some account of Peter, John, and the two Jameses (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 12:2, 17; 15:13; 21:18</reflink>), but beyond this we know nothing from authentic history of the rest of the original twelve. After the martyrdom of James the Greater (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 12:2</reflink>), James the Less usually resided at Jerusalem, while Paul, "the apostle of the uncircumcision," usually travelled as a missionary among the Gentiles (<reflink target="XXX">Gal. 2:8</reflink>). It was characteristic of the apostles and necessary (1) that they should have seen the Lord, and been able to testify of him and of his resurrection from personal knowledge (<reflink target="XXX">John 15:27; Acts 1:21, 22; 1 Cor. 9:1; Acts 22:14, 15</reflink>). (2.) They must have been immediately called to that office by Christ (<reflink target="XXX">Luke 6:13; Gal. 1:1</reflink>). (3.) It was essential that they should be infallibly inspired, and thus secured against all error and mistake in their public teaching, whether by word or by writing (<reflink target="XXX">John 14:26; 16:13; 1 Thess. 2:13</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(4.) Another qualification was the power of working miracles (<reflink target="XXX">Mark 16:20; Acts 2:43; 1 Cor. 12:8-11</reflink>). The apostles therefore could have had no successors. They are the only authoritative teachers of the Christian doctrines. The office of an apostle ceased with its first holders.</description>
    <description>In 2 Cor. 8:23 and Phil. 2:25 the word "messenger" is the rendering of the same Greek word, elsewhere rendered "apostle."</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Apothecary">
    <description>rendered in the margin and the Revised Version "perfumer," in Ex. 30:25; 37:29; Eccl. 10:1. The holy oils and ointments were prepared by priests properly qualified for this office. The feminine plural form of the Hebrew word is rendered "confectionaries" in 1 Sam. 8:13.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Apparel">
    <description>In Old Testament times the distinction between male and female attire was not very marked. The statute forbidding men to wear female apparel (<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 22:5</reflink>) referred especially to ornaments and head-dresses. Both men and women wore (1) an under garment or tunic, which was bound by a girdle. One who had only this tunic on was spoken of as "naked" (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 19:24; Job 24:10; Isa. 20:2</reflink>). Those in high stations sometimes wore two tunics, the outer being called the "upper garment" (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 15:27; 18:4; 24:5; Job 1:20</reflink>). (2.) They wore in common an over-garment ("mantle," Isa. 3:22; 1 Kings 19:13; 2 Kings 2:13), a loose and flowing robe. The folds of this upper garment could be formed into a lap (<reflink target="XXX">Ruth 3:15; Ps. 79:12; Prov. 17:23; Luke 6:38</reflink>). Generals of armies usually wore scarlet robes (<reflink target="XXX">Judg. 8:26; Nah. 2:3</reflink>). A form of conspicuous raiment is mentioned in Luke 20:46; comp. Matt. 23:5.</description>
    <description>Priests alone wore trousers. Both men and women wore turbans. Kings and nobles usually had a store of costly garments for festive occasions (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 3:22; Zech. 3:4</reflink>) and for presents (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 45:22; Esther 4:4; 6:8, 11; 1 Sam. 18:4; 2 Kings 5:5; 10:22</reflink>). Prophets and ascetics wore coarse garments (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 20:2; Zech. 13:4; Matt. 3:4</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Appeal">
    <description>a reference of any case from an inferior to a superior court. Moses established in the wilderness a series of judicatories such that appeals could be made from a lower to a higher (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 18:13-26.</reflink>)</description>
    <description>Under the Roman law the most remarkable case of appeal is that of Paul from the tribunal of Festus at Caesarea to that of the emperor at Rome (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 25:11, 12, 21, 25</reflink>). Paul availed himself of the privilege of a Roman citizen in this matter.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Apphia">
    <description>increasing, a female Christian at Colosse (<reflink target="XXX">Philemon 1:2</reflink>), supposed by some to have been the wife of Philemon.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Appii Forum">
    <description>i.e., "the market of Appius" (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 28:15, R.V.</reflink>), a town on the road, the "Appian Way," from Rome to Brundusium. It was 43 miles from Rome. Here Paul was met by some Roman Christians on his way to the capital. It was natural that they should halt here and wait for him, because from this place there were two ways by which travellers might journey to Rome.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Apple">
    <description>(Heb. tappuah, meaning "fragrance"). Probably the apricot or quince is intended by the word, as Palestine was too hot for the growth of apples proper. It is enumerated among the most valuable trees of Palestine (<reflink target="XXX">Joel 1:12</reflink>), and frequently referred to in Canticles, and noted for its beauty (2:3, 5; 8:5). There is nothing to show that it was the "tree of the knowledge of good and evil." Dr. Tristram has suggested that the apricot has better claims than any other fruit-tree to be the apple of Scripture. It grows to a height of 30 feet, has a roundish mass of glossy leaves, and bears an orange coloured fruit that gives out a delicious perfume. The "apple of the eye" is the Heb. _ishon_, meaning manikin, i.e., the pupil of the eye (<reflink target="XXX">Prov. 7:2</reflink>). (Comp. the promise, Zech. 2:8; the prayer, Ps. 17:8; and its fulfilment, Deut. 32:10.)</description>
    <description>The so-called "apple of Sodom" some have supposed to be the Solanum sanctum (Heb. hedek), rendered "brier" (q.v.) in Micah 7:4, a thorny plant bearing fruit like the potato-apple. This shrub abounds in the Jordan valley. (<see target="x-self">See ENGEDI.</see>)</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Apron">
    <description>found in the Authorized Version in Gen. 3:7, of the bands of fig-leaves made by our first parents. In Acts 19:12, it denotes the belt or half-girdle worn by artisans and servants round the waist for the purpose of preserving the clothing from injury. In marg. of Authorized Version, Ruth 3:15, correctly rendered instead of "vail." (R.V., "mantle.")</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Aquila">
    <description>eagle, a native of Pontus, by occupation a tent-maker, whom Paul met on his first visit to Corinth (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 18:2</reflink>). Along with his wife Priscilla he had fled from Rome in consequence of a decree (A.D. 50) by Claudius commanding all Jews to leave the city. Paul sojourned with him at Corinth, and they wrought together at their common trade, making Cilician hair-cloth for tents. On Paul's departure from Corinth after eighteen months, Aquila and his wife accompanied him to Ephesus, where they remained, while he proceeded to Syria (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 18:18, 26</reflink>). When they became Christians we are not informed, but in Ephesus they were (<reflink target="XXX">1 Cor. 16:19</reflink>) Paul's "helpers in Christ Jesus." We find them afterwards at Rome (<reflink target="XXX">Rom. 16:3</reflink>), interesting themselves still in the cause of Christ. They are referred to some years after this as being at Ephesus (<reflink target="XXX">2 Tim. 4:19</reflink>). This is the last notice we have of them.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Arab">
    <description>ambush, a city in the mountains of Judah (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 15:52</reflink>), now Er-Rabiyeh.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Arabah">
    <description>plain, in the Revised Version of 2 Kings 14:25; Josh. 3:16; 8:14; 2 Sam. 2:29; 4:7 (in all these passages the A.V. has "plain"); Amos 6:14 (A.V. "wilderness"). This word is found in the Authorized Version only in Josh. 18:18. It denotes the hollow depression through which the Jordan flows from the Lake of Galilee to the Dead Sea. It is now called by the Arabs el-Ghor. But the Ghor is sometimes spoken of as extending 10 miles south of the Dead Sea, and thence to the Gulf of Akabah on the Red Sea is called the Wady el-Arabah.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Arabia">
    <description>arid, an extensive region in the south-west of Asia. It is bounded on the west by the Isthmus of Suez and the Red Sea, on the south by the Indian Ocean, and on the east by the Persian Gulf and the Euphrates. It extends far into the north in barren deserts, meeting those of Syria and Mesopotamia. It is one of the few countries of the world from which the original inhabitants have never been expelled.</description>
    <description>It was anciently divided into three parts:, (1.) Arabia Felix (Happy Arabia), so called from its fertility. It embraced a large portion of the country now known by the name of Arabia. The Arabs call it Yemen. It lies between the Red Sea and the Persian Gulf. (2.) Arabia Deserta, the el-Badieh or "Great Wilderness" of the Arabs. From this name is derived that which is usually given to the nomadic tribes which wander over this region, the "Bedaween," or, more generally, "Bedouin," (3.) Arabia Petraea, i.e., the Rocky Arabia, so called from its rocky mountains and stony plains. It comprehended all the north-west portion of the country, and is much better known to travellers than any other portion. This country is, however, divided by modern geographers into (1) Arabia Proper, or the Arabian Peninsula; (2) Northern Arabia, or the Arabian Desert; and (3) Western Arabia, which includes the peninsula of Sinai and the Desert of Petra, originally inhabited by the Horites (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 14:6, etc.</reflink>), but in later times by the descendants of Esau, and known as the Land of Edom or Idumea, also as the Desert of Seir or Mount Seir.</description>
    <description>The whole land appears (Gen. 10) to have been inhabited by a variety of tribes of different lineage, Ishmaelites, Arabians, Idumeans, Horites, and Edomites; but at length becoming amalgamated, they came to be known by the general designation of Arabs. The modern nation of Arabs is predominantly Ishmaelite. Their language is the most developed and the richest of all the Semitic languages, and is of great value to the student of Hebrew.</description>
    <description>The Israelites wandered for forty years in Arabia. In the days of Solomon, and subsequently, commercial intercourse was to a considerable extent kept up with this country (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 10:15; 2 Chr. 9:14; 17:11</reflink>). Arabians were present in Jerusalem at Pentecost (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 2:11</reflink>). Paul retired for a season into Arabia after his conversion (<reflink target="XXX">Gal. 1:17</reflink>). This country is frequently referred to by the prophets (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 21:11; 42:11; Jer. 25:24, etc.</reflink>)</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Arad">
    <description>(1.) Now Tell Arad, a Canaanite city, about 20 miles south of Hebron. The king of Arad "fought against Israel and took of them prisoners" when they were retreating from the confines of Edom (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 21:1; 33:40; Judg. 1:16</reflink>). It was finally subdued by Joshua (12:14).</description>
    <description>(2.) One of the sons of Beriah (<reflink target="XXX">1 Chr. 8:15</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Aram">
    <description>the son of Shem (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 10:22</reflink>); according to Gen. 22:21, a grandson of Nahor. In Matt. 1:3, 4, and Luke 3:33, this word is the Greek form of Ram, the father of Amminadab (<reflink target="XXX">1 Chr. 2:10</reflink>).</description>
    <description>The word means high, or highlands, and as the name of a country denotes that elevated region extending from the northeast of Palestine to the Euphrates. It corresponded generally with the Syria and Mesopotamia of the Greeks and Romans. In Gen. 25:20; 31:20, 24; Deut. 26:5, the word "Syrian" is properly "Aramean" (R.V., marg.). Damascus became at length the capital of the several smaller kingdoms comprehended under the designation "Aram" or "Syria."</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Aram-naharaim">
    <description>Aram of the two rivers, is Mesopotamia (<reflink target="XXX">as it is rendered in Gen. 24:10</reflink>), the country enclosed between the Tigris on the east and the Euphrates on the west (Ps. 60, title); called also the "field of Aram" (<reflink target="XXX">Hos. 12:12, R.V.</reflink>) i.e., the open country of Aram; in the Authorized Version, "country of Syria." Padan-aram (q.v.) was a portion of this country.</description>

    <description>wild goat, a descendant of Seir the Horite (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 36:28</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Ararat">
    <description>sacred land or high land, the name of a country on one of the mountains of which the ark rested after the Flood subsided (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 8:4</reflink>). The "mountains" mentioned were probably the Kurdish range of South Armenia. In 2 Kings 19:37, Isa. 37:38, the word is rendered "Armenia" in the Authorized Version, but in the Revised Version, "Land of Ararat." In Jer. 51:27, the name denotes the central or southern portion of Armenia. It is, however, generally applied to a high and almost inaccessible mountain which rises majestically from the plain of the Araxes. It has two conical peaks, about 7 miles apart, the one 14,300 feet and the other 10,300 feet above the level of the plain. Three thousand feet of the summit of the higher of these peaks is covered with perpetual snow. It is called Kuh-i-nuh, i.e., "Noah's mountain", by the Persians. This part of Armenia was inhabited by a people who spoke a language unlike any other now known, though it may have been related to the modern Georgian. About B.C. 900 they borrowed the cuneiform characters of Nineveh, and from this time we have inscriptions of a line of kings who at times contended with Assyria. At the close of the seventh century B.C. the kingdom of Ararat came to an end, and the country was occupied by a people who are ancestors of the Armenians of the present day.</description>

  <item id="Araunah">
    <description>agile; also called Ornan 1 Chr. 21:15, a Jebusite who dwelt in Jerusalem before it was taken by the Israelites. The destroying angel, sent to punish David for his vanity in taking a census of the people, was stayed in his work of destruction near a threshing-floor belonging to Araunah which was situated on Mount Moriah. Araunah offered it to David as a free gift, together with the oxen and the threshing instruments; but the king insisted on purchasing it at its full price (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 24:24; 1 Chr. 21:24, 25</reflink>), for, according to the law of sacrifices, he could not offer to God what cost him nothing. On the same place Solomon afterwards erected the temple (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 24:16; 2 Chr. 3:1</reflink>). (<see target="x-self">See ALTAR.</see>)</description>

  <item id="Arch">
    <description>an architectural term found only in Ezek. 40:16, 21, 22, 26, 29. There is no absolute proof that the Israelites employed arches in their buildings. The arch was employed in the building of the pyramids of Egypt. The oldest existing arch is at Thebes, and bears the date B.C. 1350. There are also still found the remains of an arch, known as Robinson's Arch, of the bridge connecting Zion and Moriah. (<see target="x-self">See TYROPOEON VALLEY.</see>)</description>

    <description>ruler of the people, son of Herod the Great, by Malthace, a Samaritan woman. He was educated along with his brother Antipas at Rome. He inherited from his father a third part of his kingdom viz., Idumea, Judea, and Samaria, and hence is called "king" (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 2:22</reflink>). It was for fear of him that Joseph and Mary turned aside on their way back from Egypt. Till a few days before his death Herod had named Antipas as his successor, but in his last moments he named Archelaus.</description>

  <item id="Archer">
    <description>a shooter with the bow (<reflink target="XXX">1 Chr. 10:3</reflink>). This art was of high antiquity (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 21:20; 27:3</reflink>). Saul was wounded by the Philistine archers (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 31:3</reflink>). The phrase "breaking the bow" (<reflink target="XXX">Hos. 1:5; Jer. 49:35</reflink>) is equivalent to taking away one's power, while "strengthening the bow" is a symbol of its increase (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 49:24</reflink>). The Persian archers were famous among the ancients (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 13:18; Jer. 49:35; 50:9, 14, 29, 42.</reflink>) (<see target="x-self">See BOW</see>).</description>

    <description>bear-keeper, the name given by the ancients to the brightest star in the constellation Bootes. In the Authorized Version (<reflink target="XXX">Job 9:9; 38:32</reflink>) it is the rendering of the Hebrew word _'ash_, which probably designates the constellation the Great Bear. This word ('ash) is supposed to be derived from an Arabic word meaning night-watcher, because the Great Bear always revolves about the pole, and to our nothern hemisphere never sets.</description>

This led to a war between Aretas and Herod Antipas. Herod's army was wholly destroyed (A.D. 36). Aretas, taking advantage of the complications of the times on account of the death of the Emperor Tiberius (A.D. 37), took possession of Damascus (<reflink target="XXX">2 Cor. 11:32; comp.

  <item id="Argob">
    <description>stony heap, an "island," as it has been called, of rock about 30 miles by 20, rising 20 or 30 feet above the table-land of Bashan; a region of crags and chasms wild and rugged in the extreme. On this "island" stood sixty walled cities, ruled over by Og. It is called Trachonitis ("the rugged region") in the New Testament (<reflink target="XXX">Luke 3:1</reflink>). These cities were conquered by the Israelites (<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 3:4; 1 Kings 4:13</reflink>). It is now called the Lejah. Here "sixty walled cities are still traceable in a space of 308 square miles. The architecture is ponderous and massive. Solid walls 4 feet thick, and stones on one another without cement; the roofs enormous slabs of basaltic rock, like iron; the doors and gates are of stone 18 inches thick, secured by ponderous bars. The land bears still the appearance of having been called the 'land of giants' under the giant Og." "I have more than once entered a deserted city in the evening, taken possession of a comfortable house, and spent the night in peace. Many of the houses in the ancient cities of Bashan are perfect, as if only finished yesterday. The walls are sound, the roofs unbroken, and even the window-shutters in their places. These ancient cities of Bashan probably contain the very oldest specimens of domestic architecture in the world" (Porter's Giant Cities). (<see target="x-self">See BASHAN.</see>)</description>

    <description>Noah's ark, a building of gopher-wood, and covered with pitch, 300 cubits long, 50 cubits broad, and 30 cubits high (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 6:14-16</reflink>); an oblong floating house of three stories, with a door in the side and a window in the roof. It was 100 years in building (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 5:32; 7:6</reflink>). It was intended to preserve certain persons and animals from the deluge which God was about to bring over the earth. It contained eight persons (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 7:13; 2 Pet. 2:5</reflink>), and of all "clean" animals seven pairs, and of "unclean" one pair, and of birds seven pairs of each sort (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 7:2, 3</reflink>). It was in the form of an oblong square, with flat bottom and sloping roof. Traditions of the Deluge, by which the race of man was swept from the earth, and of the ark of Noah have been found existing among all nations.</description>
    <description>The ark of bulrushes in which the infant Moses was laid (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 2:3</reflink>) is called in the Hebrew _teebah_, a word derived from the Egyptian _teb_, meaning "a chest." It was daubed with slime and with pitch. The bulrushes of which it was made were the papyrus reed.</description>
    <description>The sacred ark is designated by a different Hebrew word, _'aron'_, which is the common name for a chest or coffer used for any purpose (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 50:26; 2 Kings 12:9, 10</reflink>). It is distinguished from all others by such titles as the "ark of God" (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 3:3</reflink>), "ark of the covenant" (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 3:6; Heb. 9:4</reflink>), "ark of the testimony" (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 25:22</reflink>). It was made of acacia or shittim wood, a cubit and a half broad and high and two cubits long, and covered all over with the purest gold. Its upper surface or lid, the mercy-seat, was surrounded with a rim of gold; and on each of the two sides were two gold rings, in which were placed two gold-covered poles by which the ark could be carried (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 7:9; 10:21; 4:5,19, 20; 1 Kings 8:3, 6</reflink>). Over the ark, at the two extremities, were two cherubim, with their faces turned toward each other (<reflink target="XXX">Lev. 16:2; Num. 7:89</reflink>). Their outspread wings over the top of the ark formed the throne of God, while the ark itself was his footstool (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 25:10-22; 37:1-9</reflink>). The ark was deposited in the "holy of holies," and was so placed that one end of the poles by which it was carried touched the veil which separated the two apartments of the tabernacle (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 8:8</reflink>). The two tables of stone which constituted the "testimony" or evidence of God's covenant with the people (<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 31:26</reflink>), the "pot of manna" (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 16:33</reflink>), and "Aaron's rod that budded" (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 17:10</reflink>), were laid up in the ark (<reflink target="XXX">Heb. 9:4</reflink>). (<see target="x-self">See TABERNACLE</see>) The ark and the sanctuary were "the beauty of Israel" (<reflink target="XXX">Lam. 2:1</reflink>). During the journeys of the Israelites the ark was carried by the priests in advance of the host (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 4:5, 6; 10:33-36; Ps. 68:1; 132:8</reflink>). It was borne by the priests into the bed of the Jordan, which separated, opening a pathway for the whole of the host to pass over (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 3:15, 16; 4:7, 10, 11, 17, 18</reflink>). It was borne in the procession round Jericho (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 6:4, 6, 8, 11, 12</reflink>). When carried it was always wrapped in the veil, the badgers' skins, and blue cloth, and carefully concealed even from the eyes of the Levites who carried it. After the settlement of Israel in Palestine the ark remained in the tabernacle at Gilgal for a season, and was then removed to Shiloh till the time of Eli, between 300 and 400 years (<reflink target="XXX">Jer. 7:12</reflink>), when it was carried into the field of battle so as to secure, as they supposed, victory to the Hebrews, and was taken by the Philistines (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 4:3-11</reflink>), who sent it back after retaining it seven months (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 5:7, 8</reflink>). It remained then at Kirjath-jearim (7:1,2) till the time of David (twenty years), who wished to remove it to Jerusalem; but the proper mode of removing it having been neglected, Uzzah was smitten with death for putting "forth his hand to the ark of God," and in consequence of this it was left in the house of Obed-edom in Gath-rimmon for three months (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 6:1-11</reflink>), at the end of which time David removed it in a grand procession to Jerusalem, where it was kept till a place was prepared for it (12-19). It was afterwards deposited by Solomon in the temple (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 8:6-9</reflink>). When the Babylonians destroyed Jerusalem and plundered the temple, the ark was probably taken away by Nebuchadnezzar and destroyed, as no trace of it is afterwards to be found. The absence of the ark from the second temple was one of the points in which it was inferior to the first temple.</description>

    <description>occurs only in Rev. 16:16 (R.V., "Har-Magedon"), as symbolically designating the place where the "battle of that great day of God Almighty" (ver. 14) shall be fought. The word properly means the "mount of Megiddo." It is the scene of the final conflict between Christ and Antichrist. The idea of such a scene was suggested by the Old Testament great battle-field, the plain of Esdraelon (q.v.).</description>

  <item id="Armenia">
    <description>high land, occurs only in Authorized Version, 2 Kings 19:37; in Revised Version, "Ararat," which is the Hebrew word. A country in western Asia lying between the Caspian and the Black Sea. Here the ark of Noah rested after the Deluge (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 8:4</reflink>). It is for the most part high table-land, and is watered by the Aras, the Kur, the Euphrates, and the Tigris. Ararat was properly the name of a part of ancient Armenia. Three provinces of Armenia are mentioned in Jer. 51:27, Ararat, Minni, and Ashchenaz. Some, however, think Minni a contraction for Armenia. (See ARARAT</description>

  </item>
  <item id="Armour">
    <description>is employed in the English Bible to denote military equipment, both offensive and defensive.</description>
    <description>(1.) The offensive weapons were different at different periods of history. The "rod of iron" (<reflink target="XXX">Ps. 2:9</reflink>) is supposed to mean a mace or crowbar, an instrument of great power when used by a strong arm. The "maul" (<reflink target="XXX">Prov. 25:18; cognate Hebrew word rendered "battle-axe" in Jer. 51:20, and "slaughter weapon" in Ezek. 9:2</reflink>) was a war-hammer or martel. The "sword" is the usual translation of _hereb_, which properly means "poniard." The real sword, as well as the dirk-sword (which was always double-edged), was also used (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 17:39; 2 Sam. 20:8; 1 Kings 20:11</reflink>). The spear was another offensive weapon (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 8:18; 1 Sam. 17:7</reflink>). The javelin was used by light troops (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 25:7, 8; 1 Sam. 13:22</reflink>). Saul threw a javelin at David (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 19:9, 10</reflink>), and so virtually absolved him from his allegiance. The bow was, however, the chief weapon of offence. The arrows were carried in a quiver, the bow being always unbent till the moment of action (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 27:3; 48:22; Ps. 18:34</reflink>). The sling was a favourite weapon of the Benjamites (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 17:40; 1 Chr. 12:2. Comp. 1 Sam. 25:29</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(2.) Of the defensive armour a chief place is assigned to the shield or buckler. There were the great shield or target (the _tzinnah_), for the protection of the whole person (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 15:1; Ps. 47:9; 1 Sam. 17:7; Prov. 30:5</reflink>), and the buckler (Heb. _mageen_) or small shield (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 10:17; Ezek. 26:8</reflink>). In Ps. 91:4 "buckler" is properly a roundel appropriated to archers or slingers. The helmet (<reflink target="XXX">Ezek. 27:10; 1 Sam. 17:38</reflink>), a covering for the head; the coat of mail or corselet (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 17:5</reflink>), or habergeon (Neh. 4;16), harness or breat-plate (<reflink target="XXX">Rev. 9:9</reflink>), for the covering of the back and breast and both upper arms (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 59:17; Eph. 6:14</reflink>). The cuirass and corselet, composed of leather or quilted cloth, were also for the covering of the body. Greaves, for the covering of the legs, were worn in the time of David (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 17:6</reflink>). Reference is made by Paul (<reflink target="XXX">Eph. 6:14-17</reflink>) to the panoply of a Roman soldier. The shield here is the thureon, a door-like oblong shield above all, i.e., covering the whole person, not the small round shield. There is no armour for the back, but only for the front.</description>

  <item id="Armour-bearer">
    <description>an officer selected by kings and generals because of his bravery, not only to bear their armour, but also to stand by them in the time of danger. They were the adjutants of our modern armies (<reflink target="XXX">Judg. 9:54; 1 Sam. 14:7; 16:21; 31:6</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Armoury">
    <description>the place in which armour was deposited when not used (<reflink target="XXX">Neh. 3:19; Jer. 50:25</reflink>). At first each man of the Hebrews had his own arms, because all went to war. There were no arsenals or magazines for arms till the time of David, who had a large collection of arms, which he consecrated to the Lord in his tabernacle (1 Sa,. 21:9; 2 Sam. 8:7-12; 1 Chr. 26:26, 27).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Army">
    <description>The Israelites marched out of Egypt in military order (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 13:18, "harnessed;" marg., "five in a rank"</reflink>). Each tribe formed a battalion, with its own banner and leader (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 2:2; 10:14</reflink>). In war the army was divided into thousands and hundreds under their several captains (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 31:14</reflink>), and also into families (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 2:34; 2 Chr. 25:5; 26:12</reflink>). From the time of their entering the land of Canaan to the time of the kings, the Israelites made little progress in military affairs, although often engaged in warfare. The kings introduced the custom of maintaining a bodyguard (the Gibborim; i.e., "heroes"), and thus the nucleus of a standing army was formed. Saul had an army of 3,000 select warriors (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 13:2; 14:52; 24:2</reflink>). David also had a band of soldiers around him (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 23:13; 25:13</reflink>). To this band he afterwards added the Cherethites and the Pelethites (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 15:18; 20:7</reflink>). At first the army consisted only of infantry (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 4:10; 15:4</reflink>), as the use of horses was prohibited (<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 17:16</reflink>); but chariots and horses were afterwards added (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 8:4; 1 Kings 10:26, 28, 29; 1 Kings 9:19</reflink>). In 1 Kings 9:22 there is given a list of the various gradations of rank held by those who composed the army. The equipment and maintenance of the army were at the public expense (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 17:28, 29; 1 Kings 4:27; 10:16, 17; Judg. 20:10</reflink>). At the Exodus the number of males above twenty years capable of bearing arms was 600,000 (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 12:37</reflink>). In David's time it mounted to the number of 1,300,000 (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 24:9</reflink>).</description>

  <item id="Arnon">
    <description>swift, the southern boundary of the territory of Israel beyond Jordan, separating it from the land of Moab (<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 3:8, 16</reflink>). This river (referred to twenty-four times in the Bible) rises in the mountains of Gilead, and after a circuitous course of about 80 miles through a deep ravine it falls into the Dead Sea nearly opposite Engedi. The stream is almost dry in summer. It is now called el-Mujeb. The territory of the Amorites extended from the Arnon to the Jabbok.</description>

  <item id="Arphaxad">
    <description>son of Shem, born the year after the Deluge. He died at the age of 438 years (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 11:10-13; 1 Chr. 1:17, 18; Luke 3:36</reflink>). He dwelt in Mesopotamia, and became, according to the Jewish historian Josephus, the progenitor of the Chaldeans. The tendency is to recognize in the word the name of the country nearest the ancient domain of the Chaldeans. Some regard the word as an Egypticized form of the territorial name of Ur Kasdim, or Ur of the Chaldees.</description>

    <description>(2.) The king mentioned in Ezra 7:1, in the seventh year (B.C. 458) of whose reign Ezra led a second colony of Jews back to Jerusalem, was probably Longimanus, who reigned for forty years (B.C. 464-425); the grandson of Darius, who, fourteen years later, permitted Nehemiah to return and rebuild Jerusalem.</description>

    <description>physician, son of Abijah and grandson of Rehoboam, was the third king of Judah. He was zealous in maintaining the true worship of God, and in rooting all idolatry, with its accompanying immoralities, out of the land (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 15:8-14</reflink>). The Lord gave him and his land rest and prosperity. It is recorded of him, however, that in his old age, when afflicted, he "sought not to the Lord, but to the physicians" (<reflink target="XXX">comp. Jer. 17:5</reflink>). He died in the forty-first year of his reign, greatly honoured by his people (<reflink target="XXX">2 Chr. 16:1-13</reflink>), and was succeeded by his son Jehoshaphat.</description>

  <item id="Ashdod">
    <description>stronghold, a Philistine city (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 15:47</reflink>), about midway between Gaza and Joppa, and 3 miles from the Mediterranean. It was one of the chief seats of the worship of Dagon (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 5:5</reflink>). It belonged to the tribe of Judah (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 15:47</reflink>), but it never came into their actual possession. It was an important city, as it stood on the highroad from Egypt to Palestine, and hence was strongly fortified (<reflink target="XXX">2 Chr. 26:6; Isa. 20:1</reflink>). Uzziah took it, but fifty years after his death it was taken by the Assyrians (B.C. 758). According to Sargon's record, it was captured by him in B.C. 711. The only reference to it in the New Testament, where it is called Azotus, is in the account of Philip's return from Gaza (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 8:40</reflink>). It is now called Eshdud.</description>

Of the tribe founded by him nothing is recorded beyond its holding a place in the list of the tribes (35:26; 46:17; Ex. 1:4, etc.) It increased in numbers twenty-nine percent, during the thirty-eight years' wanderings. The place of this tribe during the march through the desert was between Dan and Naphtali (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 2:27</reflink>). The boundaries of the inheritance given to it, which contained some of the richest soil in Palestine, and the names of its towns, are recorded in Josh. 19:24-31; Judg. 1:31, 32. Asher and Simeon were the only tribes west of the Jordan which furnished no hero or judge for the nation.

This was the name of a sensual Canaanitish goddess Astarte, the feminine of the Assyrian Ishtar. Its symbol was the stem of a tree deprived of its boughs, and rudely shaped into an image, and planted in the ground. Such religious symbols ("groves") are frequently alluded to in Scripture (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 34:13; Judg. 6:25; 2 Kings 23:6; 1 Kings 16:33, etc.</reflink>).

  <item id="Ashkelon">
    <description>=Askelon=Ascalon, was one of the five cities of the Philistines (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 13:3; 1 Sam. 6:17</reflink>). It stood on the shore of the Mediterranean, 12 miles north of Gaza. It is mentioned on an inscription at Karnak in Egypt as having been taken by king Rameses II., the oppressor of the Hebrews. In the time of the judges (<reflink target="XXX">Judg. 1:18</reflink>) it fell into the possession of the tribe of Judah; but it was soon after retaken by the Philistines (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 1:20</reflink>), who were not finally dispossessed till the time of Alexander the Great. Samson went down to this place from Timnath, and slew thirty men and took their spoil. The prophets foretold its destruction (<reflink target="XXX">Jer. 25:20; 47:5, 7</reflink>). It became a noted place in the Middle Ages, having been the scene of many a bloody battle between the Saracens and the Crusaders. It was beseiged and taken by Richard the Lion-hearted, and "within its walls and towers now standing he held his court." Among the Tell Amarna tablets (<see target="x-self">see EGYPT</see>) are found letters or official despatches from Yadaya, "captain of horse and dust of the king's feet," to the "great king" of Egypt, dated from Ascalon. It is now called 'Askalan.</description>

    <description>a city of Bashan, in the kingdom of Og (<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 1:4; Josh. 12:4; 13:12; 9:10</reflink>). It was in the half-tribe of Manasseh (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 13:12</reflink>), and as a Levitical city was given to the Gershonites (<reflink target="XXX">1 Chr. 6:71</reflink>). Uzzia, one of David's valiant men (<reflink target="XXX">1 Chr. 11:44</reflink>), is named as of this city. It is identified with Tell Ashterah, in the Hauran, and is noticed on monuments B.C. 1700-1500. The name Beesh-terah (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 21:27</reflink>) is a contraction for Beth-eshterah, i.e., "the house of Ashtaroth."</description>

  <item id="Ashteroth Karnaim">
    <description>Ashteroth of the two horns, the abode of the Rephaim (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 14:5</reflink>). It may be identified with Ashtaroth preceding; called "Karnaim", i.e., the "two-horned" (the crescent moon). The Samaritan version renders the word by "Sunamein," the present es-Sunamein, 28 miles south of Damascus.</description>

  <item id="Ashtoreth">
    <description>the moon goddess of the Phoenicians, representing the passive principle in nature, their principal female deity; frequently associated with the name of Baal, the sun-god, their chief male deity (<reflink target="XXX">Judg. 10:6; 1 Sam. 7:4; 12:10</reflink>). These names often occur in the plural (Ashtaroth, Baalim), probably as indicating either different statues or different modifications of the deities. This deity is spoken of as Ashtoreth of the Zidonians. She was the Ishtar of the Accadians and the Astarte of the Greeks (<reflink target="XXX">Jer. 44:17; 1 Kings 11:5, 33; 2 Kings 23:13</reflink>). There was a temple of this goddess among the Philistines in the time of Saul (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 31:10</reflink>). Under the name of Ishtar, she was one of the great deities of the Assyrians. The Phoenicians called her Astarte. Solomon introduced the worship of this idol (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 11:33</reflink>). Jezebel's 400 priests were probably employed in its service (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 18:19</reflink>).

Proconsular Asia contained the seven churches of the Apocalypse (<reflink target="XXX">Rev. 1:11</reflink>). The "chiefs of Asia" (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 19:31</reflink>) were certain wealthy citizens who were annually elected to preside over the games and religious festivals of the several cities to which they belonged. Some of these "Asiarchs" were Paul's friends.</description>

  <item id="Asnapper">
    <description>probably the same as Assur-bani-pal (Sardanapalos of the Greeks), styled the "great and noble" (<reflink target="XXX">Ezra 4:10</reflink>), was the son and successor (B.C. 668) of Esar-haddon (q.v.). He was "luxurious, ambitious, and cruel, but a magnificent patron of literature." He formed at Nineveh a library of clay tablets, numbering about 10,000. These are now mostly in the British Museum. They throw much light on the history and antiquities of Assyria.</description>
    <description>Assur-bani-pal was a munificent patron of literature, and the conqueror of Elam. Towards the middle of his reign his empire was shaken by a great rebellion headed by his brother in Babylon. The rebellion was finally put down, but Egypt was lost, and the military power of Assyria was so exhausted that it could with difficulty resist the hordes of Kimmerians who poured over Western Asia.

  <item id="Asp">
    <description>(Heb. pethen), Deut. 32:33; Job 20:14, 16; Isa. 11:8. It was probably the Egyptian cobra (Naja haje), which was very poisonous (<reflink target="XXX">Rom. 3:13; Gr. aspis</reflink>). The Egyptians worshipped it as the _uraeus_, and it was found in the desert and in the fields. The peace and security of Messiah's reign is represented by the figure of a child playing on the hole of the asp. (See ADDER</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Ass">
    <description>frequently mentioned throughout Scripture. Of the domesticated species we read of, (1.) The she ass (Heb. 'athon), so named from its slowness (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 12:16; 45:23; Num. 22:23; 1 Sam. 9:3</reflink>). (2.) The male ass (Heb. hamor), the common working ass of Western Asia, so called from its red colour. Issachar is compared to a strong ass (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 49:14</reflink>). It was forbidden to yoke together an ass and an ox in the plough (<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 22:10</reflink>). (3.) The ass's colt (Heb. 'air), mentioned Judg. 10:4; 12:14. It is rendered "foal" in Gen. 32:15; 49:11. (<reflink target="XXX">Comp. Job 11:12; Isa. 30:6.</reflink>) The ass is an unclean animal, because it does not chew the cud (<reflink target="XXX">Lev. 11:26. Comp. 2 Kings 6:25</reflink>). Asses constituted a considerable portion of wealth in ancient times (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 12:16; 30:43; 1 Chr. 27:30; Job 1:3; 42:12</reflink>). They were noted for their spirit and their attachment to their master (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 1:3</reflink>). They are frequently spoken of as having been ridden upon, as by Abraham (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 22:3</reflink>), Balaam (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 22:21</reflink>), the disobedient prophet (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 13:23</reflink>), the family of Abdon the judge, seventy in number (<reflink target="XXX">Judg. 12:14</reflink>), Zipporah (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 4:20</reflink>), the Shunammite (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 25:30</reflink>), etc. Zechariah (9:9) predicted our Lord's triumphal entrance into Jerusalem, "riding upon an ass, and upon a colt," etc. (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 21:5, R.V.</reflink>).</description>
    <description>Of wild asses two species are noticed, (1) that called in Hebrew _'arod_, mentioned Job 39:5 and Dan. 5:21, noted for its swiftness; and (2) that called _pe're_, the wild ass of Asia (<reflink target="XXX">Job 39:6-8; 6:5; 11:12; Isa. 32:14; Jer. 2:24; 14:6, etc.</reflink>). The wild ass was distinguished for its fleetness and its extreme shyness. In allusion to his mode of life, Ishmael is likened to a wild ass (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 16:12. Here the word is simply rendered "wild" in the Authorized Version, but in the Revised Version, "wild-ass among men"</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Asshur">
    <description>second son of Shem (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 10:22; 1 Chr. 1:17</reflink>). He went from the land of Shinar and built Nineveh, etc. (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 10:11,12</reflink>). He probably gave his name to Assyria, which is the usual translation of the word, although the form Asshur is sometimes retained (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 24:22, 24; Ezek. 27:23, etc.</reflink>). In Gen. 2:14 "Assyria" ought to be "Asshur," which was the original capital of Assyria, a city represented by the mounds of Kalah Sherghat, on the west bank of the Tigris. This city was founded by Bel-kap-kapu about B.C. 1700. At a later date the capital was shifted to Ninua, or Nineveh, now Koyunjik, on the eastern bank of the river.

  <item id="Assos">
    <description>a sea-port town of Proconsular Asia, in the district of Mysia, on the north shore of the Gulf of Adramyttium. Paul came hither on foot along the Roman road from Troas (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 20:13, 14</reflink>), a distance of 20 miles. It was about 30 miles distant from Troas by sea. The island of Lesbos lay opposite it, about 7 miles distant.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Assurance">
    <description>The resurrection of Jesus (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 17:31</reflink>) is the "assurance" (Gr. pistis, generally rendered "faith") or pledge God has given that his revelation is true and worthy of acceptance. The "full assurance [Gr. plerophoria, 'full bearing'] of faith" (<reflink target="XXX">Heb. 10:22</reflink>) is a fulness of faith in God which leaves no room for doubt. The "full assurance of understanding" (<reflink target="XXX">Col. 2:2</reflink>) is an entire unwavering conviction of the truth of the declarations of Scripture, a joyful steadfastness on the part of any one of conviction that he has grasped the very truth. The "full assurance of hope" (<reflink target="XXX">Heb. 6:11</reflink>) is a sure and well-grounded expectation of eternal glory (<reflink target="XXX">2 Tim. 4:7, 8</reflink>). This assurance of hope is the assurance of a man's own particular salvation.</description>
    <description>This infallible assurance, which believers may attain unto as to their own personal salvation, is founded on the truth of the promises (<reflink target="XXX">Heb. 6:18</reflink>), on the inward evidence of Christian graces, and on the testimony of the Spirit of adoption (<reflink target="XXX">Rom. 8:16</reflink>). That such a certainty may be attained appears from the testimony of Scripture (<reflink target="XXX">Rom. 8:16; 1 John 2:3; 3:14</reflink>), from the command to seek after it (<reflink target="XXX">Heb. 6:11; 2 Pet. 1:10</reflink>), and from the fact that it has been attained (<reflink target="XXX">2 Tim. 1:12; 4:7, 8; 1 John 2:3; 4:16</reflink>).</description>
    <description>This full assurance is not of the essence of saving faith. It is the result of faith, and posterior to it in the order of nature, and so frequently also in the order of time. True believers may be destitute of it. Trust itself is something different from the evidence that we do trust. Believers, moreover, are exhorted to go on to something beyond what they at present have when they are exhorted to seek the grace of full assurance (<reflink target="XXX">Heb. 10:22; 2 Pet. 1:5-10</reflink>). The attainment of this grace is a duty, and is to be diligently sought.</description>
    <description>"Genuine assurance naturally leads to a legitimate and abiding peace and joy, and to love and thankfulness to God; and these from the very laws of our being to greater buoyancy, strength, and cheerfulness in the practice of obedience in every department of duty."</description>
    <description>This assurance may in various ways be shaken, diminished, and intermitted, but the principle out of which it springs can never be lost. (<see target="x-self">See FAITH.</see>)</description>

  <item id="Assyria">
    <description>the name derived from the city Asshur on the Tigris, the original capital of the country, was originally a colony from Babylonia, and was ruled by viceroys from that kingdom. It was a mountainous region lying to the north of Babylonia, extending along the Tigris as far as to the high mountain range of Armenia, the Gordiaean or Carduchian mountains. It was founded in B.C. 1700 under Bel-kap-kapu, and became an independent and a conquering power, and shook off the yoke of its Babylonian masters. It subdued the whole of Northern Asia. The Assyrians were Semites (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 10:22</reflink>), but in process of time non-Semite tribes mingled with the inhabitants. They were a military people, the "Romans of the East."</description>
    <description>Of the early history of the kingdom of Assyria little is positively known. In B.C. 1120 Tiglath-pileser I., the greatest of the Assyrian kings, "crossed the Euphrates, defeated the kings of the Hittites, captured the city of Carchemish, and advanced as far as the shores of the Mediterranean." He may be regarded as the founder of the first Assyrian empire. After this the Assyrians gradually extended their power, subjugating the states of Northern Syria. In the reign of Ahab, king of Israel, Shalmaneser II. marched an army against the Syrian states, whose allied army he encountered and vanquished at Karkar. This led to Ahab's casting off the yoke of Damascus and allying himself with Judah. Some years after this the Assyrian king marched an army against Hazael, king of Damascus. He besieged and took that city. He also brought under tribute Jehu, and the cities of Tyre and Sidon.</description>
    <description>About a hundred years after this (B.C. 745) the crown was seized by a military adventurer called Pul, who assumed the name of Tiglath-pileser III. He directed his armies into Syria, which had by this time regained its independence, and took (B.C. 740) Arpad, near Aleppo, after a siege of three years, and reduced Hamath. Azariah (Uzziah) was an ally of the king of Hamath, and thus was compelled by Tiglath-pileser to do him homage and pay a yearly tribute.</description>
    <description>In B.C. 738, in the reign of Menahem, king of Israel, Pul invaded Israel, and imposed on it a heavy tribute (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 15:19</reflink>). Ahaz, the king of Judah, when engaged in a war against Israel and Syria, appealed for help to this Assyrian king by means of a present of gold and silver (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 16:8</reflink>); who accordingly "marched against Damascus, defeated and put Rezin to death, and besieged the city itself." Leaving a portion of his army to continue the siege, "he advanced through the province east of Jordan, spreading fire and sword," and became master of Philistia, and took Samaria and Damascus. He died B.C. 727, and was succeeded by Shalmanezer IV., who ruled till B.C. 722. He also invaded Syria (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 17:5</reflink>), but was deposed in favour of Sargon (q.v.) the Tartan, or commander-in-chief of the army, who took Samaria (q.v.) after a siege of three years, and so put an end to the kingdom of Israel, carrying the people away into captivity, B.C. 722 (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 17:1-6, 24; 18:7, 9</reflink>). He also overran the land of Judah, and took the city of Jerusalem (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 10:6, 12, 22, 24, 34</reflink>). Mention is next made of Sennacherib (B.C. 705), the son and successor of Sargon (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 18:13; 19:37; Isa. 7:17, 18</reflink>); and then of Esar-haddon, his son and successor, who took Manasseh, king of Judah, captive, and kept him for some time a prisoner at Babylon, which he alone of all the Assyrian kings made the seat of his government (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 19:37; Isa. 37:38</reflink>).</description>
    <description>Assur-bani-pal, the son of Esarhaddon, became king, and in Ezra 4:10 is referred to as Asnapper. From an early period Assyria had entered on a conquering career, and having absorbed Babylon, the kingdoms of Hamath, Damascus, and Samaria, it conquered Phoenicia, and made Judea feudatory, and subjected Philistia and Idumea. At length, however, its power declined. In B.C. 727 the Babylonians threw off the rule of the Assyrians, under the leadership of the powerful Chaldean prince Merodach-baladan (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 20:12</reflink>), who, after twelve years, was subdued by Sargon, who now reunited the kingdom, and ruled over a vast empire. But on his death the smouldering flames of rebellion again burst forth, and the Babylonians and Medes successfully asserted their independence (B.C. 625), and Assyria fell according to the prophecies of Isaiah (10:5-19), Nahum (3:19), and Zephaniah (3:13), and the many separate kingdoms of which it was composed ceased to recognize the "great king" (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 18:19; Isa. 36:4</reflink>). Ezekiel (31) attests (about B.C. 586) how completely Assyria was overthrown. It ceases to be a nation. (<see target="x-self">See NINEVEH; BABYLON.</see>)</description>

    <description>The Hebrews were devout students of the wonders of the starry firmanent (<reflink target="XXX">Amos 5:8; Ps. 19</reflink>). In the Book of Job, which is the oldest book of the Bible in all probability, the constellations are distinguished and named. Mention is made of the "morning star" (<reflink target="XXX">Rev. 2:28; comp. Isa. 14:12</reflink>), the "seven stars" and "Pleiades," "Orion," "Arcturus," the "Great Bear" (<reflink target="XXX">Amos 5:8; Job 9:9; 38:31</reflink>), "the crooked serpent," Draco (<reflink target="XXX">Job 26:13</reflink>), the Dioscuri, or Gemini, "Castor and Pollux" (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 28:11</reflink>). The stars were called "the host of heaven" (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 40:26; Jer. 33:22</reflink>).</description>
    <description>The oldest divisions of time were mainly based on the observation of the movements of the heavenly bodies, the "ordinances of heaven" (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 1:14-18; Job 38:33; Jer. 31:35; 33:25</reflink>). Such observations led to the division of the year into months and the mapping out of the appearances of the stars into twelve portions, which received from the Greeks the name of the "zodiac." The word "Mazzaroth" (<reflink target="XXX">Job 38:32</reflink>) means, as the margin notes, "the twelve signs" of the zodiac. Astronomical observations were also necessary among the Jews in order to the fixing of the proper time for sacred ceremonies, the "new moons," the "passover," etc. Many allusions are found to the display of God's wisdom and power as seen in the starry heavens (Ps. 8; 19:1-6; Isa. 51:6, etc.)</description>

  <item id="Athens">
    <description>the capital of Attica, the most celebrated city of the ancient world, the seat of Greek literature and art during the golden period of Grecian history. Its inhabitants were fond of novelty (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 17:21</reflink>), and were remarkable for their zeal in the worship of the gods. It was a sarcastic saying of the Roman satirist that it was "easier to find a god at Athens than a man."</description>
    <description>On his second missionary journey Paul visited this city (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 17:15; comp. 1 Thess. 3:1</reflink>), and delivered in the Areopagus his famous speech (17:22-31). The altar of which Paul there speaks as dedicated "to the [properly "an"] unknown God" (23) was probably one of several which bore the same inscription. It is supposed that they originated in the practice of letting loose a flock of sheep and goats in the streets of Athens on the occasion of a plague, and of offering them up in sacrifice, at the spot where they lay down, "to the god concerned."</description>

  <item id="Atonement">
    <description>This word does not occur in the Authorized Version of the New Testament except in Rom. 5:11, where in the Revised Version the word "reconciliation" is used. In the Old Testament it is of frequent occurrence.</description>
    <description>The meaning of the word is simply at-one-ment, i.e., the state of being at one or being reconciled, so that atonement is reconciliation. Thus it is used to denote the effect which flows from the death of Christ.</description>
    <description>But the word is also used to denote that by which this reconciliation is brought about, viz., the death of Christ itself; and when so used it means satisfaction, and in this sense to make an atonement for one is to make satisfaction for his offences (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 32:30; Lev. 4:26; 5:16; Num. 6:11</reflink>), and, as regards the person, to reconcile, to propitiate God in his behalf.</description>
    <description>By the atonement of Christ we generally mean his work by which he expiated our sins. But in Scripture usage the word denotes the reconciliation itself, and not the means by which it is effected. When speaking of Christ's saving work, the word "satisfaction," the word used by the theologians of the Reformation, is to be preferred to the word "atonement." Christ's satisfaction is all he did in the room and in behalf of sinners to satisfy the demands of the law and justice of God. Christ's work consisted of suffering and obedience, and these were vicarious, i.e., were not merely for our benefit, but were in our stead, as the suffering and obedience of our vicar, or substitute. Our guilt is expiated by the punishment which our vicar bore, and thus God is rendered propitious, i.e., it is now consistent with his justice to manifest his love to transgressors. Expiation has been made for sin, i.e., it is covered. The means by which it is covered is vicarious satisfaction, and the result of its being covered is atonement or reconciliation. To make atonement is to do that by virtue of which alienation ceases and reconciliation is brought about. Christ's mediatorial work and sufferings are the ground or efficient cause of reconciliation with God. They rectify the disturbed relations between God and man, taking away the obstacles interposed by sin to their fellowship and concord. The reconciliation is mutual, i.e., it is not only that of sinners toward God, but also and pre-eminently that of God toward sinners, effected by the sin-offering he himself provided, so that consistently with the other attributes of his character his love might flow forth in all its fulness of blessing to men. The primary idea presented to us in different forms throughout the Scripture is that the death of Christ is a satisfaction of infinite worth rendered to the law and justice of God (q.v.), and accepted by him in room of the very penalty man had incurred. It must also be constantly kept in mind that the atonement is not the cause but the consequence of God's love to guilty men (<reflink target="XXX">John 3:16; Rom. 3:24, 25; Eph. 1:7; 1 John 1:9; 4:9</reflink>). The atonement may also be regarded as necessary, not in an absolute but in a relative sense, i.e., if man is to be saved, there is no other way than this which God has devised and carried out (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 34:7; Josh. 24:19; Ps. 5:4; 7:11; Nahum 1:2, 6; Rom. 3:5</reflink>). This is God's plan, clearly revealed; and that is enough for us to know.</description>

  <item id="Avenger of blood">
    <description>(Heb. goel, from verb gaal, "to be near of kin," "to redeem"), the nearest relative of a murdered person. It was his right and duty to slay the murderer (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 14:7, 11</reflink>) if he found him outside of a city of refuge. In order that this law might be guarded against abuse, Moses appointed six cities of refuge (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 21:13; Num. 35:13; Deut. 19:1,9</reflink>). These were in different parts of the country, and every facility was afforded the manslayer that he might flee to the city that lay nearest him for safety. Into the city of refuge the avenger durst not follow him. This arrangement applied only to cases where the death was not premeditated. The case had to be investigated by the authorities of the city, and the wilful murderer was on no account to be spared. He was regarded as an impure and polluted person, and was delivered up to the _goel_ (<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 19:11-13</reflink>). If the offence was merely manslaughter, then the fugitive must remain within the city till the death of the high priest (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 35:25</reflink>).</description>

  <item id="Axe">

It was used for felling trees (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 10:34</reflink>) and hewing timber for building. It is the rendering of a different word in Judg. 9:48, 1 Sam. 13:20, 21, Ps. 74:5, which refers to its sharpness. In 2 Kings 6:5 it is the translation of a word used with reference to its being made of iron. In Isa. 44:12 the Revised Version renders by "axe" the Hebrew _maatsad_, which means a "hewing" instrument. In the Authorized Version it is rendered "tongs." It is also used in Jer. 10:3, and rendered "axe." The "battle-axe" (army of Medes and Persians) mentioned in Jer. 51:20 was probably, as noted in the margin of the Revised Version, a "maul" or heavy mace. In Ps. 74:6 the word so rendered means "feller." (<reflink target="XXX">See the figurative expression in Matt. 3:10; Luke 3:9.</reflink>)</description>

  <item id="Azazel">
    <description>(<reflink target="XXX">Lev. 16:8, 10, 26, Revised Version only here; rendered "scape-goat" in the Authorized Version</reflink>). This word has given rise to many different views. Some Jewish interpreters regard it as the name of a place some 12 miles east of Jerusalem, in the wilderness. Others take it to be the name of an evil spirit, or even of Satan. But when we remember that the two goats together form a type of Christ, on whom the Lord "laid the iniquity of us all," and examine into the root meaning of this word (viz., "separation"), the interpretation of those who regard the one goat as representing the atonement made, and the other, that "for Azazel," as representing the effect of the great work of atonement (viz., the complete removal of sin), is certainly to be preferred. The one goat which was "for Jehovah" was offered as a sin-offering, by which atonement was made. But the sins must also be visibly banished, and therefore they were symbolically laid by confession on the other goat, which was then "sent away for Azazel" into the wilderness. The form of this word indicates intensity, and therefore signifies the total separation of sin: it was wholly carried away. It was important that the result of the sacrifices offered by the high priest alone in the sanctuary should be embodied in a visible transaction, and hence the dismissal of the "scape-goat." It was of no consequence what became of it, as the whole import of the transaction lay in its being sent into the wilderness bearing away sin. As the goat "for Jehovah" was to witness to the demerit of sin and the need of the blood of atonement, so the goat "for Azazel" was to witness to the efficacy of the sacrifice and the result of the shedding of blood in the taking away of sin.</description>

The priests of Baal were in great numbers (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 18:19</reflink>), and of various classes (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 10:19</reflink>). Their mode of offering sacrifices is described in 1 Kings 18:25-29. The sun-god, under the general title of Baal, or "lord," was the chief object of worship of the Canaanites. Each locality had its special Baal, and the various local Baals were summed up under the name of Baalim, or "lords." Each Baal had a wife, who was a colourless reflection of himself.</description>

  <item id="Babel, tower of">
    <description>the name given to the tower which the primitive fathers of our race built in the land of Shinar after the Deluge (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 11:1-9</reflink>). Their object in building this tower was probably that it might be seen as a rallying-point in the extensive plain of Shinar, to which they had emigrated from the uplands of Armenia, and so prevent their being scattered abroad. But God interposed and defeated their design by condounding their language, and hence the name Babel, meaning "confusion." In the Babylonian tablets there is an account of this event, and also of the creation and the deluge. (<see target="x-self">See CHALDEA.</see>)</description>
    <description>The Temple of Belus, which is supposed to occupy its site, is described by the Greek historian Herodotus as a temple of great extent and magnificence, erected by the Babylonians for their god Belus. The treasures Nebuchadnezzar brought from Jerusalem were laid up in this temple (<reflink target="XXX">2 Chr. 36:7</reflink>).</description>
    <description>The Birs Nimrud, at ancient Borsippa, about 7 miles south-west of Hillah, the modern town which occupies a part of the site of ancient Babylon, and 6 miles from the Euphrates, is an immense mass of broken and fire-blasted fragments, of about 2,300 feet in circumference, rising suddenly to the height of 235 feet above the desert-plain, and is with probability regarded as the ruins of the tower of Babel. This is "one of the most imposing ruins in the country." Others think it to be the ruins of the Temple of Belus.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Babylon">
    <description>the Greek form of BABEL; Semitic form Babilu, meaning "The Gate of God." In the Assyrian tablets it means "The city of the dispersion of the tribes." The monumental list of its kings reaches back to B.C. 2300, and includes Khammurabi, or Amraphel (q.v.), the contemporary of Abraham. It stood on the Euphrates, about 200 miles above its junction with the Tigris, which flowed through its midst and divided it into two almost equal parts. The Elamites invaded Chaldea (i.e., Lower Mesopotamia, or Shinar, and Upper Mesopotamia, or Accad, now combined into one) and held it in subjection. At length Khammu-rabi delivered it from the foreign yoke, and founded the new empire of Chaldea (q.v.), making Babylon the capital of the united kingdom. This city gradually grew in extent and grandeur, but in process of time it became subject to Assyria. On the fall of Nineveh (B.C. 606) it threw off the Assyrian yoke, and became the capital of the growing Babylonian empire. Under Nebuchadnezzar it became one of the most splendid cities of the ancient world.</description>
    <description>After passing through various vicissitudes the city was occupied by Cyrus, "king of Elam," B.C. 538, who issued a decree permitting the Jews to return to their own land (Ezra 1). It then ceased to be the capital of an empire. It was again and again visited by hostile armies, till its inhabitants were all driven from their homes, and the city became a complete desolation, its very site being forgotten from among men.</description>
    <description>On the west bank of the Euphrates, about 50 miles south of Bagdad, there is found a series of artificial mounds of vast extent. These are the ruins of this once famous proud city. These ruins are principally (1) the great mound called Babil by the Arabs. This was probably the noted Temple of Belus, which was a pyramid about 480 feet high. (2) The Kasr (i.e., "the palace"). This was the great palace of Nebuchadnezzar. It is almost a square, each side of which is about 700 feet long. The little town of Hillah, near the site of Babylon, is built almost wholly of bricks taken from this single mound. (3) A lofty mound, on the summit of which stands a modern tomb called Amran ibn-Ali. This is probably the most ancient portion of the remains of the city, and represents the ruins of the famous hanging-gardens, or perhaps of some royal palace. The utter desolation of the city once called "The glory of kingdoms" (<reflink target="XXX">Isa.13:19</reflink>) was foretold by the prophets (<reflink target="XXX">Isa.13:4-22; Jer. 25:12; 50:2, 3; Dan. 2:31-38</reflink>).</description>
    <description>The Babylon mentioned in 1 Pet. 5:13 was not Rome, as some have thought, but the literal city of Babylon, which was inhabited by many Jews at the time Peter wrote.</description>
    <description>In Rev. 14:8; 16:19; 17:5; and 18:2, "Babylon" is supposed to mean Rome, not considered as pagan, but as the prolongation of the ancient power in the papal form. Rome, pagan and papal, is regarded as one power. "The literal Babylon was the beginner and supporter of tyranny and idolatry...This city and its whole empire were taken by the Persians under Cyrus; the Persians were subdued by the Macedonians, and the Macedonians by the Romans; so that Rome succeeded to the power of old Babylon. And it was her method to adopt the worship of the false deities she had conquered; so that by her own act she became the heiress and successor of all the Babylonian idolatry, and of all that was introduced into it by the immediate successors of Babylon, and consequently of all the idolatry of the earth." Rome, or "mystical Babylon," is "that great city which reigneth over the kings of the earth" (17:18).</description>

  <item id="Babylon, kingdom of">
    <description>called "the land of the Chaldeans" (<reflink target="XXX">Jer. 24:5; Ezek, 12:13</reflink>), was an extensive province in Central Asia along the valley of the Tigris from the Persian Gulf northward for some 300 miles. It was famed for its fertility and its riches. Its capital was the city of Babylon, a great commercial centre (<reflink target="XXX">Ezek. 17:4; Isa. 43:14</reflink>). Babylonia was divided into the two districts of Accad in the north, and Summer (probably the Shinar of the Old Testament) in the south. Among its chief cities may be mentioned Ur (now Mugheir or Mugayyar), on the western bank of the Euphrates; Uruk, or Erech (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 10:10</reflink>) (now Warka), between Ur and Babylon; Larsa (now Senkereh), the Ellasar of Gen. 14:1, a little to the east of Erech; Nipur (now Niffer), south-east of Babylon; Sepharvaim (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 17:24</reflink>), "the two Sipparas" (now Abu-Habba), considerably to the north of Babylon; and Eridu, "the good city" (now Abu-Shahrein), which lay originally on the shore of the Persian Gulf, but is now, owing to the silting up of the sand, about 100 miles distant from it. Another city was Kulunu, or Calneh (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 10:10</reflink>).</description>
    <description>The salt-marshes at the mouths of the Euphrates and Tigris were called Marratu, "the bitter" or "salt", the Merathaim of Jer. 50:21. They were the original home of the Kalda, or Chaldeans.</description>
    <description>The most famous of the early kings of Babylonia were Sargon of Accad (B.C.3800) and his son, Naram-Sin, who conquered a large part of Western Asia, establishing their power in Palestine, and even carrying their arms to the Sinaitic peninsula. A great Babylonian library was founded in the reign of Sargon. Babylonia was subsequently again broken up into more than one state, and at one time fell under the domination of Elam. This was put an end to by Khammu-rabi (Amraphel), who drove the Elamites out of the country, and overcame Arioch, the son of an Elamite prince. From this time forward Babylonia was a united monarchy. About B.C. 1750 it was conquered by the Kassi, or Kosseans, from the mountains of Elam, and a Kassite dynasty ruled over it for 576 years and 9 months.</description>
    <description>In the time of Khammu-rabi, Syria and Palestine were subject to Babylonia and its Elamite suzerain; and after the overthrow of the Elamite supremacy, the Babylonian kings continued to exercise their influence and power in what was called "the land of the Amorites." In the epoch of the Kassite dynasty, however, Canaan passed into the hands of Egypt.</description>
    <description>In B.C. 729, Babylonia was conquered by the Assyrian king Tiglath-pileser III.; but on the death of Shalmaneser IV. it was seized by the Kalda or "Chaldean" prince Merodach-baladan (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 20:12-19</reflink>), who held it till B.C. 709, when he was driven out by Sargon.</description>
    <description>Under Sennacherib, Babylonia revolted from Assyria several times, with the help of the Elamites, and after one of these revolts Babylon was destroyed by Sennacherib, B.C. 689. It was rebuilt by Esarhaddon, who made it his residence during part of the year, and it was to Babylon that Manasseh was brought a prisoner (<reflink target="XXX">2 Chr. 33:11</reflink>). After the death of Esarhaddon, Saul-sumyukin, the viceroy of Babylonia, revolted against his brother the Assyrian king, and the revolt was suppressed with difficulty.</description>
    <description>When Nineveh was destroyed, B.C. 606, Nabopolassar, the viceroy of Babylonia, who seems to have been of Chaldean descent, made himself independent. His son Nebuchadrezzar (Nabu-kudur-uzur), after defeating the Egyptians at Carchemish, succeeded him as king, B.C. 604, and founded the Babylonian empire. He strongly fortified Babylon, and adorned it with palaces and other buildings. His son, Evil-merodach, who succeeded him in B.C. 561, was murdered after a reign of two years. The last monarch of the Babylonian empire was Nabonidus (Nabu-nahid), B.C. 555-538, whose eldest son, Belshazzar (Bilu-sar-uzur), is mentioned in several inscriptions. Babylon was captured by Cyrus, B.C. 538, and though it revolted more than once in later years, it never succeeded in maintaining its independence.</description>

    <description>this word is found in Ex. 25:5; 26:14; 35:7, 23; 36:19; 39:34; Num. 4:6, etc. The tabernacle was covered with badgers' skins; the shoes of women were also made of them (<reflink target="XXX">Ezek. 16:10</reflink>). Our translators seem to have been misled by the similarity in sound of the Hebrew _tachash_ and the Latin _taxus_, "a badger." The revisers have correctly substituted "seal skins." The Arabs of the Sinaitic peninsula apply the name _tucash_ to the seals and dugongs which are common in the Red Sea, and the skins of which are largely used as leather and for sandals. Though the badger is common in Palestine, and might occur in the wilderness, its small hide would have been useless as a tent covering. The dugong, very plentiful in the shallow waters on the shores of the Red Sea, is a marine animal from 12 to 30 feet long, something between a whale and a seal, never leaving the water, but very easily caught. It grazes on seaweed, and is known by naturalists as Halicore tabernaculi.</description>

    <description>(2.) Another word (kees) so rendered means a bag for carrying weights (<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 25:13; Prov. 16:11; Micah 6:11</reflink>). It also denotes a purse (<reflink target="XXX">Prov. 1:14</reflink>) and a cup (23:31).</description>
    <description>(3.) Another word rendered "bag" in 1 Sam. 17:40 is rendered "sack" in Gen. 42:25; and in 1 Sam. 9:7; 21:5 "vessel," or wallet for carrying food.</description>
    <description>(4.) The word rendered in the Authorized Version "bags," in which the priests bound up the money contributed for the restoration of the temple (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 12:10</reflink>), is also rendered "bundle" (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 42:35; 1 Sam. 25:29</reflink>).

  <item id="Bake">
    <description>The duty of preparing bread was usually, in ancient times, committed to the females or the slaves of the family (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 18:6; Lev. 26:26; 1 Sam. 8:13</reflink>); but at a later period we find a class of public bakers mentioned (<reflink target="XXX">Hos. 7:4, 6; Jer. 37:21</reflink>).</description>
    <description>The bread was generally in the form of long or round cakes (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 29:23; 1 Sam. 2:36</reflink>), of a thinness that rendered them easily broken (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 58:7; Matt. 14:19; 26:26; Acts 20:11</reflink>). Common ovens were generally used; at other times a jar was half-filled with hot pebbles, and the dough was spread over them. Hence we read of "cakes baken on the coals" (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 19:6</reflink>), and "baken in the oven" (<reflink target="XXX">Lev. 2:4</reflink>). (See BREAD</description>

  <item id="Balaam">
    <description>lord of the people; foreigner or glutton, as interpreted by others, the son of Beor, was a man of some rank among the Midianites (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 31:8; comp. 16</reflink>). He resided at Pethor (<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 23:4</reflink>), in Mesopotamia (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 23:7</reflink>). It is evident that though dwelling among idolaters he had some knowledge of the true God; and was held in such reputation that it was supposed that he whom he blessed was blessed, and he whom he cursed was cursed. When the Israelites were encamped on the plains of Moab, on the east of Jordan, by Jericho, Balak sent for Balaam "from Aram, out of the mountains of the east," to curse them; but by the remarkable interposition of God he was utterly unable to fulfil Balak's wish, however desirous he was to do so. The apostle Peter refers (<reflink target="XXX">2 Pet. 2:15, 16</reflink>) to this as an historical event. In Micah 6:5 reference also is made to the relations between Balaam and Balak. Though Balaam could not curse Israel, yet he suggested a mode by which the divine displeasure might be caused to descend upon them (Num. 25). In a battle between Israel and the Midianites (q.v.) Balaam was slain while fighting on the side of Balak (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 31:8</reflink>).</description>
    <description>The "doctrine of Balaam" is spoken of in Rev. 2:14, in allusion to the fact that it was through the teaching of Balaam that Balak learned the way by which the Israelites might be led into sin. (<see target="x-self">See NICOLAITANES.</see>) Balaam was constrained to utter prophecies regarding the future of Israel of wonderful magnificence and beauty of expression (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 24:5-9, 17</reflink>).</description>

This same word is translated "measuring reed" in Ezek. 40:3,5; 42:16-18. There is another Hebrew word, _mozena'yim_, i.e., "two poisers", also so rendered (<reflink target="XXX">Dan. 5:27</reflink>). The balances as represented on the most ancient Egyptian monuments resemble those now in use. A "pair of balances" is a symbol of justice and fair dealing (<reflink target="XXX">Job 31:6; Ps. 62:9; Prov. 11:1</reflink>). The expression denotes great want and scarcity in Rev. 6:5.</description>

  <item id="Baldness">
    <description>from natural causes was uncommon (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 2:23; Isa. 3:24</reflink>). It was included apparently under "scab" and "scurf," which disqualified for the priesthood (<reflink target="XXX">Lev. 21:20</reflink>). The Egyptians were rarely subject to it. This probably arose from their custom of constantly shaving the head, only allowing the hair to grow as a sign of mourning. With the Jews artificial baldness was a sign of mourning (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 22:12; Jer. 7:29; 16:6</reflink>); it also marked the conclusion of a Nazarite's vow (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 18:18; 21:24; Num. 6:9</reflink>). It is often alluded to (<reflink target="XXX">Micah 1:16; Amos 8:10; Jer. 47:5</reflink>). The Jews were forbidden to follow the customs of surrounding nations in making themselves bald (<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 14:1</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Balm">
    <description>contracted from Bal'sam, a general name for many oily or resinous substances which flow or trickle from certain trees or plants when an incision is made through the bark.</description>
    <description>(1.) This word occurs in the Authorized Version (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 37:25; 43:11; Jer. 8:22; 46:11; 51:8; Ezek. 27:17</reflink>) as the rendering of the Hebrew word _tsori_ or _tseri_, which denotes the gum of a tree growing in Gilead (q.v.), which is very precious. It was celebrated for its medicinal qualities, and was circulated as an article of merchandise by Arab and Phoenician merchants. The shrub so named was highly valued, and was almost peculiar to Palestine. In the time of Josephus it was cultivated in the neighbourhood of Jericho and the Dead Sea. There is an Arab tradition that the tree yielding this balm was brought by the queen of Sheba as a present to Solomon, and that he planted it in his gardens at Jericho.</description>
    <description>(2.) There is another Hebrew word, _basam_ or _bosem_, from which our word "balsam," as well as the corresponding Greek balsamon, is derived. It is rendered "spice" (<reflink target="XXX">Cant. 5:1, 13; 6:2; margin of Revised Version, "balsam;" Ex. 35:28; 1 Kings 10:10</reflink>), and denotes fragrance in general. _Basam_ also denotes the true balsam-plant, a native of South Arabia (Cant. l.c.).</description>

  <item id="Bamah">
    <description>a height, a name used simply to denote a high place where the Jews worshipped idols (<reflink target="XXX">Ezek. 20:29</reflink>). The plural is translated "high places" in Num. 22:41 and Ezek. 36:2.</description>

A Levite who was prominent in the reforms on the return from Babylon (<reflink target="XXX">Neh. 8:7; 9:4,5</reflink>). His son Rehum took part in rebuilding the wall of Jerusalem (<reflink target="XXX">Neh. 3:17</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Banner">
    <description>(1.) The flag or banner of the larger kind, serving for three tribes marching together. These standards, of which there were four, were worked with embroidery and beautifully ornamented (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 1:52; 2:2, 3, 10, 18, 25; Cant. 2:4; 6:4, 10</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(2.) The flag borne by each separate tribe, of a smaller form. Probably it bore on it the name of the tribe to which it belonged, or some distinguishing device (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 2:2,34</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(3.) A lofty signal-flag, not carried about, but stationary. It was usually erected on a mountain or other lofty place. As soon as it was seen the war-trumpets were blown (<reflink target="XXX">Ps. 60:4; Isa. 5:26; 11:12; 13:2; 18:3; 30:17; Jer. 4:6 21; Ezek. 27:7</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(4.) A "sign of fire" (<reflink target="XXX">Jer. 6:1</reflink>) was sometimes used as a signal.</description>
    <description>The banners and ensigns of the Roman army had idolatrous images upon them, and hence they are called the "abomination of desolation" (q.v.). The principal Roman standard, however, was an eagle. (<reflink target="XXX">See Matt. 24:28; Luke 17:37, where the Jewish nation is compared to a dead body, which the eagles gather together to devour.</reflink>)</description>
    <description>God's setting up or giving a banner (<reflink target="XXX">Ps. 20:5; 60:4; Cant. 2:4</reflink>) imports his presence and protection and aid extended to his people.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Banquet">
    <description>a feast provided for the entertainment of a company of guests (Esther 5; 7; 1 Pet. 4:3); such as was provided for our Lord by his friends in Bethany (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 26:6; Mark 14:3; comp. John 12:2</reflink>). These meals were in the days of Christ usually called "suppers," after the custom of the Romans, and were partaken of toward the close of the day. It was usual to send a second invitation (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 22:3; Luke 14:17</reflink>) to those who had been already invited. When the whole company was assembled, the master of the house shut the door with his own hands (<reflink target="XXX">Luke 13:25; Matt. 25:10</reflink>).</description>
    <description>The guests were first refreshed with water and fragrant oil (<reflink target="XXX">Luke 7:38; Mark 7:4</reflink>). A less frequent custom was that of supplying each guest with a robe to be worn during the feast (<reflink target="XXX">Eccles. 9:8; Rev. 3:4, 5; Matt. 22:11</reflink>). At private banquets the master of the house presided; but on public occasions a "governor of the feast" was chosen (<reflink target="XXX">John 2:8</reflink>). The guests were placed in order according to seniority (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 43:33</reflink>), or according to the rank they held (<reflink target="XXX">Prov. 25:6,7; Matt. 23:6; Luke 14:7</reflink>).</description>
    <description>As spoons and knives and forks are a modern invention, and were altogether unknown in the East, the hands alone were necessarily used, and were dipped in the dish, which was common to two of the guests (<reflink target="XXX">John 13:26</reflink>). In the days of our Lord the guests reclined at table; but the ancient Israelites sat around low tables, cross-legged, like the modern Orientals. Guests were specially honoured when extra portions were set before them (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 43:34</reflink>), and when their cup was filled with wine till it ran over (<reflink target="XXX">Ps. 23:5</reflink>). The hands of the guests were usually cleaned by being rubbed on bread, the crumbs of which fell to the ground, and were the portion for dogs (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 15:27; Luke 16:21</reflink>).</description>
    <description>At the time of the three annual festivals at Jerusalem family banquets were common. To these the "widow, and the fatherless, and the stranger" were welcome (<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 16:11</reflink>). Sacrifices also included a banquet (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 34:15; Judg. 16:23</reflink>). Birthday banquets are mentioned (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 40:20; Matt. 14:6</reflink>). They were sometimes protracted, and attended with revelry and excess (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 21:8; 29:22; 1 Sam. 25:2,36; 2 Sam. 13:23</reflink>). Portions were sometimes sent from the table to poorer friends (<reflink target="XXX">Neh. 8:10; Esther 9:19, 22</reflink>). (<see target="x-self">See MEALS.</see>)</description>

  <item id="Baptism for the dead">
    <description>only mentioned in 1 Cor. 15:29. This expression as used by the apostle may be equivalent to saying, "He who goes through a baptism of blood in order to join a glorified church which has no existence [i.e., if the dead rise not] is a fool." Some also regard the statement here as an allusion to the strange practice which began, it is said, to prevail at Corinth, in which a person was baptized in the stead of others who had died before being baptized, to whom it was hoped some of the benefits of that rite would be extended. This they think may have been one of the erroneous customs which Paul went to Corinth to "set in order."</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Baptism of Christ">
    <description>Christ had to be formally inaugurated into the public discharge of his offices. For this purpose he came to John, who was the representative of the law and the prophets, that by him he might be introduced into his offices, and thus be publicly recognized as the Messiah of whose coming the prophecies and types had for many ages borne witness.</description>
    <description>John refused at first to confer his baptism on Christ, for he understood not what he had to do with the "baptism of repentance." But Christ said, "'Suffer it to be so now,' NOW as suited to my state of humiliation, my state as a substitute in the room of sinners." His reception of baptism was not necessary on his own account. It was a voluntary act, the same as his act of becoming incarnate. Yet if the work he had engaged to accomplish was to be completed, then it became him to take on him the likeness of a sinner, and to fulfil all righteousness (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 3:15</reflink>).</description>
    <description>The official duty of Christ and the sinless person of Christ are to be distinguished. It was in his official capacity that he submitted to baptism. In coming to John our Lord virtually said, "Though sinless, and without any personal taint, yet in my public or official capacity as the Sent of God, I stand in the room of many, and bring with me the sin of the world, for which I am the propitiation." Christ was not made under the law on his own account. It was as surety of his people, a position which he spontaneously assumed. The administration of the rite of baptism was also a symbol of the baptism of suffering before him in this official capacity (<reflink target="XXX">Luke 12:50</reflink>). In thus presenting himself he in effect dedicated or consecrated himself to the work of fulfilling all righteousness.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Baptism, Christian">
    <description>an ordinance immediately instituted by Christ (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 28:19, 20</reflink>), and designed to be observed in the church, like that of the Supper, "till he come." The words "baptize" and "baptism" are simply Greek words transferred into English. This was necessarily done by the translators of the Scriptures, for no literal translation could properly express all that is implied in them.</description>
    <description>The mode of baptism can in no way be determined from the Greek word rendered "baptize." Baptists say that it means "to dip," and nothing else. That is an incorrect view of the meaning of the word. It means both (1) to dip a thing into an element or liquid, and (2) to put an element or liquid over or on it. Nothing therefore as to the mode of baptism can be concluded from the mere word used. The word has a wide latitude of meaning, not only in the New Testament, but also in the LXX. Version of the Old Testament, where it is used of the ablutions and baptisms required by the Mosaic law. These were effected by immersion, and by affusion and sprinkling; and the same word, "washings" (<reflink target="XXX">Heb. 9:10, 13, 19, 21</reflink>) or "baptisms," designates them all. In the New Testament there cannot be found a single well-authenticated instance of the occurrence of the word where it necessarily means immersion. Moreover, none of the instances of baptism recorded in the Acts of the Apostles (2:38-41; 8:26-39; 9:17, 18; 22:12-16; 10:44-48; 16:32-34) favours the idea that it was by dipping the person baptized, or by immersion, while in some of them such a mode was highly improbable.</description>
    <description>The gospel and its ordinances are designed for the whole world, and it cannot be supposed that a form for the administration of baptism would have been prescribed which would in any place (as in a tropical country or in polar regions) or under any circumstances be inapplicable or injurious or impossible.</description>
    <description>Baptism and the Lord's Supper are the two symbolical ordinances of the New Testament. The Supper represents the work of Christ, and Baptism the work of the Spirit. As in the Supper a small amount of bread and wine used in this ordinance exhibits in symbol the great work of Christ, so in Baptism the work of the Holy Spirit is fully seen in the water poured or sprinkled on the person in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. That which is essential in baptism is only "washing with water," no mode being specified and none being necessary or essential to the symbolism of the ordinance.</description>
    <description>The apostles of our Lord were baptized with the Holy Ghost (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 3:11</reflink>) by his coming upon them (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 1:8</reflink>). The fire also with which they were baptized sat upon them. The extraordinary event of Pentecost was explained by Peter as a fulfilment of the ancient promise that the Spirit would be poured out in the last days (2:17). He uses also with the same reference the expression shed forth as descriptive of the baptism of the Spirit (33). In the Pentecostal baptism "the apostles were not dipped into the Spirit, nor plunged into the Spirit; but the Spirit was shed forth, poured out, fell on them (11:15), came upon them, sat on them." That was a real and true baptism. We are warranted from such language to conclude that in like manner when water is poured out, falls, comes upon or rests upon a person when this ordinance is administered, that person is baptized. Baptism is therefore, in view of all these arguments "rightly administered by pouring or sprinkling water upon the person."</description>
    <description>The subjects of baptism. This raises questions of greater importance than those relating to its mode.</description>
    <description>1. The controversy here is not about "believers' baptism," for that is common to all parties. Believers were baptized in apostolic times, and they have been baptized in all time by all the branches of the church. It is altogether a misrepresentation to allege, as is sometimes done by Baptists, that their doctrine is "believers' baptism." Every instance of adult baptism, or of "believers' baptism," recorded in the New Testament (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 2:41; 8:37; 9:17, 18; 10:47; 16:15; 19:5, etc.</reflink>) is just such as would be dealt with in precisely the same way by all branches of the Protestant Church, a profession of faith or of their being "believers" would be required from every one of them before baptism. The point in dispute is not the baptism of believers, but whether the infant children of believers, i.e., of members of the church, ought to be baptized.</description>
    <description>2. In support of the doctrine of infant baptism, i.e., of the baptism of the infants, or rather the "children," of believing parents, the following considerations may be adduced:</description>
    <description>The Church of Christ exists as a divinely organized community. It is the "kingdom of God," one historic kingdom under all dispensations. The commonwealth of Israel was the "church" (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 7:38; Rom. 9:4</reflink>) under the Mosaic dispensation. The New Testament church is not a new and different church, but one with that of the Old Testament. The terms of admission into the church have always been the same viz., a profession of faith and a promise of subjection to the laws of the kingdom. Now it is a fact beyond dispute that the children of God's people under the old dispensation were recognized as members of the church. Circumcision was the sign and seal of their membership. It was not because of carnal descent from Abraham, but as being the children of God's professing people, that this rite was administered (<reflink target="XXX">Rom. 4:11</reflink>). If children were members of the church under the old dispensation, which they undoubtedly were, then they are members of the church now by the same right, unless it can be shown that they have been expressly excluded. Under the Old Testament parents acted for their children and represented them. (<reflink target="XXX">See Gen. 9:9; 17:10; Ex. 24:7, 8; Deut. 29:9-13.</reflink>) When parents entered into covenant with God, they brought their children with them. This was a law in the Hebrew Church. When a proselyte was received into membership, he could not enter without bringing his children with him. The New Testament does not exclude the children of believers from the church. It does not deprive them of any privilege they enjoyed under the Old Testament. There is no command or statement of any kind, that can be interpreted as giving any countenance to such an idea, anywhere to be found in the New Testament. The church membership of infants has never been set aside. The ancient practice, orginally appointed by God himself, must remain a law of his kingdom till repealed by the same divine authority. There are lambs in the fold of the Good Shepherd (<reflink target="XXX">John 21:15; comp. Luke 1:15; Matt. 19:14; 1 Cor. 7:14</reflink>).</description>
    <description>"In a company of converts applying for admission into Christ's house there are likely to be some heads of families. How is their case to be treated? How, for example, are Lydia and her neighbour the keeper of the city prison to be treated? Both have been converted. Both are heads of families. They desire to be received into the infant church of Philippi. What is Christ's direction to them? Shall we say that it is to this effect: 'Arise, and wash away your sins, and come into my house. But you must come in by yourselves. These babes in your arms, you must leave them outside. They cannot believe yet, and so they cannot come in. Those other little ones by your side, their hearts may perhaps have been touched with the love of God; still, they are not old enough to make a personal profession, so they too must be left outside...For the present you must leave them where they are and come in by yourselves.' One may reasonably demand very stringent proofs before accepting this as a fair representation of the sort of welcome Christ offers to parents who come to his door bringing their children with them. Surely it is more consonant with all we know about him to suppose that his welcome will be more ample in its scope, and will breathe a more gracious tone. Surely it would be more like the Good Shepherd to say, 'Come in, and bring your little ones along with you. The youngest needs my salvation; and the youngest is accessible to my salvation. You may be unable as yet to deal with them about either sin or salvation, but my gracious power can find its way into their hearts even now. I can impart to them pardon and a new life. From Adam they have inherited sin and death; and I can so unite them to myself that in me they shall be heirs of righteousness and life. You may without misgiving bring them to me. And the law of my house requires that the same day which witnesses your reception into it by baptism must witness their reception also'" (The Church, by Professor Binnie, D.D.).</description>

  <item id="Barnabas">
    <description>son of consolation, the surname of Joses, a Levite (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 4:36</reflink>). His name stands first on the list of prophets and teachers of the church at Antioch (13:1). Luke speaks of him as a "good man" (11:24). He was born of Jewish parents of the tribe of Levi. He was a native of Cyprus, where he had a possession of land (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 4:36, 37</reflink>), which he sold. His personal appearance is supposed to have been dignified and commanding (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 14:11, 12</reflink>). When Paul returned to Jerusalem after his conversion, Barnabas took him and introduced him to the apostles (9:27). They had probably been companions as students in the school of Gamaliel.</description>
    <description>The prosperity of the church at Antioch led the apostles and brethren at Jerusalem to send Barnabas thither to superintend the movement. He found the work so extensive and weighty that he went to Tarsus in search of Saul to assist him. Saul returned with him to Antioch and laboured with him for a whole year (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 11:25, 26</reflink>). The two were at the end of this period sent up to Jerusalem with the contributions the church at Antioch had made for the poorer brethren there (11:28-30). Shortly after they returned, bringing John Mark with them, they were appointed as missionaries to the heathen world, and in this capacity visited Cyprus and some of the principal cities of Asia Minor (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 13:14</reflink>). Returning from this first missionary journey to Antioch, they were again sent up to Jerusalem to consult with the church there regarding the relation of Gentiles to the church (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 15:2: Gal. 2:1</reflink>). This matter having been settled, they returned again to Antioch, bringing the decree of the council as the rule by which Gentiles were to be admitted into the church.</description>
    <description>When about to set forth on a second missionary journey, a dispute arose between Saul and Barnabas as to the propriety of taking John Mark with them again. The dispute ended by Saul and Barnabas taking separate routes. Saul took Silas as his companion, and journeyed through Syria and Cilicia; while Barnabas took his nephew John Mark, and visited Cyprus (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 15:36-41</reflink>). Barnabas is not again mentioned by Luke in the Acts.</description>

  <item id="Barrel">
    <description>a vessel used for keeping flour (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 17:12, 14, 16</reflink>). The same word (cad) so rendered is also translated "pitcher," a vessel for carrying water (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 24:14; Judg. 7:16</reflink>).</description>

  <item id="Barsabas">
    <description>son of Saba, the surname (1) of Joseph, also called Justus (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 1:23</reflink>), some identify him with Barnabas; (2) of Judas, who was a "prophet." Nothing more is known of him than what is mentioned in Acts 15:32.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Bartholomew">
    <description>son of Tolmai, one of the twelve apostles (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 10:3; Acts 1:13</reflink>); generally supposed to have been the same as Nathanael. In the synoptic gospels Philip and Bartholomew are always mentioned together, while Nathanael is never mentioned; in the fourth gospel, on the other hand, Philip and Nathanael are similarly mentioned together, but nothing is said of Bartholomew. He was one of the disciples to whom our Lord appeared at the Sea of Tiberias after his resurrection (<reflink target="XXX">John 21:2</reflink>). He was also a witness of the Ascension (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 1:4, 12, 13</reflink>). He was an "Israelite indeed" (<reflink target="XXX">John 1:47</reflink>).</description>

  <item id="Bartimaeus">
    <description>son of Timaeus, one of the two blind beggars of Jericho (<reflink target="XXX">Mark 10:46; Matt. 20:30</reflink>). His blindness was miraculously cured on the ground of his faith.</description>

  <item id="Baruch">
    <description>blessed. (1.) The secretary of the prophet Jeremiah (32:12; 36:4). He was of the tribe of Judah (51:59). To him Jeremiah dictated his prophecies regarding the invasion of the Babylonians and the Captivity. These he read to the people from a window in the temple in the fourth year of the reign of Jehoiakim, king of Judah (Jer. 36). He afterwards read them before the counsellors of the king at a private interview; and then to the king himself, who, after hearing a part of the roll, cut it with a penknife, and threw it into the fire of his winter parlour, where he was sitting.</description>
    <description>During the siege of Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar, he was the keeper of the deed of purchase Jeremiah had made of the territory of Hanameel (<reflink target="XXX">Jer. 32:12</reflink>). Being accused by his enemies of favouring the Chaldeans, he was cast, with Jeremiah, into prison, where he remained till the capture of Jerusalem (B.C. 586). He probably died in Babylon.</description>

  <item id="Bashan">
    <description>light soil, first mentioned in Gen. 14:5, where it is said that Chedorlaomer and his confederates "smote the Rephaim in Ashteroth," where Og the king of Bashan had his residence. At the time of Israel's entrance into the Promised Land, Og came out against them, but was utterly routed (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 21:33-35; Deut. 3:1-7</reflink>). This country extended from Gilead in the south to Hermon in the north, and from the Jordan on the west to Salcah on the east. Along with the half of Gilead it was given to the half-tribe of Manasseh (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 13:29-31</reflink>). Golan, one of its cities, became a "city of refuge" (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 21:27</reflink>). Argob, in Bashan, was one of Solomon's commissariat districts (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 4:13</reflink>). The cities of Bashan were taken by Hazael (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 10:33</reflink>), but were soon after reconquered by Jehoash (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 13:25</reflink>), who overcame the Syrians in three battles, according to the word of Elisha (19). From this time Bashan almost disappears from history, although we read of the wild cattle of its rich pastures (<reflink target="XXX">Ezek. 39:18; Ps. 22:12</reflink>), the oaks of its forests (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 2:13; Ezek. 27:6; Zech. 11:2</reflink>), and the beauty of its extensive plains (<reflink target="XXX">Amos 4:1; Jer. 50:19</reflink>). Soon after the conquest, the name "Gilead" was given to the whole country beyond Jordan. After the Exile, Bashan was divided into four districts, (1.) Gaulonitis, or Jaulan, the most western; (2.) Auranitis, the Hauran (<reflink target="XXX">Ezek. 47:16</reflink>); (3.) Argob or Trachonitis, now the Lejah; and (4.) Batanaea, now Ard-el-Bathanyeh, on the east of the Lejah, with many deserted towns almost as perfect as when they were inhabited. (<see target="x-self">See HAURAN.</see>)</description>

She is also called Mahalath (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 28:9</reflink>). It is noticeable that Esau's three wives receive different names in the genealogical table of the Edomites (Gen. 36) from those given to them in the history (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 26:34; 28:9</reflink>).</description>

  <item id="Basin">
    <description>or Bason. (1.) A trough or laver (Heb. aggan') for washing (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 24:6</reflink>); rendered also "goblet" (<reflink target="XXX">Cant. 7:2</reflink>) and "cups" (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 22:24</reflink>).</description>

    <description>(3.) A vase (Heb. mizrak) from which to sprinkle anything. A metallic vessel; sometimes rendered "bowl" (<reflink target="XXX">Amos 6:6; Zech. 9:15</reflink>).

    <description>The various vessels spoken of by the names "basin, bowl, charger, cup, and dish," cannot now be accurately distinguished.</description>
    <description>The basin in which our Lord washed the disciples' feet (<reflink target="XXX">John 13:5</reflink>) must have been larger and deeper than the hand-basin.</description>

  <item id="Basket">
    <description>There are five different Hebrew words so rendered in the Authorized Version: (1.) A basket (Heb. sal, a twig or osier) for holding bread (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 40:16; Ex. 29:3, 23; Lev. 8:2, 26, 31; Num. 6:15, 17, 19</reflink>). Sometimes baskets were made of twigs peeled; their manufacture was a recognized trade among the Hebrews.</description>
    <description>(2.) That used (Heb. salsilloth') in gathering grapes (<reflink target="XXX">Jer. 6:9</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(3.) That in which the first fruits of the harvest were presented, Heb. tene, (<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 26:2, 4</reflink>). It was also used for household purposes. In form it tapered downwards like that called _corbis_ by the Romans.</description>
    <description>(4.) A basket (Heb. kelub) having a lid, resembling a bird-cage. It was made of leaves or rushes. The name is also applied to fruit-baskets (<reflink target="XXX">Amos 8:1, 2</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(5.) A basket (Heb. dud) for carrying figs (<reflink target="XXX">Jer. 24:2</reflink>), also clay to the brick-yard (R.V., Ps. 81:6), and bulky articles (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 10:7</reflink>). This word is also rendered in the Authorized Version "kettle" (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 2:14</reflink>), "caldron" (<reflink target="XXX">2 Chr. 35:13</reflink>), "seething-pot" (<reflink target="XXX">Job 41:20</reflink>).</description>
    <description>In the New Testament mention is made of the basket (Gr. kophinos, small "wicker-basket") for the "fragments" in the miracle recorded Mark 6:43, and in that recorded Matt. 15:37 (Gr. spuris, large "rope-basket"); also of the basket in which Paul escaped (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 9:25, Gr. spuris; 2 Cor. 11: 33, Gr. sargane, "basket of plaited cords"</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Bastard">
    <description>In the Old Testament the rendering of the Hebrew word _mamzer'_, which means "polluted." In Deut. 23:2, it occurs in the ordinary sense of illegitimate offspring. In Zech. 9:6, the word is used in the sense of foreigner. From the history of Jephthah we learn that there were bastard offspring among the Jews (<reflink target="XXX">Judg. 11:1-7</reflink>). In Heb. 12:8, the word (Gr. nothoi) is used in its ordinary sense, and denotes those who do not share the privileges of God's children.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Bastinado">
    <description>beating, a mode of punishment common in the East. It is referred to by "the rod of correction" (<reflink target="XXX">Prov. 22:15</reflink>), "scourging" (<reflink target="XXX">Lev. 19:20</reflink>), "chastising" (<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 22:18</reflink>).

  <item id="Bat">
    <description>The Hebrew word (atalleph') so rendered (<reflink target="XXX">Lev. 11:19; Deut. 14:18</reflink>) implies "flying in the dark." The bat is reckoned among the birds in the list of unclean animals. To cast idols to the "moles and to the bats" means to carry them into dark caverns or desolate places to which these animals resort (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 2:20</reflink>), i.e., to consign them to desolation or ruin.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Bath">
    <description>a Hebrew liquid measure, the tenth part of an homer (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 7:26, 38; Ezek. 45:10, 14</reflink>). It contained 8 gallons 3 quarts of our measure.

  <item id="Bath-sheba">
    <description>daughter of the oath, or of seven, called also Bath-shu'a (<reflink target="XXX">1 Chr. 3:5</reflink>), was the daughter of Eliam (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 11:3</reflink>) or Ammiel (<reflink target="XXX">1 Chr. 3:5</reflink>), and wife of Uriah the Hittite. David committed adultery with her (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 11:4, 5; Ps. 51:1</reflink>). The child born in adultery died (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 12:15-19</reflink>). After her husband was slain (11:15) she was married to David (11:27), and became the mother of Solomon (12:24; 1 Kings 1:11; 2:13). She took a prominent part in securing the succession of Solomon to the throne (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 1:11, 16-21</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Baths">
    <description>The use of the bath was very frequent among the Hebrews (<reflink target="XXX">Lev. 14:8; Num. 19:19, ect.</reflink>). The high priest at his inauguration (<reflink target="XXX">Lev. 8:6</reflink>), and on the day of atonement, was required to bathe himself (16:4, 24). The "pools" mentioned in Neh. 3:15, 16, 2 Kings 20:20, Isa. 22:11, John 9:7, were public bathing-places.</description>

  <item id="Battering-ram">
    <description>(<reflink target="XXX">Ezek. 4:2; 21:22</reflink>), a military engine, consisting of a long beam of wood hung upon a frame, for making breaches in walls. The end of it which was brought against the wall was shaped like a ram's head.</description>

  </item>
  <item id="Battle-bow">
    <description>the war-bow used in fighting (<reflink target="XXX">Zech. 9:10; 10:4</reflink>). "Thy bow was made quite naked" (<reflink target="XXX">Hab. 3:9</reflink>) means that it was made ready for use. By David's order (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 1:18</reflink>) the young men were taught the use, or rather the song of the bow. (<see target="x-self">See ARMOUR, BOW.</see>)</description>

  <item id="Battlement">
    <description>a parapet wall or balustrade surrounding the flat roofs of the houses, required to be built by a special law (<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 22:8</reflink>). In Jer. 5:10, it denotes the parapet of a city wall.</description>

  <item id="Bay">
    <description>denotes the estuary of the Dead Sea at the mouth of the Jordan (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 15:5; 18:19</reflink>), also the southern extremity of the same sea (15:2). The same Hebrew word is rendered "tongue" in Isa. 11:15, where it is used with reference to the forked mouths of the Nile.</description>
    <description>Bay in Zech. 6:3, 7 denotes the colour of horses, but the original Hebrew means strong, and is here used rather to describe the horses as fleet or spirited.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Bay tree">
    <description>named only in Ps. 37:35, Authorized Version. The Hebrew word so rendered is _ereh_, which simply means "native born", i.e., a tree not transplanted, but growing on its native soil, and therefore luxuriantly. If the psalmist intended by this word to denote any particular tree, it may have been the evergreen bay laurel (Laurus nobilis), which is a native of Palestine. Instead of "like a green bay tree" in the Authorized Version, the Revised Version has, "like a green tree in its native soil."</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Bdellium">
    <description>occurs only in Gen. 2:12, where it designates a product of the land of Havilah; and in Num. 11:7, where the manna is likened to it in colour. It was probably an aromatic gum like balsam which exuded from a particular tree (Borassus flabelliformis) still found in Arabia, Media, and India. It bears a resemblance in colour to myrrh. Others think the word denotes "pearls," or some precious stone.</description>

  <item id="Beacon">
    <description>a pole (Heb. to'ren) used as a standard or ensign set on the tops of mountains as a call to the people to assemble themselves for some great national purpose (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 30:17</reflink>).

  <item id="Bealoth">
    <description>citizens, a town in the extreme south of Judah (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 15:24</reflink>); probably the same as Baalath-beer (19:8). In 1 Kings 4:16, the Authorized Version has "in Aloth," the Revised Version "Bealoth."</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Beam">
    <description>occurs in the Authorized Version as the rendering of various Hebrew words. In 1 Sam. 17:7, it means a weaver's frame or principal beam; in Hab. 2:11, a crossbeam or girder; 2 Kings 6:2, 5, a cross-piece or rafter of a house; 1 Kings 7:6, an architectural ornament as a projecting step or moulding; Ezek. 41:25, a thick plank. In the New Testament the word occurs only in Matt. 7:3, 4, 5, and Luke 6:41, 42, where it means (Gr. dokos) a large piece of wood used for building purposes, as contrasted with "mote" (Gr. karphos), a small piece or mere splinter. "Mote" and "beam" became proverbial for little and great faults.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Beans">
    <description>mentioned in 2 Sam. 17:28 as having been brought to David when flying from Absalom. They formed a constituent in the bread Ezekiel (4:9) was commanded to make, as they were in general much used as an article of diet. They are extensively cultivated in Egypt and Arabia and Syria.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Bear">
    <description>a native of the mountain regions of Western Asia, frequently mentioned in Scripture. David defended his flocks against the attacks of a bear (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 17:34-37</reflink>). Bears came out of the wood and destroyed the children who mocked the prophet Elisha (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 2:24</reflink>). Their habits are referred to in Isa. 59:11; Prov. 28:15; Lam. 3:10. The fury of the female bear when robbed of her young is spoken of (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 17:8; Prov. 17:12; Hos. 13:8</reflink>). In Daniel's vision of the four great monarchies, the Medo-Persian empire is represented by a bear (7:5).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Beard">
    <description>The mode of wearing it was definitely prescribed to the Jews (<reflink target="XXX">Lev. 19:27; 21:5</reflink>). Hence the import of Ezekiel's (5:1-4) description of the "razor" i.e., the agents of an angry providence being used against the guilty nation of the Jews. It was a part of a Jew's daily toilet to anoint his beard with oil and perfume (<reflink target="XXX">Ps. 133:2</reflink>). Beards were trimmed with the most fastidious care (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 19:24</reflink>), and their neglet was an indication of deep sorrow (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 15:2; Jer. 41:5</reflink>). The custom was to shave or pluck off the hair as a sign of mourning (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 50:6; Jer. 48:37; Ezra 9:3</reflink>). The beards of David's ambassadors were cut off by hanun (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 10:4</reflink>) as a mark of indignity.</description>
    <description>On the other hand, the Egyptians carefully shaved the hair off their faces, and they compelled their slaves to do so also (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 41:14</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Beast">
    <description>This word is used of flocks or herds of grazing animals (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 22:5; Num. 20:4, 8, 11; Ps. 78:48</reflink>); of beasts of burden (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 45:17</reflink>); of eatable beasts (<reflink target="XXX">Prov. 9:2</reflink>); and of swift beasts or dromedaries (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 60:6</reflink>). In the New Testament it is used of a domestic animal as property (<reflink target="XXX">Rev. 18:13</reflink>); as used for food (<reflink target="XXX">1 Cor. 15:39</reflink>), for service (<reflink target="XXX">Luke 10:34; Acts 23:24</reflink>), and for sacrifice (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 7:42</reflink>).</description>
    <description>When used in contradistinction to man (<reflink target="XXX">Ps. 36:6</reflink>), it denotes a brute creature generally, and when in contradistinction to creeping things (<reflink target="XXX">Lev. 11:2-7; 27:26</reflink>), a four-footed animal.</description>
    <description>The Mosaic law required that beasts of labour should have rest on the Sabbath (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 20:10; 23:12</reflink>), and in the Sabbatical year all cattle were allowed to roam about freely, and eat whatever grew in the fields (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 23:11; Lev. 25:7</reflink>). No animal could be castrated (<reflink target="XXX">Lev. 22:24</reflink>). Animals of different kinds were to be always kept separate (<reflink target="XXX">Lev. 19:19; Deut. 22:10</reflink>). Oxen when used in threshing were not to be prevented from eating what was within their reach (<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 25:4; 1 Cor.9:9</reflink>).</description>
    <description>This word is used figuratively of an infuriated multitude (<reflink target="XXX">1 Cor. 15:32; Acts 19:29; comp. Ps. 22:12, 16; Eccl. 3:18; Isa. 11:6-8</reflink>), and of wicked men (<reflink target="XXX">2 Pet. 2:12</reflink>). The four beasts of Daniel 7:3, 17, 23 represent four kingdoms or kings.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Beaten gold">
    <description>in Num. 8:4, means "turned" or rounded work in gold. The Greek Version, however, renders the word "solid gold;" the Revised Version, "beaten work of gold." In 1 Kings 10:16, 17, it probably means "mixed" gold, as the word ought to be rendered, i.e., not pure gold. Others render the word in these places "thin plates of gold."</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Beaten oil">
    <description>(<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 27:20; 29:40</reflink>), obtained by pounding olives in a mortar, not by crushing them in a mill. It was reckoned the best. (See OLIVE</description>

  <item id="Beautiful gate">
    <description>the name of one of the gates of the temple (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 3:2</reflink>). It is supposed to have been the door which led from the court of the Gentiles to the court of the women. It was of massive structure, and covered with plates of Corinthian brass.</description>

  <item id="Becher">
    <description>first-born; a youth, the second son of Benjamin (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 46:21</reflink>), who came down to Egypt with Jacob. It is probable that he married an Ephraimitish heiress, and that his descendants were consequently reckoned among the tribe of Ephraim (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 26:35; 1 Chr. 7:20, 21</reflink>). They are not reckoned among the descendants of Benjamin (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 26:38</reflink>).</description>

    <description>(Heb. mittah), for rest at night (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 8:3; 1 Sam. 19:13, 15, 16, etc.</reflink>); during sickness (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 47:31; 48:2; 49:33, etc.</reflink>); as a sofa for rest (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 28:23; Amos 3:12</reflink>). Another Hebrew word (er'es) so rendered denotes a canopied bed, or a bed with curtains (<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 3:11; Ps. 132:3</reflink>), for sickness (<reflink target="XXX">Ps. 6:6; 41:3</reflink>).</description>
    <description>In the New Testament it denotes sometimes a litter with a coverlet (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 9:2, 6; Luke 5:18; Acts 5:15</reflink>).</description>
    <description>The Jewish bedstead was frequently merely the divan or platform along the sides of the house, sometimes a very slight portable frame, sometimes only a mat or one or more quilts. The only material for bed-clothes is mentioned in 1 Sam. 19:13. Sleeping in the open air was not uncommon, the sleeper wrapping himself in his outer garment (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 22:26,27; Deut. 24:12,13</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Bed-chamber">
    <description>an apartment in Eastern houses, furnished with a slightly elevated platform at the upper end and sometimes along the sides, on which were laid mattresses. This was the general arrangement of the public sleeping-room for the males of the family and for guests, but there were usually besides distinct bed-chambers of a more private character (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 4:10; Ex. 8:3; 2 Kings 6:12</reflink>). In 2 Kings 11:2 this word denotes, as in the margin of the Revised Version, a store-room in which mattresses were kept.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Bedan">
    <description>one of the judges of Israel (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 12:11</reflink>). It is uncertain who he was. Some suppose that Barak is meant, others Samson, but most probably this is a contracted form of Abdon (<reflink target="XXX">Judg. 12:13</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Bedstead">
    <description>used in Deut. 3:11, but elsewhere rendered "couch," "bed." In 2 Kings 1:4; 16:2; Ps. 132:3; Amos 3:12, the divan is meant by this word.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Bee">
    <description>First mentioned in Deut. 1:44. Swarms of bees, and the danger of their attacks, are mentioned in Ps. 118:12. Samson found a "swarm of bees" in the carcass of a lion he had slain (<reflink target="XXX">Judg. 14:8</reflink>). Wild bees are described as laying up honey in woods and in clefts of rocks (<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 32:13; Ps. 81:16</reflink>). In Isa. 7:18 the "fly" and the "bee" are personifications of the Egyptians and Assyrians, the inveterate enemies of Israel.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Beelzebub">
    <description>(Gr. form Beel'zebul), the name given to Satan, and found only in the New Testament (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 10:25; 12:24, 27; Mark 3:22</reflink>). It is probably the same as Baalzebub (q.v.), the god of Ekron, meaning "the lord of flies," or, as others think, "the lord of dung," or "the dung-god."</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Beer">
    <description>well. (1.) A place where a well was dug by the direction of Moses, at the forty-fourth station of the Hebrews in their wanderings (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 21:16-18</reflink>) in the wilderness of Moab. (See WELL</description>
    <description>(2.) A town in the tribe of Judah to which Jotham fled for fear of Abimelech (<reflink target="XXX">Judg. 9:21</reflink>). Some have identified this place with Beeroth.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Beer-elim">
    <description>well of heroes, probably the name given to Beer, the place where the chiefs of Israel dug a well (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 21:16; Isa. 15:8</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Beer-lahai-roi">
    <description>i.e., "the well of him that liveth and seeth me," or, as some render it, "the well of the vision of life", the well where the Lord met with Hagar (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 16:7-14</reflink>). Isaac dwelt beside this well (24:62; 25:11). It has been identified with 'Ain Muweileh, or Moilahhi, south-west of Beersheba, and about 12 miles W. from Kadesh-barnea.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Beeri">
    <description>illustrious, or the well-man. (1.) The father of Judith, one of the wives of Esau (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 26:34</reflink>), the same as Adah (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 36:2</reflink>). (2.) The father of the prophet Hosea (1:1).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Beeroth">
    <description>wells, one of the four cities of the Hivites which entered by fraud into a league with Joshua. It belonged to Benjamin (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 18:25</reflink>). It has by some been identified with el-Bireh on the way to Nablus, 10 miles north of Jerusalem.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Beeroth of the children of Jaakan">
    <description>(<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 10:6</reflink>). The same as Bene-jaakan (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 33:31</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Beersheba">
    <description>well of the oath, or well of seven, a well dug by Abraham, and so named because he and Abimelech here entered into a compact (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 21:31</reflink>). On re-opening it, Isaac gave it the same name (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 26:31-33</reflink>). It was a favourite place of abode of both of these patriarchs (21:33-22:1, 19; 26:33; 28:10). It is mentioned among the "cities" given to the tribe of Simeon (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 19:2; 1 Chr. 4:28</reflink>). From Dan to Beersheba, a distance of about 144 miles (<reflink target="XXX">Judg. 20:1; 1 Chr. 21:2; 2 Sam. 24:2</reflink>), became the usual way of designating the whole Promised Land, and passed into a proverb. After the return from the Captivity the phrase is narrowed into "from Beersheba unto the valley of Hinnom" (<reflink target="XXX">Neh. 11:30</reflink>). The kingdom of the ten tribes extended from Beersheba to Mount Ephraim (<reflink target="XXX">2 Chr. 19:4</reflink>). The name is not found in the New Testament. It is still called by the Arabs Bir es-Seba, i.e., "well of the seven", where there are to the present day two principal wells and five smaller ones. It is nearly midway between the southern end of the Dead Sea and the Mediterranean.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Beetle">
    <description>(Heb. hargol, meaning "leaper"). Mention of it is made only in Lev. 11:22, where it is obvious the word cannot mean properly the beetle. It denotes some winged creeper with at least four feet, "which has legs above its feet, to leap withal." The description plainly points to the locust (q.v.). This has been an article of food from the earliest times in the East to the present day. The word is rendered "cricket" in the Revised Version.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Beeves">
    <description>(an old English plural of the word beef), a name applicable to all ruminating animals except camels, and especially to the Bovidce, or horned cattle (<reflink target="XXX">Lev. 22:19, 21; Num. 31:28, 30, 33, 38, 44</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Beg">
    <description>That the poor existed among the Hebrews we have abundant evidence (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 23:11; Deut. 15:11</reflink>), but there is no mention of beggars properly so called in the Old Testament. The poor were provided for by the law of Moses (<reflink target="XXX">Lev. 19:10; Deut. 12:12; 14:29</reflink>). It is predicted of the seed of the wicked that they shall be beggars (<reflink target="XXX">Ps. 37:25; 109:10</reflink>).</description>
    <description>In the New Testament we find not seldom mention made of beggars (<reflink target="XXX">Mark 10:46; Luke 16:20, 21; Acts 3:2</reflink>), yet there is no mention of such a class as vagrant beggars, so numerous in the East. "Beggarly," in Gal. 4:9, means worthless.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Behead">
    <description>a method of taking away life practised among the Egyptians (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 40:17-19</reflink>). There are instances of this mode of punishment also among the Hebrews (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 4:8; 20:21,22; 2 Kings 10:6-8</reflink>). It is also mentioned in the New Testament (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 14:8-12; Acts 12:2</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Behemoth">
    <description>(<reflink target="XXX">Job 40:15-24</reflink>). Some have supposed this to be an Egyptian word meaning a "water-ox." The Revised Version has here in the margin "hippopotamus," which is probably the correct rendering of the word. The word occurs frequently in Scripture, but, except here, always as a common name, and translated "beast" or "cattle."</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Bekah">
    <description>Both the name and its explanation, "a half shekel," are given in Ex. 38:26. The word properly means a "division," a "part." (R.V., "beka.")</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Bel">
    <description>the Aramaic form of Baal, the national god of the Babylonians (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 46:1; Jer. 50:2; 51:44</reflink>). It signifies "lord." (See BAAL</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Bela">
    <description>a thing swallowed. (1.) A city on the shore of the Dead Sea, not far from Sodom, called also Zoar. It was the only one of the five cities that was spared at Lot's intercession (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 19:20,23</reflink>). It is first mentioned in Gen. 14:2,8.</description>
    <description>(2.) The eldest son of Benjamin (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 26:38; "Belah," Gen. 46:21</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(3.) The son of Beor, and a king of Edom (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 36:32, 33; 1 Chr. 1:43</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(4.) A son of Azaz (<reflink target="XXX">1 Chr. 5:8</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Belial">
    <description>worthlessness, frequently used in the Old Testament as a proper name. It is first used in Deut. 13:13. In the New Testament it is found only in 2 Cor. 6:15, where it is used as a name of Satan, the personification of all that is evil. It is translated "wicked" in Deut. 15:9; Ps. 41:8 (R.V. marg.); 101:3; Prov. 6:12, etc. The expression "son" or "man of Belial" means simply a worthless, lawless person (<reflink target="XXX">Judg. 19:22; 20:13; 1 Sam. 1:16; 2:12</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Bell">
    <description>The bells first mentioned in Scripture are the small golden bells attached to the hem of the high priest's ephod (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 28:33, 34, 35</reflink>). The "bells of the horses" mentioned by Zechariah (14:20) were attached to the bridles or belts round the necks of horses trained for war, so as to accustom them to noise and tumult.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Bellows">
    <description>occurs only in Jer. 6:29, in relation to the casting of metal. Probably they consisted of leather bags similar to those common in Egypt.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Belly">
    <description>the seat of the carnal affections (<reflink target="XXX">Titus 1:12; Phil. 3:19; Rom. 16:18</reflink>). The word is used symbolically for the heart (<reflink target="XXX">Prov. 18:8; 20:27; 22:18, marg.</reflink>). The "belly of hell" signifies the grave or underworld (<reflink target="XXX">Jonah 2:2</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Belshazzar">
    <description>Bel protect the king!, the last of the kings of Babylon (<reflink target="XXX">Dan. 5:1</reflink>). He was the son of Nabonidus by Nitocris, who was the daughter of Nebuchadnezzar and the widow of Nergal-sharezer. When still young he made a great feast to a thousand of his lords, and when heated with wine sent for the sacred vessels his "father" (<reflink target="XXX">Dan. 5:2</reflink>), or grandfather, Nebuchadnezzar had carried away from the temple in Jerusalem, and he and his princes drank out of them. In the midst of their mad revelry a hand was seen by the king tracing on the wall the announcement of God's judgment, which that night fell upon him. At the instance of the queen (i.e., his mother) Daniel was brought in, and he interpreted the writing. That night the kingdom of the Chaldeans came to an end, and the king was slain (<reflink target="XXX">Dan. 5:30</reflink>). (<see target="x-self">See NERGAL-SHAREZER.</see>)</description>
    <description>The absence of the name of Belshazzar on the monuments was long regarded as an argument against the genuineness of the Book of Daniel. In 1854 Sir Henry Rawlinson found an inscription of Nabonidus which referred to his eldest son. Quite recently, however, the side of a ravine undermined by heavy rains fell at Hillah, a suburb of Babylon. A number of huge, coarse earthenware vases were laid bare. These were filled with tablets, the receipts and contracts of a firm of Babylonian bankers, which showed that Belshazzar had a household, with secretaries and stewards. One was dated in the third year of the king Marduk-sar-uzur. As Marduk-sar-uzar was another name for Baal, this Marduk-sar-uzur was found to be the Belshazzar of Scripture. In one of these contract tablets, dated in the July after the defeat of the army of Nabonidus, we find him paying tithes for his sister to the temple of the sun-god at Sippara.</description>

    <description>(2.) Son of the preceding, also king of Syria. He was long engaged in war against Israel. He was murdered probably by Hazael, by whom he was succeeded (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 8:7-15</reflink>), after a reign of some thirty years.</description>
    <description>(3.) King of Damascus, and successor of his father Hazael on the throne of Syria (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 13:3, 4</reflink>). His misfortunes in war are noticed by Amos (1:4).</description>

  <item id="Benaiah">
    <description>built up by Jehovah. (1.) The son of Jehoiada, chief priest (<reflink target="XXX">1 Chr. 27:5</reflink>). He was set by David over his body-guard of Cherethites and Pelethites (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 8:18; 1 Kings 1:32; 1 Chr. 18:17</reflink>). His exploits are enumerated in 2 Sam. 23:20, 21, 22; 1 Chr. 11:22. He remained faithful to Solomon (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 1:8, 10, 26</reflink>), by whom he was raised to the rank of commander-in-chief (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 2:25, 29, 30, 34, 35; 4:4</reflink>).</description>

  <item id="Benjamin">
    <description>son of my right hand. (1.) The younger son of Jacob by Rachel (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 35:18</reflink>). His birth took place at Ephrath, on the road between Bethel and Bethlehem, at a short distance from the latter place. His mother died in giving him birth, and with her last breath named him Ben-oni, son of my pain, a name which was changed by his father into Benjamin. His posterity are called Benjamites (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 49:27; Deut. 33:12; Josh. 18:21</reflink>).</description>
    <description>The tribe of Benjamin at the Exodus was the smallest but one (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 1:36, 37; Ps. 68:27</reflink>). During the march its place was along with Manasseh and Ephraim on the west of the tabernacle. At the entrance into Canaan it counted 45,600 warriors. It has been inferred by some from the words of Jacob (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 49:27</reflink>) that the figure of a wolf was on the tribal standard. This tribe is mentioned in Rom. 11:1; Phil. 3:5.</description>
    <description>The inheritance of this tribe lay immediately to the south of that of Ephraim, and was about 26 miles in length and 12 in breadth. Its eastern boundary was the Jordan. Dan intervened between it and the Philistines. Its chief towns are named in Josh. 18:21-28.</description>
    <description>The history of the tribe contains a sad record of a desolating civil war in which they were engaged with the other eleven tribes. By it they were almost exterminated (<reflink target="XXX">Judg. 20:20, 21; 21:10</reflink>). (<see target="x-self">See GIBEAH.</see>)</description>
    <description>The first king of the Jews was Saul, a Benjamite. A close alliance was formed between this tribe and that of Judah in the time of David (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 19:16, 17</reflink>), which continued after his death (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 11:13; 12:20</reflink>). After the Exile these two tribes formed the great body of the Jewish nation (<reflink target="XXX">Ezra 1:5; 10:9</reflink>).</description>
    <description>The tribe of Benjamin was famous for its archers (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 20:20, 36; 2 Sam. 1:22; 1 Chr. 8:40; 12:2</reflink>) and slingers (<reflink target="XXX">Judge. 20:6</reflink>).</description>
    <description>The gate of Benjamin, on the north side of Jerusalem (<reflink target="XXX">Jer. 37:13; 38:7; Zech. 14:10</reflink>), was so called because it led in the direction of the territory of the tribe of Benjamin. It is called by Jeremiah (20:2) "the high gate of Benjamin;" also "the gate of the children of the people" (17:19). (Comp. 2 Kings 14:13.)</description>

Sopater, one of Paul's companions belonged to this city, and his conversion probably took place at this time (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 20:4</reflink>). It is now called Verria.</description>

  <item id="Beryl">
    <description>the rendering in the Authorized Version of the Hebrew word _tarshish_, a precious stone; probably so called as being brought from Tarshish. It was one of the stones on the breastplate of the high priest (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 28:20; R.V. marg., "chalcedony;" 39:13</reflink>). The colour of the wheels in Ezekiel's vision was as the colour of a beryl stone (1:16; 10:9; R.V., "stone of Tarshish"). It is mentioned in Cant. 5:14; Dan. 10:6; Rev. 21:20. In Ezek. 28:13 the LXX. render the word by "chrysolite," which the Jewish historian Josephus regards as its proper translation. This also is the rendering given in the Authorized Version in the margin. That was a gold-coloured gem, the topaz of ancient authors.</description>

    <description>house of the desert, one of the six cities of Judah, situated in the sunk valley of the Jordan and Dead Sea (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 18:22</reflink>). In Josh. 15:61 it is said to have been "in the wilderness." It was afterwards included in the towns of Benjamin. It is called Arabah (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 18:18</reflink>).</description>

  <item id="Beth-aram">
    <description>house of the height; i.e., "mountain-house", one of the towns of Gad, 3 miles east of Jordan, opposite Jericho (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 13:27</reflink>). Probably the same as Beth-haran in Num. 32:36. It was called by king Herod, Julias, or Livias, after Livia, the wife of Augustus. It is now called Beit-haran.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Beth-arbel">
    <description>house of God's court, a place alluded to by Hosea (10:14) as the scene of some great military exploit, but not otherwise mentioned in Scripture. The Shalman here named was probably Shalmaneser, the king of Assyria (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 17:3</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Beth-aven">
    <description>house of nothingness; i.e., "of idols", a place in the mountains of Benjamin, east of Bethel (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 7:2; 18:12; 1 Sam. 13:5</reflink>). In Hos. 4:15; 5:8; 10:5 it stands for "Bethel" (q.v.), and it is so called because it was no longer the "house of God," but "the house of idols," referring to the calves there worshipped.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Beth-barah">
    <description>house of crossing, a place south of the scene of Gideon's victory (<reflink target="XXX">Judg. 7:24</reflink>). It was probably the chief ford of the Jordan in that district, and may have been that by which Jacob crossed when he returned from Mesopotamia, near the Jabbok (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 32:22</reflink>), and at which Jephthah slew the Ephraimites (<reflink target="XXX">Judg. 12:4</reflink>). Nothing, however, is certainly known of it. (See BETHABARA</description>

  <item id="Beth-dagon">
    <description>house of Dagon. (1.) A city in the low country or plain of Judah, near Philistia (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 15:41</reflink>); the modern Beit Degan, about 5 miles from Lydda.</description>
    <description>(2.) A city near the south-east border of Asher (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 19:27</reflink>). It was a Philistine colony. It is identical with the modern ruined village of Tell D'auk.</description>

  <item id="Beth-diblathaim">
    <description>house of two cakes of figs, a city of Moab, upon which Jeremiah (48:22) denounced destruction. It is called also Almon-diblathaim (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 33:46</reflink>) and Diblath (<reflink target="XXX">Ezek. 6:14</reflink>). (R.V., "Diblah.")</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Beth-gamul">
    <description>camel-house, a city in the "plain country" of Moab denounced by the prophet (<reflink target="XXX">Jer. 48:23</reflink>); probably the modern Um-el-Jemal, near Bozrah, one of the deserted cities of the Hauran.</description>

  <item id="Beth-gilgal">
    <description>house of Gilgal, a place from which the inhabitants gathered for the purpose of celebrating the rebuilding of the walls on the return exile (<reflink target="XXX">Neh. 12:29</reflink>). (<see target="x-self">See GILGAL.</see>)</description>

  <item id="Beth-haccerem">
    <description>house of a vineyard, a place in the tribe of Judah (<reflink target="XXX">Neh. 3:14</reflink>) where the Benjamites were to set up a beacon when they heard the trumpet against the invading army of the Babylonians (<reflink target="XXX">Jer. 6:1</reflink>). It is probable that this place is the modern 'Ain Karim, or "well of the vineyards," near which there is a ridge on which are cairns which may have served as beacons of old, one of which is 40 feet high and 130 in diameter.</description>

  <item id="Beth-horon">
    <description>house of the hollow, or of the cavern, the name of two towns or villages (<reflink target="XXX">2 Chr. 8:5; 1 Chr. 7:24</reflink>) in the territory of Ephraim, on the way from Jerusalem to Joppa. They are distinguished as Beth-horon "the upper" and Beth-horon "the nether." They are about 2 miles apart, the former being about 10 miles north-west of Jerusalem. Between the two places was the ascent and descent of Beth-horon, leading from Gibeon down to the western plain (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 10:10, 11; 18:13, 14</reflink>), down which the five kings of the Amorites were driven by Joshua in that great battle, the most important in which the Hebrews had been as yet engaged, being their first conflict with their enemies in the open field. Jehovah interposed in behalf of Israel by a terrific hailstorm, which caused more deaths among the Canaanites than did the swords of the Israelites. Beth-horon is mentioned as having been taken by Shishak, B.C. 945, in the list of his conquests, and the pass was the scene of a victory of Judas Maccabeus. (<reflink target="XXX">Comp. Ex. 9:19, 25; Job 38:22, 23; Ps. 18:12-14; Isa. 30:30.</reflink>) The modern name of these places is Beit-ur, distinguished by el-Foka, "the upper," and el-Tahta, "the nether." The lower was at the foot of the pass, and the upper, 500 feet higher, at the top, west of Gibeon. (<see target="x-self">See GIBEON.</see>)</description>

  <item id="Beth-jeshimoth">
    <description>house of wastes, or deserts, a town near Abel-shittim, east of Jordan, in the desert of Moab, where the Israelites encamped not long before crossing the Jordan (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 33:49; A.V., "Bethjesimoth"</reflink>). It was within the territory of Sihon, king of the Amorites (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 12:3</reflink>).</description>

  <item id="Beth-le-Aphrah">
    <description>(<reflink target="XXX">R.V. Micah 1:10</reflink>), house of dust. The Authorized Version reads "in the house of Aphrah." This is probably the name of a town in the Shephelah, or "low country," between Joppa and Gaza.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Beth-peor">
    <description>house of Peor; i.e., "temple of Baal-peor", a place in Moab, on the east of Jordan, opposite Jericho. It was in the tribe of Reuben (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 13:20; Deut. 3:29; 4:46</reflink>). In the "ravine" or valley over against Beth-peor Moses was probably buried (<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 34:6</reflink>).</description>

  <item id="Beth-phage">
    <description>house of the unripe fig, a village on the Mount of Olives, on the road from Jerusalem to Jericho (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 21:1; Mark 11:1; Luke 19:29</reflink>), and very close to Bethany. It was the limit of a Sabbath-day's journey from Jerusalem, i.e., 2,000 cubits. It has been identified with the modern Kefr-et-Tur.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Beth-shean">
    <description>house of security or rest, a city which belonged to Manasseh (<reflink target="XXX">1 Chr. 7:29</reflink>), on the west of Jordan. The bodies of Saul and his sons were fastened to its walls. In Solomon's time it gave its name to a district (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 4:12</reflink>). The name is found in an abridged form, Bethshan, in 1 Sam. 31:10, 12 and 2 Sam. 21:12. It is on the road from Jerusalem to Damascus, about 5 miles from the Jordan, and 14 from the south end of the Lake of Gennesaret. After the Captivity it was called Scythopolis, i.e., "the city of the Scythians," who about B.C. 640 came down from the steppes of Southern Russia and settled in different places in Syria. It is now called Beisan.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Beth-shemesh">
    <description>house of the sun. (1.) A sacerdotal city in the tribe of Dan (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 21:16; 1 Sam. 6:15</reflink>), on the north border of Judah (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 15:10</reflink>). It was the scene of an encounter between Jehoash, king of Israel, and Amaziah, king of Judah, in which the latter was made prisoner (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 14:11, 13</reflink>). It was afterwards taken by the Philistines (<reflink target="XXX">2 Chr. 28:18</reflink>). It is the modern ruined Arabic village 'Ain-shems, on the north-west slopes of the mountains of Judah, 14 miles west of Jerusalem.</description>
    <description>(2.) A city between Dothan and the Jordan, near the southern border of Issachar (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 19:22</reflink>), 7 1/2 miles south of Beth-shean. It is the modern Ain-esh-Shemsiyeh.</description>
    <description>(3.) One of the fenced cities of Naphtali (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 19:38</reflink>), between Mount Tabor and the Jordan. Now Khurbet Shema, 3 miles west of Safed. But perhaps the same as No. 2.</description>
    <description>(4.) An idol sanctuary in Egypt (<reflink target="XXX">Jer. 43:13</reflink>); called by the Greeks Heliopolis, and by the Egyptians On (q.v.), Gen. 41:45.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Beth-tappuah">
    <description>house of apples, a town of Judah, now Tuffuh, 5 miles west of Hebron (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 15:53</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Bethabara">
    <description>house of the ford, a place on the east bank of the Jordan, where John was baptizing (<reflink target="XXX">John 1:28</reflink>). It may be identical with Bethbarah, the ancient ford of Jordan of which the men of Ephraim took possession (<reflink target="XXX">Judg. 7:24</reflink>). The Revised Version reads "Bethany beyond Jordan." It was the great ford, and still bears the name of "the ford," Makhadhet 'Abarah, "the ford of crossing over," about 25 miles from Nazareth. (<see target="x-self">See BETHBARAH.</see>)</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Bethany">
    <description>house of dates. (1.) The Revised Version in John 1:28 has this word instead of Bethabara, on the authority of the oldest manuscripts. It appears to have been the name of a place on the east of Jordan.</description>
    <description>(2.) A village on the south-eastern slope of the Mount of Olives (<reflink target="XXX">Mark 11:1</reflink>), about 2 miles east of Jerusalem, on the road to Jericho. It derived its name from the number of palm-trees which grew there. It was the residence of Lazarus and his sisters. It is frequently mentioned in connection with memorable incidents in the life of our Lord (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 21:17; 26:6; Mark 11:11, 12; 14:3; Luke 24:50; John 11:1; 12:1</reflink>). It is now known by the name of el-Azariyeh, i.e., "place of Lazarus," or simply Lazariyeh. Seen from a distance, the village has been described as "remarkably beautiful, the perfection of retirement and repose, of seclusion and lovely peace." Now a mean village, containing about twenty families.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Bethel">
    <description>house of God. (1.) A place in Central Palestine, about 10 miles north of Jerusalem, at the head of the pass of Michmash and Ai. It was originally the royal Canaanite city of Luz (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 28:19</reflink>). The name Bethel was at first apparently given to the sanctuary in the neighbourhood of Luz, and was not given to the city itself till after its conquest by the tribe of Ephraim. When Abram entered Canaan he formed his second encampment between Bethel and Hai (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 12:8</reflink>); and on his return from Egypt he came back to it, and again "called upon the name of the Lord" (13:4). Here Jacob, on his way from Beersheba to Haran, had a vision of the angels of God ascending and descending on the ladder whose top reached unto heaven (28:10, 19); and on his return he again visited this place, "where God talked with him" (35:1-15), and there he "built an altar, and called the place El-beth-el" (q.v.). To this second occasion of God's speaking with Jacob at Bethel, Hosea (12:4,5) makes reference.</description>
    <description>In troublous times the people went to Bethel to ask counsel of God (<reflink target="XXX">Judg. 20:18, 31; 21:2</reflink>). Here the ark of the covenant was kept for a long time under the care of Phinehas, the grandson of Aaron (20:26-28). Here also Samuel held in rotation his court of justice (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 7:16</reflink>). It was included in Israel after the kingdom was divided, and it became one of the seats of the worship of the golden calf (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 12:28-33; 13:1</reflink>). Hence the prophet Hosea (<reflink target="XXX">Hos. 4:15; 5:8; 10:5, 8</reflink>) calls it in contempt Beth-aven, i.e., "house of idols." Bethel remained an abode of priests even after the kingdom of Israel was desolated by the king of Assyria (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 17:28, 29</reflink>). At length all traces of the idolatries were extirpated by Josiah, king of Judah (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 23:15-18</reflink>); and the place was still in existence after the Captivity (<reflink target="XXX">Ezra 2:28; Neh. 7:32</reflink>). It has been identified with the ruins of Beitin, a small village amid extensive ruins some 9 miles south of Shiloh.</description>
    <description>(2.) Mount Bethel was a hilly district near Bethel (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 16:1; 1 Sam. 13:2</reflink>).</description>

  <item id="Bethesda">
    <description>house of mercy, a reservoir (Gr. kolumbethra, "a swimming bath") with five porches, close to the sheep-gate or market (<reflink target="XXX">Neh. 3:1; John 5:2</reflink>). Eusebius the historian (A.D. 330) calls it "the sheep-pool." It is also called "Bethsaida" and "Beth-zatha" (<reflink target="XXX">John 5:2, R.V. marg.</reflink>). Under these "porches" or colonnades were usually a large number of infirm people waiting for the "troubling of the water." It is usually identified with the modern so-called Fountain of the Virgin, in the valley of the Kidron, and not far from the Pool of Siloam (q.v.); and also with the Birket Israel, a pool near the mouth of the valley which runs into the Kidron south of "St. Stephen's Gate." Others again identify it with the twin pools called the "Souterrains," under the convent of the Sisters of Zion, situated in what must have been the rock-hewn ditch between Bezetha and the fortress of Antonia. But quite recently Schick has discovered a large tank, as sketched here, situated about 100 feet north-west of St. Anne's Church, which is, as he contends, very probably the Pool of Bethesda. No certainty as to its identification, however, has as yet been arrived at. (<see target="x-self">See FOUNTAIN; GIHON.</see>)</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Bethlehem">
    <description>house of bread. (1.) A city in the "hill country" of Judah. It was originally called Ephrath (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 35:16, 19; 48:7; Ruth 4:11</reflink>). It was also called Beth-lehem Ephratah (<reflink target="XXX">Micah 5:2</reflink>), Beth-lehem-judah (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 17:12</reflink>), and "the city of David" (<reflink target="XXX">Luke 2:4</reflink>). It is first noticed in Scripture as the place where Rachel died and was buried "by the wayside," directly to the north of the city (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 48:7</reflink>). The valley to the east was the scene of the story of Ruth the Moabitess. There are the fields in which she gleaned, and the path by which she and Naomi returned to the town. Here was David's birth-place, and here also, in after years, he was anointed as king by Samuel (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 16:4-13</reflink>); and it was from the well of Bethlehem that three of his heroes brought water for him at the risk of their lives when he was in the cave of Adullam (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 23:13-17</reflink>). But it was distinguished above every other city as the birth-place of "Him whose goings forth have been of old" (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 2:6; comp. Micah 5:2</reflink>). Afterwards Herod, "when he saw that he was mocked of the wise men," sent and slew "all the children that were in Bethlehem, and in all the coasts thereof, from two years old and under" (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 2:16, 18; Jer. 31:15</reflink>).</description>
    <description>Bethlehem bears the modern name of Beit-Lahm, i.e., "house of flesh." It is about 5 miles south of Jerusalem, standing at an elevation of about 2,550 feet above the sea, thus 100 feet higher than Jerusalem.</description>
    <description>There is a church still existing, built by Constantine the Great (A.D. 330), called the "Church of the Nativity," over a grotto or cave called the "holy crypt," and said to be the "stable" in which Jesus was born. This is perhaps the oldest existing Christian church in the world. Close to it is another grotto, where Jerome the Latin father is said to have spent thirty years of his life in translating the Scriptures into Latin. (<see target="x-self">See VERSION.</see>)</description>
    <description>(2.) A city of Zebulun, mentioned only in Josh. 19:15. Now Beit-Lahm, a ruined village about 6 miles west-north-west of Nazareth.</description>

  <item id="Bethsaida">
    <description>house of fish. (1.) A town in Galilee, on the west side of the sea of Tiberias, in the "land of Gennesaret." It was the native place of Peter, Andrew, and Philip, and was frequently resorted to by Jesus (<reflink target="XXX">Mark 6:45; John 1:44; 12:21</reflink>). It is supposed to have been at the modern 'Ain Tabighah, a bay to the north of Gennesaret.</description>
    <description>(2.) A city near which Christ fed 5,000 (<reflink target="XXX">Luke 9:10; comp. John 6:17; Matt. 14:15-21</reflink>), and where the blind man had his sight restored (<reflink target="XXX">Mark 8:22</reflink>), on the east side of the lake, two miles up the Jordan. It stood within the region of Gaulonitis, and was enlarged by Philip the tetrarch, who called it "Julias," after the emperor's daughter. Or, as some have supposed, there may have been but one Bethsaida built on both sides of the lake, near where the Jordan enters it. Now the ruins et-Tel.</description>

  <item id="Bethuel">
    <description>man of God, or virgin of God, or house of God. (1.) The son of Nahor by Milcah; nephew of Abraham, and father of Rebekah (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 22:22, 23; 24:15, 24, 47</reflink>). He appears in person only once (24:50).</description>
    <description>(2.) A southern city of Judah (<reflink target="XXX">1 Chr. 4:30</reflink>); called also Bethul (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 19:4</reflink>) and Bethel (12:16; 1 Sam. 30:27).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Bethzur">
    <description>house of rock, a town in the mountains of Judah (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 15:58</reflink>), about 4 miles to the north of Hebron. It was built by Rehoboam for the defence of his kingdom (<reflink target="XXX">2 Chr. 11:7</reflink>). It stood near the modern ed-Dirweh. Its ruins are still seen on a hill which bears the name of Beit-Sur, and which commands the road from Beer-sheba and Hebron to Jerusalem from the south.</description>

  <item id="Betroth">
    <description>to promise "by one's truth." Men and women were betrothed when they were engaged to be married. This usually took place a year or more before marriage.

  <item id="Bezaleel">
    <description>in the shadow of God; i.e., "under his protection", the artificer who executed the work of art in connection with the tabernacle in the wilderness (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 31:2; 35:30</reflink>). He was engaged principally in works of metal, wood, and stone; while Aholiab, who was associated with him and subordinate to him, had the charge of the textile fabrics (36:1, 2; 38:22). He was of the tribe of Judah, the son of Uri, and grandson of Hur (31:2). Mention is made in Ezra 10:30 of another of the same name.</description>

  <item id="Bible">
    <description>Bible, the English form of the Greek name _Biblia_, meaning "books," the name which in the fifth century began to be given to the entire collection of sacred books, the "Library of Divine Revelation." The name Bible was adopted by Wickliffe, and came gradually into use in our English language. The Bible consists of sixty-six different books, composed by many different writers, in three different languages, under different circumstances; writers of almost every social rank, statesmen and peasants, kings, herdsmen, fishermen, priests, tax-gatherers, tentmakers; educated and uneducated, Jews and Gentiles; most of them unknown to each other, and writing at various periods during the space of about 1600 years: and yet, after all, it is only one book dealing with only one subject in its numberless aspects and relations, the subject of man's redemption.</description>
    <description>It is divided into the Old Testament, containing thirty-nine books, and the New Testament, containing twenty-seven books. The names given to the Old in the writings of the New are "the scriptures" (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 21:42</reflink>), "scripture" (<reflink target="XXX">2 Pet. 1:20</reflink>), "the holy scriptures" (<reflink target="XXX">Rom. 1:2</reflink>), "the law" (<reflink target="XXX">John 12:34</reflink>), "the law of Moses, the prophets, and the psalms" (<reflink target="XXX">Luke 24:44</reflink>), "the law and the prophets" (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 5:17</reflink>), "the old covenant" (<reflink target="XXX">2 Cor. 3:14, R.V.</reflink>). There is a break of 400 years between the Old Testament and the New. (<see target="x-self">See APOCRYPHA.</see>)</description>
    <description>The Old Testament is divided into three parts:, 1. The Law (Torah), consisting of the Pentateuch, or five books of Moses. 2. The Prophets, consisting of (1) the former, namely, Joshua, Judges, the Books of Samuel, and the Books of Kings; (2) the latter, namely, the greater prophets, Isaiah, Jeremiah, and Ezekiel, and the twelve minor prophets. 3. The Hagiographa, or holy writings, including the rest of the books. These were ranked in three divisions:, (1) The Psalms, Proverbs, and Job, distinguished by the Hebrew name, a word formed of the initial letters of these books, _emeth_, meaning truth. (2) Canticles, Ruth, Lamentations, Ecclesiastes, and Esther, called the five rolls, as being written for the synagogue use on five separate rolls. (3) Daniel, Ezra, Nehemiah, and 1 and 2 Chronicles. Between the Old and the New Testament no addition was made to the revelation God had already given. The period of New Testament revelation, extending over a century, began with the appearance of John the Baptist.</description>
    <description>The New Testament consists of (1) the historical books, viz., the Gospels, and the Acts of the Apostles; (2) the Epistles; and (3) the book of prophecy, the Revelation.</description>
    <description>The division of the Bible into chapters and verses is altogether of human invention, designed to facilitate reference to it. The ancient Jews divided the Old Testament into certain sections for use in the synagogue service, and then at a later period, in the ninth century A.D., into verses. Our modern system of chapters for all the books of the Bible was introduced by Cardinal Hugo about the middle of the thirteenth century (he died 1263). The system of verses for the New Testament was introduced by Stephens in 1551, and generally adopted, although neither Tyndale's nor Coverdale's English translation of the Bible has verses. The division is not always wisely made, yet it is very useful. (<see target="x-self">See VERSION.</see>)</description>

  <item id="Bigthan">
    <description>one of the eunuchs who "kept the door" in the court of Ahasuerus. With Teresh he conspired against the king's life. Mordecai detected the conspiracy, and the culprits were hanged (<reflink target="XXX">Esther 2:21-23; 6:1-3</reflink>).</description>

  <item id="Bildad">
    <description>son of contention, one of Job's friends. He is called "the Shuhite," probably as belonging to Shuah, a district in Arabia, in which Shuah, the sixth son of Abraham by Keturah, settled (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 25:2</reflink>). He took part in each of the three controversies into which Job's friends entered with him (<reflink target="XXX">Job 8:1; 18:1; 25:1</reflink>), and delivered three speeches, very severe and stern in their tone, although less violent than those of Zophar, but more so than those of Eliphaz.</description>

  <item id="Bilgah">
    <description>cheerful. (1.) The head of the fifteenth sacerdotal course for the temple service (<reflink target="XXX">1 Chr. 24:14</reflink>). (2.) A priest who returned from Babylon with Zerubbabel (<reflink target="XXX">Neh. 12:5, 18</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Bilhah">
    <description>faltering; bashful, Rachel's handmaid, whom she gave to Jacob (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 29:29</reflink>). She was the mother of Dan and Naphtali (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 30:3-8</reflink>). Reuben was cursed by his father for committing adultry with her (35:22; 49:4). He was deprived of the birth-right, which was given to the sons of Joseph.</description>

  <item id="Bilshan">
    <description>son of the tongue; i.e., "eloquent", a man of some note who returned from the Captivity with Zerubbabel (<reflink target="XXX">Ezra 2:2; Neh. 7:7</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Bird">
    <description>Birds are divided in the Mosaic law into two classes, (1) the clean (<reflink target="XXX">Lev. 1:14-17; 5:7-10; 14:4-7</reflink>), which were offered in sacrifice; and (2) the unclean (<reflink target="XXX">Lev. 11:13-20</reflink>). When offered in sacrifice, they were not divided as other victims were (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 15:10</reflink>). They are mentioned also as an article of food (<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 14:11</reflink>). The art of snaring wild birds is referred to (<reflink target="XXX">Ps. 124:7; Prov. 1:17; 7:23; Jer. 5:27</reflink>). Singing birds are mentioned in Ps. 104:12; Eccl. 12:4. Their timidity is alluded to (<reflink target="XXX">Hos. 11:11</reflink>). The reference in Ps. 84:3 to the swallow and the sparrow may be only a comparison equivalent to, "What her house is to the sparrow, and her nest to the swallow, that thine altars are to my soul."</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Birsha">
    <description>son of wickedness, a king of Gomorrah whom Abraham succoured in the invasion of Chedorlaomer (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 14:2</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Birth">
    <description>As soon as a child was born it was washed, and rubbed with salt (<reflink target="XXX">Ezek. 16:4</reflink>), and then swathed with bandages (<reflink target="XXX">Job 38:9; Luke 2:7, 12</reflink>). A Hebrew mother remained forty days in seclusion after the birth of a son, and after the birth of a daughter double that number of days. At the close of that period she entered into the tabernacle or temple and offered up a sacrifice of purification (<reflink target="XXX">Lev. 12:1-8; Luke 2:22</reflink>). A son was circumcised on the eighth day after his birth, being thereby consecrated to God (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 17:10-12; comp. Rom. 4:11</reflink>). Seasons of misfortune are likened to the pains of a woman in travail, and seasons of prosperity to the joy that succeeds child-birth (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 13:8; Jer. 4:31; John 16:21, 22</reflink>). The natural birth is referred to as the emblem of the new birth (<reflink target="XXX">John 3:3-8; Gal. 6:15; Titus 3:5, etc.</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Birth-day">
    <description>The observance of birth-days was common in early times (<reflink target="XXX">Job 1:4, 13, 18</reflink>). They were specially celebrated in the land of Egypt (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 40:20</reflink>). There is no recorded instance in Scripture of the celebration of birth-days among the Jews. On the occasion of Herod's birth-day John the Baptist was beheaded (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 14:6</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Birthright">
    <description>(1.) This word denotes the special privileges and advantages belonging to the first-born son among the Jews. He became the priest of the family. Thus Reuben was the first-born of the patriarchs, and so the priesthood of the tribes belonged to him. That honour was, however, transferred by God from Reuben to Levi (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 3:12, 13; 8:18</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(2.) The first-born son had allotted to him also a double portion of the paternal inheritance (<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 21:15-17</reflink>). Reuben was, because of his undutiful conduct, deprived of his birth-right (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 49:4; 1 Chr. 5:1</reflink>). Esau transferred his birth-right to Jacob (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 25:33</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(3.) The first-born inherited the judicial authority of his father, whatever it might be (<reflink target="XXX">2 Chr. 21:3</reflink>). By divine appointment, however, David excluded Adonijah in favour of Solomon.</description>
    <description>(4.) The Jews attached a sacred importance to the rank of "first-born" and "first-begotten" as applied to the Messiah (<reflink target="XXX">Rom. 8:29; Col. 1:18; Heb. 1:4-6</reflink>). As first-born he has an inheritance superior to his brethren, and is the alone true priest.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Bishop">
    <description>an overseer. In apostolic times, it is quite manifest that there was no difference as to order between bishops and elders or presbyters (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 20:17-28; 1 Pet. 5:1, 2; Phil. 1:1; 1 Tim. 3</reflink>). The term bishop is never once used to denote a different office from that of elder or presbyter. These different names are simply titles of the same office, "bishop" designating the function, namely, that of oversight, and "presbyter" the dignity appertaining to the office. Christ is figuratively called "the bishop [episcopos] of souls" (<reflink target="XXX">1 Pet. 2:25</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Bit">
    <description>the curb put into the mouths of horses to restrain them. The Hebrew word (metheg) so rendered in Ps. 32:9 is elsewhere translated "bridle" (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 19:28; Prov. 26:3; Isa. 37:29</reflink>). Bits were generally made of bronze or iron, but sometimes also of gold or silver. In James 3:3 the Authorized Version translates the Greek word by "bits," but the Revised Version by "bridles."</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Bith-ron">
    <description>the broken or divided place, a district in the Arabah or Jordan valley, on the east of the river (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 2:29</reflink>). It was probably the designation of the region in general, which is broken and intersected by ravines.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Bithynia">
    <description>a province in Asia Minor, to the south of the Euxine and Propontis. Christian congregations were here formed at an early time (<reflink target="XXX">1 Pet. 1:1</reflink>). Paul was prevented by the Spirit from entering this province (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 16:7</reflink>). It is noted in church history as the province ruled over by Pliny as Roman proconsul, who was perplexed as to the course he should take with the numerous Christians brought before his tribunal on account of their profession of Christianity and their conduct, and wrote to Trajan, the emperor, for instructions (A.D. 107).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Bitter">
    <description>Bitterness is symbolical of affliction, misery, and servitude (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 1:14; Ruth 1:20; Jer. 9:15</reflink>). The Chaldeans are called the "bitter and hasty nation" (<reflink target="XXX">Hab. 1:6</reflink>). The "gall of bitterness" expresses a state of great wickedness (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 8:23</reflink>). A "root of bitterness" is a wicked person or a dangerous sin (<reflink target="XXX">Heb. 12:15</reflink>).</description>
    <description>The Passover was to be eaten with "bitter herbs" (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 12:8; Num. 9:11</reflink>). The kind of herbs so designated is not known. Probably they were any bitter herbs obtainable at the place and time when the Passover was celebrated. They represented the severity of the servitude under which the people groaned; and have been regarded also as typical of the sufferings of Christ.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Bittern">
    <description>is found three times in connection with the desolations to come upon Babylon, Idumea, and Nineveh (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 14:23; 34:11; Zeph. 2:14</reflink>). This bird belongs to the class of cranes. Its scientific name is Botaurus stellaris. It is a solitary bird, frequenting marshy ground. The Hebrew word (kippod) thus rendered in the Authorized Version is rendered "porcupine" in the Revised Version. But in the passages noted the kippod is associated with birds, with pools of water, and with solitude and desolation. This favours the idea that not the "porcupine" but the "bittern" is really intended by the word.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Bitumen">
    <description>Gen. 11:3, R.V., margin, rendered in the A.V. "slime"), a mineral pitch. With this the ark was pitched (6:14. See also Ex. 2:3.) (<see target="x-self">See SLIME.</see>)</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Black">
    <description>properly the absence of all colour. In Prov. 7:9 the Hebrew word means, as in the margin of the Revised Version, "the pupil of the eye." It is translated "apple" of the eye in Deut. 32:10; Ps. 17:8; Prov. 7:2. It is a different word which is rendered "black" in Lev. 13:31,37; Cant. 1:5; 5:11; and Zech. 6:2, 6. It is uncertain what the "black marble" of Esther 1:6 was which formed a part of the mosaic pavement.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Blade">
    <description>applied to the glittering point of a spear (<reflink target="XXX">Job 39:23</reflink>) or sword (<reflink target="XXX">Nah. 3:3</reflink>), the blade of a dagger (<reflink target="XXX">Judg. 3:22</reflink>); the "shoulder blade" (<reflink target="XXX">Job 31:22</reflink>); the "blade" of cereals (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 13:26</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Blains">
    <description>occurs only in connection with the sixth plague of Egypt (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 9:9, 10</reflink>). In Deut. 28:27, 35, it is called "the botch of Egypt." It seems to have been the fearful disease of black leprosy, a kind of elephantiasis, producing burning ulcers.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Blasphemy">
    <description>In the sense of speaking evil of God this word is found in Ps. 74:18; Isa. 52:5; Rom. 2:24; Rev. 13:1, 6; 16:9, 11, 21. It denotes also any kind of calumny, or evil-speaking, or abuse (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 21:10; Acts 13:45; 18:6, etc.</reflink>). Our Lord was accused of blasphemy when he claimed to be the Son of God (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 26:65; comp. Matt. 9:3; Mark 2:7</reflink>). They who deny his Messiahship blaspheme Jesus (<reflink target="XXX">Luke 22:65; John 10:36</reflink>).</description>
    <description>Blasphemy against the Holy Ghost (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 12:31, 32; Mark 3:28, 29; Luke 12:10</reflink>) is regarded by some as a continued and obstinate rejection of the gospel, and hence is an unpardonable sin, simply because as long as a sinner remains in unbelief he voluntarily excludes himself from pardon. Others regard the expression as designating the sin of attributing to the power of Satan those miracles which Christ performed, or generally those works which are the result of the Spirit's agency.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Blastus">
    <description>chamberlain to king Herod Agrippa I. (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 12:20</reflink>). Such persons generally had great influence with their masters.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Blemish">
    <description>imperfection or bodily deformity excluding men from the priesthood, and rendering animals unfit to be offered in sacrifice (<reflink target="XXX">Lev. 21:17-23; 22:19-25</reflink>). The Christian church, as justified in Christ, is "without blemish" (<reflink target="XXX">Eph. 5:27</reflink>). Christ offered himself a sacrifice "without blemish," acceptable to God (<reflink target="XXX">1 Pet. 1:19</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Bless">
    <description>(1.) God blesses his people when he bestows on them some gift temporal or spiritual (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 1:22; 24:35; Job 42:12; Ps. 45:2; 104:24, 35</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(2.) We bless God when we thank him for his mercies (<reflink target="XXX">Ps. 103:1, 2; 145:1, 2</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(3.) A man blesses himself when he invokes God's blessing (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 65:16</reflink>), or rejoices in God's goodness to him (<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 29:19; Ps. 49:18</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(4.) One blesses another when he expresses good wishes or offers prayer to God for his welfare (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 24:60; 31:55; 1 Sam. 2:20</reflink>). Sometimes blessings were uttered under divine inspiration, as in the case of Noah, Isaac, Jacob, and Moses (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 9:26, 27; 27:28, 29, 40; 48:15-20; 49:1-28; Deut. 33</reflink>). The priests were divinely authorized to bless the people (<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 10:8; Num. 6:22-27</reflink>). We have many examples of apostolic benediction (<reflink target="XXX">2 Cor. 13:14; Eph. 6:23, 24; 2 Thess. 3:16, 18; Heb. 13:20, 21; 1 Pet. 5:10, 11</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(5.) Among the Jews in their thank-offerings the master of the feast took a cup of wine in his hand, and after having blessed God for it and for other mercies then enjoyed, handed it to his guests, who all partook of it. Ps. 116:13 refers to this custom. It is also alluded to in 1 Cor. 10:16, where the apostle speaks of the "cup of blessing."</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Blind">
    <description>Blind beggars are frequently mentioned (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 9:27; 12:22; 20:30; John 5:3</reflink>). The blind are to be treated with compassion (<reflink target="XXX">Lev. 19:14; Deut. 27:18</reflink>). Blindness was sometimes a punishment for disobedience (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 11:2; Jer. 39:7</reflink>), sometimes the effect of old age (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 27:1; 1 Kings 14:4; 1 Sam. 4:15</reflink>). Conquerors sometimes blinded their captives (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 25:7; 1 Sam. 11:2</reflink>). Blindness denotes ignorance as to spiritual things (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 6:10; 42:18, 19; Matt. 15:14; Eph. 4:18</reflink>). The opening of the eyes of the blind is peculiar to the Messiah (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 29:18</reflink>). Elymas was smitten with blindness at Paul's word (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 13:11</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Blood">
    <description>(1.) As food, prohibited in Gen. 9:4, where the use of animal food is first allowed. Comp. Deut. 12:23; Lev. 3:17; 7:26; 17:10-14. The injunction to abstain from blood is renewed in the decree of the council of Jerusalem (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 15:29</reflink>). It has been held by some, and we think correctly, that this law of prohibition was only ceremonial and temporary; while others regard it as still binding on all. Blood was eaten by the Israelites after the battle of Gilboa (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 14:32-34</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(2.) The blood of sacrifices was caught by the priest in a basin, and then sprinkled seven times on the altar; that of the passover on the doorposts and lintels of the houses (Ex. 12; Lev. 4:5-7; 16:14-19). At the giving of the law (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 24:8</reflink>) the blood of the sacrifices was sprinkled on the people as well as on the altar, and thus the people were consecrated to God, or entered into covenant with him, hence the blood of the covenant (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 26:28; Heb. 9:19, 20; 10:29; 13:20</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(3.) Human blood. The murderer was to be punished (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 9:5</reflink>). The blood of the murdered "crieth for vengeance" (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 4:10</reflink>). The "avenger of blood" was the nearest relative of the murdered, and he was required to avenge his death (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 35:24, 27</reflink>). No satisfaction could be made for the guilt of murder (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 35:31</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(4.) Blood used metaphorically to denote race (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 17:26</reflink>), and as a symbol of slaughter (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 34:3</reflink>). To "wash the feet in blood" means to gain a great victory (<reflink target="XXX">Ps. 58:10</reflink>). Wine, from its red colour, is called "the blood of the grape" (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 49:11</reflink>). Blood and water issued from our Saviour's side when it was pierced by the Roman soldier (<reflink target="XXX">John 19:34</reflink>). This has led pathologists to the conclusion that the proper cause of Christ's death was rupture of the heart. (<reflink target="XXX">Comp. Ps. 69:20.</reflink>)</description>

  <item id="Bloody sweat">
    <description>the sign and token of our Lord's great agony (<reflink target="XXX">Luke 22:44</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Blot">
    <description>a stain or reproach (<reflink target="XXX">Job 31:7; Prov. 9:7</reflink>). To blot out sin is to forgive it (<reflink target="XXX">Ps. 51:1, 9; Isa. 44:22; Acts 3:19</reflink>). Christ's blotting out the handwriting of ordinances was his fulfilling the law in our behalf (<reflink target="XXX">Col. 2:14</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Blue">
    <description>generally associated with purple (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 25:4; 26:1, 31, 36, etc.</reflink>). It is supposed to have been obtained from a shellfish of the Mediterranean, the Helix ianthina of Linnaeus. The robe of the high priest's ephod was to be all of this colour (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 28:31</reflink>), also the loops of the curtains (26:4) and the ribbon of the breastplate (28:28). Blue cloths were also made for various sacred purposes (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 4:6, 7, 9, 11, 12</reflink>). (See COLOUR</description>

  <item id="Boanerges">
    <description>sons of thunder, a surname given by our Lord to James and John (<reflink target="XXX">Mark 3:17</reflink>) on account of their fervid and impetuous temper (<reflink target="XXX">Luke 9:54</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Boar">
    <description>occurs only in Ps. 80:13. The same Hebrew word is elsewhere rendered "swine" (<reflink target="XXX">Lev. 11:7; Deut. 14:8; Prov. 11:22; Isa. 65:4; 66:3, 17</reflink>). The Hebrews abhorred swine's flesh, and accordingly none of these animals were reared, except in the district beyond the Sea of Galilee. In the psalm quoted above the powers that destroyed the Jewish nation are compared to wild boars and wild beasts of the field.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Boaz">
    <description>alacrity. (1.) The husband of Ruth, a wealthy Bethlehemite. By the "levirate law" the duty devolved on him of marrying Ruth the Moabitess (<reflink target="XXX">Ruth 4:1-13</reflink>). He was a kinsman of Mahlon, her first husband.</description>
    <description>(2.) The name given (for what reason is unknown) to one of the two (the other was called Jachin) brazen pillars which Solomon erected in the court of the temple (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 7:21; 2 Chr. 3:17</reflink>). These pillars were broken up and carried to Babylon by Nebuchadnezzar.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Bochim">
    <description>weepers, a place where the angel of the Lord reproved the Israelites for entering into a league with the people of the land. This caused them bitterly to weep, and hence the name of the place (<reflink target="XXX">Judg. 2:1, 5</reflink>). It lay probably at the head of one of the valleys between Gilgal and Shiloh.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Boil">
    <description>(rendered "botch" in Deut. 28:27, 35), an aggravated ulcer, as in the case of Hezekiah (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 20:7; Isa. 38:21</reflink>) or of the Egyptians (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 9:9, 10, 11; Deut. 28:27, 35</reflink>). It designates the disease of Job (2:7), which was probably the black leprosy.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Bolled">
    <description>(<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 9:31</reflink>), meaning "swollen or podded for seed," was adopted in the Authorized Version from the version of Coverdale (1535). The Revised Version has in the margin "was in bloom," which is the more probable rendering of the Hebrew word. It is the fact that in Egypt when barley is in ear (about February) flax is blossoming.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Bolster">
    <description>The Hebrew word _kebir_, rendered "pillow" in 1 Sam. 19:13, 16, but in Revised Version marg. "quilt" or "network," probably means some counterpane or veil intended to protect the head of the sleeper. A different Hebrew word (meraashoth') is used for "bolster" (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 26:7, 11, 16</reflink>). It is rightly rendered in Revised Version "at his head." In Gen. 28:11, 18 the Authorized Version renders it "for his pillows," and the Revised Version "under his head." In Ezek. 13:18, 20 another Hebrew word (kesathoth) is used, properly denoting "cushions" or "pillows," as so rendered both in the Authorized and the Revised Version.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Bond">
    <description>an obligation of any kind (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 30:2, 4, 12</reflink>). The word means also oppression or affliction (<reflink target="XXX">Ps. 116:16; Phil. 1:7</reflink>). Christian love is the "bond of perfectness" (<reflink target="XXX">Col. 3:14</reflink>), and the influences of the Spirit are the "bond of peace" (<reflink target="XXX">Eph. 4:3</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Bondage">
    <description>of Israel in Egypt (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 2:23, 25; 5</reflink>), which is called the "house of bondage" (13:3; 20:2). This word is used also with reference to the captivity in Babylon (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 14:3</reflink>), and the oppression of the Persian king (<reflink target="XXX">Ezra 9:8, 9</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Bonnet">
    <description>(Heb. peer), Ex. 39:28 (R.V., "head-tires"); Ezek. 44:18 (R.V., "tires"), denotes properly a turban worn by priests, and in Isa. 3:20 (R.V., "head-tires") a head-dress or tiara worn by females. The Hebrew word so rendered literally means an ornament, as in Isa. 61:10 (R.V., "garland"), and in Ezek. 24:17, 23 "tire" (R.V., "head-tire"). It consisted of a piece of cloth twisted about the head. In Ex. 28:40; 29:9 it is the translation of a different Hebrew word (migba'ah), which denotes the turban (R.V., "head-tire") of the common priest as distinguished from the mitre of the high priest. (<see target="x-self">See MITRE.</see>)</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Book">
    <description>This word has a comprehensive meaning in Scripture. In the Old Testament it is the rendering of the Hebrew word _sepher_, which properly means a "writing," and then a "volume" (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 17:14; Deut. 28:58; 29:20; Job 19:23</reflink>) or "roll of a book" (<reflink target="XXX">Jer. 36:2, 4</reflink>).</description>
    <description>Books were originally written on skins, on linen or cotton cloth, and on Egyptian papyrus, whence our word "paper." The leaves of the book were generally written in columns, designated by a Hebrew word properly meaning "doors" and "valves" (<reflink target="XXX">Jer. 36:23, R.V., marg. "columns"</reflink>).</description>
    <description>Among the Hebrews books were generally rolled up like our maps, or if very long they were rolled from both ends, forming two rolls (<reflink target="XXX">Luke 4:17-20</reflink>). Thus they were arranged when the writing was on flexible materials; but if the writing was on tablets of wood or brass or lead, then the several tablets were bound together by rings through which a rod was passed.</description>
    <description>A sealed book is one whose contents are secret (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 29:11; Rev. 5:1-3</reflink>). To "eat" a book (<reflink target="XXX">Jer. 15:16; Ezek. 2:8-10; 3:1-3; Rev. 10:9</reflink>) is to study its contents carefully.</description>
    <description>The book of judgment (<reflink target="XXX">Dan. 7:10</reflink>) refers to the method of human courts of justice as illustrating the proceedings which will take place at the day of God's final judgment.</description>
    <description>The book of the wars of the Lord (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 21:14</reflink>), the book of Jasher (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 10:13</reflink>), and the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah and Israel (<reflink target="XXX">2 Chr. 25:26</reflink>), were probably ancient documents known to the Hebrews, but not forming a part of the canon.</description>
    <description>The book of life (<reflink target="XXX">Ps. 69:28</reflink>) suggests the idea that as the redeemed form a community or citizenship (<reflink target="XXX">Phil. 3:20; 4:3</reflink>), a catalogue of the citizens' names is preserved (<reflink target="XXX">Luke 10:20; Rev. 20:15</reflink>). Their names are registered in heaven (<reflink target="XXX">Luke 10:20; Rev. 3:5</reflink>).</description>
    <description>The book of the covenant (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 24:7</reflink>), containing Ex. 20:22-23:33, is the first book actually mentioned as a part of the written word. It contains a series of laws, civil, social, and religious, given to Moses at Sinai immediately after the delivery of the decalogue. These were written in this "book."</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Booth">
    <description>a hut made of the branches of a tree. In such tabernacles Jacob sojourned for a season at a place named from this circumstance Succoth (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 33:17</reflink>). Booths were erected also at the feast of Tabernacles (q.v.), Lev. 23:42, 43, which commemorated the abode of the Israelites in the wilderness.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Booty">
    <description>captives or cattle or objects of value taken in war. In Canaan all that breathed were to be destroyed (<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 20: 16</reflink>). The "pictures and images" of the Canaanites were to be destroyed also (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 33:52</reflink>). The law of booty as to its division is laid down in Num. 31:26-47. David afterwards introduced a regulation that the baggage-guard should share the booty equally with the soldiers engaged in battle. He also devoted of the spoils of war for the temple (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 30:24-26; 2 Sam. 8:11; 1 Chr. 26:27</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Borrow">
    <description>The Israelites "borrowed" from the Egyptians (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 12:35, R.V., "asked"</reflink>) in accordance with a divine command (3:22; 11:2). But the word (sha'al) so rendered here means simply and always to "request" or "demand." The Hebrew had another word which is properly translated "borrow" in Deut. 28:12; Ps. 37:21. It was well known that the parting was final. The Egyptians were so anxious to get the Israelites away out of their land that "they let them have what they asked" (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 12:36, R.V.</reflink>), or literally "made them to ask," urged them to take whatever they desired and depart. (<see target="x-self">See LOAN.</see>)</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Bosom">
    <description>In the East objects are carried in the bosom which Europeans carry in the pocket. To have in one's bosom indicates kindness, secrecy, or intimacy (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 16:5; 2 Sam. 12:8</reflink>). Christ is said to have been in "the bosom of the Father," i.e., he had the most perfect knowledge of the Father, had the closest intimacy with him (<reflink target="XXX">John 1:18</reflink>). John (13:23) was "leaning on Jesus' bosom" at the last supper. Our Lord carries his lambs in his bosom, i.e., has a tender, watchful care over them (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 40:11</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Bosor">
    <description>the Chaldee or Aramaic form of the name Beor, the father of Balaam (<reflink target="XXX">2 Pet. 2:15</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Bosses">
    <description>the projecting parts of a shield (<reflink target="XXX">Job 15:26</reflink>). The Hebrew word thus rendered means anything convex or arched, and hence the back, as of animals.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Botch">
    <description>the name given in Deut. 28:27, 35 to one of the Egyptian plagues (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 9:9</reflink>). The word so translated is usually rendered "boil" (q.v.).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Bottle">
    <description>a vessel made of skins for holding wine (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 9:4. 13; 1 Sam. 16:20; Matt. 9:17; Mark 2:22; Luke 5:37, 38</reflink>), or milk (<reflink target="XXX">Judg. 4:19</reflink>), or water (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 21:14, 15, 19</reflink>), or strong drink (<reflink target="XXX">Hab. 2:15</reflink>).</description>
    <description>Earthenware vessels were also similarly used (<reflink target="XXX">Jer. 19:1-10; 1 Kings 14:3; Isa. 30:14</reflink>). In Job 32:19 (<reflink target="XXX">comp. Matt. 9:17; Luke 5:37, 38; Mark 2:22</reflink>) the reference is to a wine-skin ready to burst through the fermentation of the wine. "Bottles of wine" in the Authorized Version of Hos. 7:5 is properly rendered in the Revised Version by "the heat of wine," i.e., the fever of wine, its intoxicating strength.</description>
    <description>The clouds are figuratively called the "bottles of heaven" (<reflink target="XXX">Job 38:37</reflink>). A bottle blackened or shrivelled by smoke is referred to in Ps. 119:83 as an image to which the psalmist likens himself.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Bow">
    <description>The bow was in use in early times both in war and in the chase (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 21:20; 27:3; 48:22</reflink>). The tribe of Benjamin were famous for the use of the bow (<reflink target="XXX">1 Chr. 8:40; 12:2; 2 Chr. 14:8; 17:17</reflink>); so also were the Elamites (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 22:6</reflink>) and the Lydians (<reflink target="XXX">Jer. 46:9</reflink>). The Hebrew word commonly used for bow means properly to tread (<reflink target="XXX">1 Chr. 5:18; 8:40</reflink>), and hence it is concluded that the foot was employed in bending the bow. Bows of steel (correctly "copper") are mentioned (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 22:35; Ps. 18:34</reflink>).</description>
    <description>The arrows were carried in a quiver (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 27:3; Isa. 22:6; 49:2; Ps. 127:5</reflink>). They were apparently sometimes shot with some burning material attached to them (<reflink target="XXX">Ps. 120:4</reflink>).</description>
    <description>The bow is a symbol of victory (<reflink target="XXX">Ps. 7:12</reflink>). It denotes also falsehood, deceit (<reflink target="XXX">Ps. 64:3, 4; Hos. 7:16; Jer. 9:3</reflink>).</description>
    <description>"The use of the bow" in 2 Sam. 1:18 (A.V.) ought to be "the song of the bow," as in the Revised Version.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Bowels">
    <description>(<reflink target="XXX">Phil. 1:8; 2:1; Col. 3:12</reflink>), compassionate feelings; R.V., "tender mercies."</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Bowing">
    <description>a mode of showing respect. Abraham "bowed himself to the people of the land" (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 23:7</reflink>); so Jacob to Esau (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 33:3</reflink>); and the brethren of Joseph before him as the governor of the land (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 43:28</reflink>). Bowing is also frequently mentioned as an act of adoration to idols (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 23:7; 2 Kings 5:18; Judg. 2:19; Isa. 44:15</reflink>), and to God (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 5:14; Ps. 22:29; 72:9; Micah 6:6; Ps. 95:6; Eph. 3:14</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Bowl">
    <description>The sockets of the lamps of the golden candlestick of the tabernacle are called bowls (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 25:31, 33, 34; 37:17, 19, 20</reflink>); the same word so rendered being elsewhere rendered "cup" (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 44:2, 12, 16</reflink>), and wine "pot" (<reflink target="XXX">Jer. 35:5</reflink>). The reservoir for oil, from which pipes led to each lamp in Zechariah's vision of the candlestick, is called also by this name (<reflink target="XXX">Zech. 4:2, 3</reflink>); so also are the vessels used for libations (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 25:29; 37:16</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Box">
    <description>for holding oil or perfumery (<reflink target="XXX">Mark 14:3</reflink>). It was of the form of a flask or bottle. The Hebrew word (pak) used for it is more appropriately rendered "vial" in 1 Sam. 10:1, and should also be so rendered in 2 Kings 9:1, where alone else it occurs.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Box-tree">
    <description>(Heb. teashshur), mentioned in Isa. 60:13; 41:19, was, according to some, a species of cedar growing in Lebanon. The words of Ezek. 27:6 literally translated are, "Thy benches they have made of ivory, the daughter of the ashur tree," i.e., inlaid with ashur wood. The ashur is the box-tree, and accordingly the Revised Version rightly reads "inlaid in box wood." This is the Buxus sempervirens of botanists. It is remarkable for the beauty of its evergreen foliage and for the utility of its hard and durable wood.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Bozrah">
    <description>enclosure; fortress. (1.) The city of Jobab, one of the early Edomite kings (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 36:33</reflink>). This place is mentioned by the prophets in later times (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 34:6; Jer. 49:13; Amos 1:12; Micah 2:12</reflink>). Its modern representative is el-Busseireh. It lies in the mountain district of Petra, 20 miles to the south-east of the Dead Sea.</description>
    <description>(2.) A Moabite city in the "plain country" (<reflink target="XXX">Jer. 48:24</reflink>), i.e., on the high level down on the east of the Dead Sea. It is probably the modern Buzrah.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Bracelet">
    <description>(1.) Anklets (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 31:50; 2 Sam. 1:10</reflink>), and with reference to men.</description>
    <description>(2.) The rendering of a Hebrew word meaning fasteners, found in Gen. 24:22, 30, 47.</description>
    <description>(3.) In Isa. 3:19, the rendering of a Hebrew word meaning chains, i.e., twisted or chain-like bracelets.</description>
    <description>(4.) In Ex. 35:22 it designates properly a clasp for fastening the dress of females. Some interpret it as a nose-ring.</description>
    <description>(5.) In Gen. 38:18, 25, the rendering of a Hebrew word meaning "thread," and may denote the ornamental cord with which the signet was suspended from the neck of the wearer.</description>
    <description>Bracelets were worn by men as well as by women (<reflink target="XXX">Cant. 5:14, R.V.</reflink>). They were of many various forms. The weight of those presented by Eliezer to Rebekah was ten shekels (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 24:22</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Bramble">
    <description>(1.) Hebrew _atad_, Judg. 9:14; rendered "thorn," Ps. 58:9. The LXX. and Vulgate render by rhamnus, a thorny shrub common in Palestine, resembling the hawthorn.</description>
    <description>(2.) Hebrew _hoah_, Isa. 34:13 (R.V. "thistles"); "thickets" in 1 Sam. 13:6; "thistles" in 2 Kings 14:9, 2 Chr. 25:18, Job 31:40; "thorns" in 2 Chr. 33:11, Cant. 2:2, Hos. 9:6. The word may be regarded as denoting the common thistle, of which there are many species which encumber the corn-fields of Palestine. (<see target="x-self">See THORNS.</see>)</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Branch">
    <description>a symbol of kings descended from royal ancestors (<reflink target="XXX">Ezek. 17:3, 10; Dan. 11:7</reflink>); of prosperity (<reflink target="XXX">Job 8:16</reflink>); of the Messiah, a branch out of the root of the stem of Jesse (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 11:1</reflink>), the "beautiful branch" (4:2), a "righteous branch" (<reflink target="XXX">Jer. 23:5</reflink>), "the Branch" (<reflink target="XXX">Zech. 3:8; 6:12</reflink>).</description>
    <description>Disciples are branches of the true vine (<reflink target="XXX">John 15:5, 6</reflink>). "The branch of the terrible ones" (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 25:5</reflink>) is rightly translated in the Revised Version "the song of the terrible ones," i.e., the song of victory shall be brought low by the destruction of Babylon and the return of the Jews from captivity.</description>
    <description>The "abominable branch" is a tree on which a malefactor has been hanged (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 14:19</reflink>). The "highest branch" in Ezek. 17:3 represents Jehoiakim the king.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Brass">
    <description>which is an alloy of copper and zinc, was not known till the thirteenth century. What is designated by this word in Scripture is properly copper (<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 8:9</reflink>). It was used for fetters (<reflink target="XXX">Judg. 16:21; 2 Kings 25:7</reflink>), for pieces of armour (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 17:5, 6</reflink>), for musical instruments (<reflink target="XXX">1 Chr. 15:19; 1 Cor. 13:1</reflink>), and for money (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 10:9</reflink>).</description>
    <description>It is a symbol of insensibility and obstinacy in sin (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 48:4; Jer. 6:28; Ezek. 22:18</reflink>), and of strength (<reflink target="XXX">Ps. 107:16; Micah 4:13</reflink>).</description>
    <description>The Macedonian empire is described as a kingdom of brass (<reflink target="XXX">Dan. 2:39</reflink>). The "mountains of brass" Zechariah (6:1) speaks of have been supposed to represent the immutable decrees of God.</description>
    <description>The serpent of brass was made by Moses at the command of God (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 21:4-9</reflink>), and elevated on a pole, so that it might be seen by all the people when wounded by the bite of the serpents that were sent to them as a punishment for their murmurings against God and against Moses. It was afterwards carried by the Jews into Canaan, and preserved by them till the time of Hezekiah, who caused it to be at length destroyed because it began to be viewed by the people with superstitious reverence (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 18:4</reflink>). (<see target="x-self">See NEHUSHTAN.</see>)</description>
    <description>The brazen serpent is alluded to by our Lord in John 3:14, 15. (<see target="x-self">See SERPENT.</see>)</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Bravery">
    <description>(<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 3:18</reflink>), an old English word meaning comeliness or beauty.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Breach">
    <description>an opening in a wall (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 11:27; 2 Kings 12:5</reflink>); the fracture of a limb (<reflink target="XXX">Lev. 24:20</reflink>), and hence the expression, "Heal, etc." (<reflink target="XXX">Ps. 60:2</reflink>). Judg. 5:17, a bay or harbour; R.V., "by his creeks."</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Bread">
    <description>among the Jews was generally made of wheat (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 29:2; Judg. 6:19</reflink>), though also sometimes of other grains (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 14:18; Judg. 7:13</reflink>). Parched grain was sometimes used for food without any other preparation (<reflink target="XXX">Ruth 2:14</reflink>).</description>
    <description>Bread was prepared by kneading in wooden bowls or "kneading troughs" (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 18:6; Ex. 12:34; Jer. 7:18</reflink>). The dough was mixed with leaven and made into thin cakes, round or oval, and then baked. The bread eaten at the Passover was always unleavened (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 12:15-20; Deut. 16:3</reflink>). In the towns there were public ovens, which were much made use of for baking bread; there were also bakers by trade (<reflink target="XXX">Hos. 7:4; Jer. 37:21</reflink>). Their ovens were not unlike those of modern times. But sometimes the bread was baked by being placed on the ground that had been heated by a fire, and by covering it with the embers (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 19:6</reflink>). This was probably the mode in which Sarah prepared bread on the occasion referred to in Gen. 18:6.</description>
    <description>In Lev. 2 there is an account of the different kinds of bread and cakes used by the Jews. (<see target="x-self">See BAKE.</see>)</description>
    <description>The shew-bread (q.v.) consisted of twelve loaves of unleavened bread prepared and presented hot on the golden table every Sabbath. They were square or oblong, and represented the twelve tribes of Israel. The old loaves were removed every Sabbath, and were to be eaten only by the priests in the court of the sanctuary (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 25:30; Lev. 24:8; 1 Sam. 21:1-6; Matt. 12:4</reflink>).</description>
    <description>The word bread is used figuratively in such expressions as "bread of sorrows" (<reflink target="XXX">Ps. 127:2</reflink>), "bread of tears" (80:5), i.e., sorrow and tears are like one's daily bread, they form so great a part in life. The bread of "wickedness" (<reflink target="XXX">Prov. 4:17</reflink>) and "of deceit" (20:17) denote in like manner that wickedness and deceit are a part of the daily life.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Breastplate">
    <description>(1.) That piece of ancient armour that protected the breast. This word is used figuratively in Eph. 6:14 and Isa. 59:17. (<see target="x-self">See ARMOUR.</see>)</description>
    <description>(2.) An ornament covering the breast of the high priest, first mentioned in Ex. 25:7. It was made of embroidered cloth, set with four rows of precious stones, three in each row. On each stone was engraved the name of one of the twelve tribes (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 28:15-29; 39:8-21</reflink>). It was in size about ten inches square. The two upper corners were fastened to the ephod by blue ribbons. It was not to be "loosed from the ephod" (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 28:28</reflink>). The lower corners were fastened to the girdle of the priest. As it reminded the priest of his representative character, it was called the memorial (28:29). It was also called the breastplate of judgment (28:15). (<see target="x-self">See PRIEST.</see>)</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Breeches">
    <description>(<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 28:42</reflink>), rather linen drawers, reaching from the waist to a little above the knee, worn by the priests (<reflink target="XXX">Ezek. 44:17, 18</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Bribe">
    <description>None to be taken; "for the gift maketh open eyes blind, and perverteth the cause of the righteous" (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 23:8, literally rendered</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Bricks">
    <description>the making of, formed the chief labour of the Israelites in Egypt (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 1:13, 14</reflink>). Those found among the ruins of Babylon and Nineveh are about a foot square and four inches thick. They were usually dried in the sun, though also sometimes in kilns (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 12:31; Jer. 43:9; Nah. 3:14</reflink>). (<see target="x-self">See NEBUCHADNEZZAR.</see>)</description>
    <description>The bricks used in the tower of Babel were burnt bricks, cemented in the building by bitumen (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 11:3</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Bride">
    <description>frequently used in the ordinary sense (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 49:18; 61:10, etc.</reflink>). The relation between Christ and his church is set forth under the figure of that between a bridegroom and bride (<reflink target="XXX">John 3:29</reflink>). The church is called "the bride" (<reflink target="XXX">Rev. 21:9; 22:17</reflink>). Compare parable of the Ten Virgins (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 25:1-13</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Bridle">
    <description>Three Hebrew words are thus rendered in the Authorized Version. (1.) Heb. _mahsom'_ signifies a muzzle or halter or bridle, by which the rider governs his horse (<reflink target="XXX">Ps.39:1</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(2.) _Me'theg_, rendered also "bit" in Ps. 32:9, which is its proper meaning. Found in 2 Kings 19:28, where the restraints of God's providence are metaphorically styled his "bridle" and "hook." God's placing a "bridle in the jaws of the people" (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 30:28; 37:29</reflink>) signifies his preventing the Assyrians from carrying out their purpose against Jerusalem.</description>
    <description>(3.) Another word, _re'sen_, was employed to represent a halter or bridle-rein, as used Ps. 32:9; Isa. 30:28. In Job 30:11 the restraints of law and humanity are called a bridle.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Brier">
    <description>This word occurs frequently, and is the translation of several different terms. (1.) Micah 7:4, it denotes a species of thorn shrub used for hedges. In Prov. 15:19 the word is rendered "thorn" (Heb. _hedek_, "stinging"), supposed by some to be what is called the "apple of Sodom" (q.v.).</description>
    <description>(2.) Ezek. 28:24, _sallon'_, properly a "prickle," such as is found on the shoots of the palm tree.</description>
    <description>(3.) Isa. 55:13, probably simply a thorny bush. Some, following the Vulgate Version, regard it as the "nettle."</description>
    <description>(4.) Isa. 5:6; 7:23-25, etc., frequently used to denote thorny shrubs in general. In 10:17; 27:4, it means troublesome men.</description>
    <description>(5.) In Heb. 6:8 the Greek word (tribolos) so rendered means "three-pronged," and denotes the land caltrop, a low throny shrub resembling in its spikes the military "crow-foot." Comp. Matt. 7:16, "thistle."</description>

  <item id="Brigandine">
    <description>(<reflink target="XXX">Jer. 46:4; 51:3</reflink>), an obsolete English word denoting a scale coat of armour, or habergeon, worn by light-armed "brigands." The Revised Version has "coat of mail."</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Brimstone">
    <description>an inflammable mineral substance found in quantities on the shores of the Dead Sea. The cities of the plain were destroyed by a rain of fire and brimstone (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 19:24, 25</reflink>). In Isa. 34:9 allusion is made to the destruction of these cities. This word figuratively denotes destruction or punishment (<reflink target="XXX">Job 18:15; Isa. 30:33; 34:9; Ps. 11:6; Ezek. 38:22</reflink>). It is used to express the idea of excruciating torment in Rev. 14:10; 19:20; 20:10.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Brook">
    <description>a torrent. (1.) Applied to small streams, as the Arnon, Jabbok, etc. Isaiah (15:7) speaks of the "book of the willows," probably the Wady-el-Asha. (2.) It is also applied to winter torrents (<reflink target="XXX">Job 6:15; Num. 34:5; Josh. 15:4, 47</reflink>), and to the torrent-bed or wady as well as to the torrent itself (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 13:23; 1 Kings 17:3</reflink>). (3.) In Isa. 19:7 the river Nile is meant, as rendered in the Revised Version.</description>

    <description>(6.) A colleague in office (<reflink target="XXX">Ezra 3:2; 1 Cor. 1:1; 2 Cor. 1:1</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(7.) A fellow-man (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 9:5; 19:7; Matt. 5:22, 23, 24; 7:5; Heb. 2:17</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(8.) One beloved or closely united with another in affection (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 1:26; Acts 6:3; 1 Thess. 5:1</reflink>). Brethren of Jesus (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 1:25; 12:46, 50: Mark 3:31, 32; Gal. 1:19; 1 Cor. 9:5, etc.</reflink>) were probably the younger children of Joseph and Mary. Some have supposed that they may have been the children of Joseph by a former marriage, and others that they were the children of Mary, the Virgin's sister, and wife of Cleophas. The first interpretation, however, is the most natural.</description>

    <description>The leather of shields required oiling (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 1:21; Isa. 21:5</reflink>), so as to prevent its being injured by moisture. Copper (= "brass") shields were also in use (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 17:6; 1 Kings 14:27</reflink>). Those spoken of in 1 Kings 10:16, etc.; 14:26, were probably of massive metal.</description>
    <description>The shields David had taken from his enemies were suspended in the temple as mementoes (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 11:10</reflink>). (<see target="x-self">See ARMOUR, SHIELD.</see>)</description>

  <item id="Building">
    <description>among the Jews was suited to the climate and conditions of the country. They probably adopted the kind of architecture for their dwellings which they found already existing when they entered Canaan (<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 6:10; Num. 13:19</reflink>). Phoenician artists (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 5:11; 1 Kings 5:6, 18</reflink>) assisted at the erection of the royal palace and the temple at Jerusalem. Foreigners also assisted at the restoration of the temple after the Exile (<reflink target="XXX">Ezra 3:7</reflink>).</description>
    <description>In Gen. 11:3, 9, we have the first recorded instance of the erection of buildings. The cities of the plain of Shinar were founded by the descendants of Shem (10:11, 12, 22).</description>
    <description>The Israelites were by occupation shepherds and dwellers in tents (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 47:3</reflink>); but from the time of their entering Canaan they became dwellers in towns, and in houses built of the native limestone of Palestine. Much building was carried on in Solomon's time. Besides the buildings he completed at Jerusalem, he also built Baalath and Tadmor (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 9:15, 24</reflink>). Many of the kings of Israel and Judah were engaged in erecting various buildings.</description>
    <description>Herod and his sons and successors restored the temple, and built fortifications and other structures of great magnificence in Jerusalem (<reflink target="XXX">Luke 21:5</reflink>).</description>
    <description>The instruments used in building are mentioned as the plumb-line (<reflink target="XXX">Amos 7:7</reflink>), the measuring-reed (<reflink target="XXX">Ezek. 40:3</reflink>), and the saw (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 7:9</reflink>).</description>
    <description>Believers are "God's building" (<reflink target="XXX">1 Cor. 3:9</reflink>); and heaven is called "a building of God" (<reflink target="XXX">2 Cor. 5:1</reflink>). Christ is the only foundation of his church (<reflink target="XXX">1 Cor. 3:10-12</reflink>), of which he also is the builder (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 16:18</reflink>).</description>

  <item id="Bullock">
    <description>(1.) The translation of a word which is a generic name for horned cattle (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 65:25</reflink>). It is also rendered "cow" (<reflink target="XXX">Ezek. 4:15</reflink>), "ox" (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 12:16</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(2.) The translation of a word always meaning an animal of the ox kind, without distinction of age or sex (<reflink target="XXX">Hos. 12:11</reflink>). It is rendered "cow" (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 18:17</reflink>) and "ox" (<reflink target="XXX">Lev. 17:3</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(3.) Another word is rendered in the same way (<reflink target="XXX">Jer. 31:18</reflink>). It is also translated "calf" (<reflink target="XXX">Lev. 9:3; Micah 6:6</reflink>). It is the same word used of the "molten calf" (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 32:4, 8</reflink>) and "the golden calf" (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 12:28</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(4.) In Judg. 6:25; Isa. 34:7, the Hebrew word is different. It is the customary word for bulls offered in sacrifice. In Hos. 14:2, the Authorized Version has "calves," the Revised Version "bullocks."</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Bulrush">
    <description>(1.) In Isa. 58:5 the rendering of a word which denotes "belonging to a marsh," from the nature of the soil in which it grows (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 18:2</reflink>). It was sometimes platted into ropes (<reflink target="XXX">Job. 41:2; A.V., "hook," R.V., "rope," lit. "cord of rushes"</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(2.) In Ex. 2:3, Isa. 18:2 (R.V., "papyrus") this word is the translation of the Hebrew _gome_, which designates the plant as absorbing moisture. In Isa. 35:7 and Job 8:11 it is rendered "rush." This was the Egyptian papyrus (papyrus Nilotica). It was anciently very abundant in Egypt. The Egyptians made garments and shoes and various utensils of it. It was used for the construction of the ark of Moses (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 2:3, 5</reflink>). The root portions of the stem were used for food. The inside bark was cut into strips, which were sewed together and dried in the sun, forming the papyrus used for writing. It is no longer found in Egypt, but grows luxuriantly in Palestine, in the marshes of the Huleh, and in the swamps at the north end of the Lake of Gennesaret.

  </item>
  <item id="Burial">
    <description>The first burial we have an account of is that of Sarah (Gen. 23). The first commercial transaction recorded is that of the purchase of a burial-place, for which Abraham weighed to Ephron "four hundred shekels of silver current money with the merchants." Thus the patriarch became the owner of a part of the land of Canaan, the only part he ever possessed. When he himself died, "his sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of Machpelah," beside Sarah his wife (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 25:9</reflink>).</description>
    <description>Deborah, Rebekah's nurse, was buried under Allon-bachuth, "the oak of weeping" (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 35:8</reflink>), near to Bethel. Rachel died, and was buried near Ephrath; "and Jacob set a pillar upon her grave" (16-20). Isaac was buried at Hebron, where he had died (27, 29). Jacob, when charging his sons to bury him in the cave of Machpelah, said, "There they buried Abraham and Sarah his wife; there they buried Isaac and Rebekah his wife; and there I buried Leah" (49:31). In compliance with the oath which he made him swear unto him (47:29-31), Joseph, assisted by his brethren, buried Jacob in the cave of Machpelah (50:2, 13). At the Exodus, Moses "took the bones of Joseph with him," and they were buried in the "parcel of ground" which Jacob had bought of the sons of Hamor (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 24:32</reflink>), which became Joseph's inheritance (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 48:22; 1 Chr. 5:1; John 4:5</reflink>). Two burials are mentioned as having taken place in the wilderness. That of Miriam (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 20:1</reflink>), and that of Moses, "in the land of Moab" (<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 34:5, 6, 8</reflink>). There is no account of the actual burial of Aaron, which probably, however, took place on the summit of Mount Hor (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 20:28, 29</reflink>).</description>
    <description>Joshua was buried "in the border of his inheritance in Timnath-serah" (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 24: 30</reflink>).</description>
    <description>In Job we find a reference to burying-places, which were probably the Pyramids (3:14, 15). The Hebrew word for "waste places" here resembles in sound the Egyptian word for "pyramids."</description>
    <description>Samuel, like Moses, was honoured with a national burial (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 25:1</reflink>). Joab (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 2:34</reflink>) "was buried in his own house in the wilderness."</description>
    <description>In connection with the burial of Saul and his three sons we meet for the first time with the practice of burning the dead (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 31:11-13</reflink>). The same practice is again referred to by Amos (6:10).</description>
    <description>Absalom was buried "in the wood" where he was slain (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 18:17, 18</reflink>). The raising of the heap of stones over his grave was intended to mark abhorrence of the person buried (<reflink target="XXX">comp. Josh. 7:26 and 8:29</reflink>). There was no fixed royal burying-place for the Hebrew kings. We find several royal burials taking place, however, "in the city of David" (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 2:10; 11:43; 15:8; 2 Kings 14:19, 20; 15:38; 1 Kings 14:31; 22:50; 2 Chr. 21:19, 20; 2 Chr. 24:25, etc.</reflink>). Hezekiah was buried in the mount of the sepulchres of the sons of David; "and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem did him honour at his death" (<reflink target="XXX">2 Chr. 32:33</reflink>).</description>
    <description>Little is said regarding the burial of the kings of Israel. Some of them were buried in Samaria, the capital of their kingdom (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 10:35; 13:9; 14:16</reflink>).</description>
    <description>Our Lord was buried in a new tomb, hewn out of the rock, which Joseph of Arimathea had prepared for himself (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 27:57-60; Mark 15:46; John 19:41, 42</reflink>).</description>
    <description>The grave of Lazarus was "a cave, and a stone lay on it" (<reflink target="XXX">John 11:38</reflink>). Graves were frequently either natural caverns or artificial excavations formed in the sides of rocks (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 23:9; Matt. 27:60</reflink>); and coffins were seldom used, unless when the body was brought from a distance.</description>

  <item id="Burnt offering">
    <description>Hebrew _olah_; i.e., "ascending," the whole being consumed by fire, and regarded as ascending to God while being consumed. Part of every offering was burnt in the sacred fire, but this was wholly burnt, a "whole burnt offering." It was the most frequent form of sacrifice, and apparently the only one mentioned in the book of Genesis. Such were the sacrifices offered by Abel (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 4:3, 4, here called _minhah_; i.e., "a gift"</reflink>), Noah (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 8:20</reflink>), Abraham (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 22:2, 7, 8, 13</reflink>), and by the Hebrews in Egypt (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 10:25</reflink>).</description>
    <description>The law of Moses afterwards prescribed the occasions and the manner in which burnt sacrifices were to be offered. There were "the continual burnt offering" (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 29:38-42; Lev. 6:9-13</reflink>), "the burnt offering of every sabbath," which was double the daily one (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 28:9, 10</reflink>), "the burnt offering of every month" (28:11-15), the offerings at the Passover (19-23), at Pentecost (<reflink target="XXX">Lev. 23:16</reflink>), the feast of Trumpets (23:23-25), and on the day of Atonement (Lev. 16).</description>
    <description>On other occasions special sacrifices were offered, as at the consecration of Aaron (Ex. 29) and the dedication of the temple (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 8:5, 62-64</reflink>).</description>
    <description>Free-will burnt offerings were also permitted (<reflink target="XXX">Lev. 1:13</reflink>), and were offered at the accession of Solomon to the throne (<reflink target="XXX">1 Chr. 29:21</reflink>), and at the reformation brought about by Hezekiah (<reflink target="XXX">2 Chr. 29: 31-35</reflink>).</description>
    <description>These offerings signified the complete dedication of the offerers unto God. This is referred to in Rom. 12:1. (<see target="x-self">See ALTAR , SACRIFICE.</see>)</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Bush">
    <description>in which Jehovah appeared to Moses in the wilderness (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 3:2; Acts 7:30</reflink>). It is difficult to say what particular kind of plant or bush is here meant. Probably it was the mimosa or acacia. The words "in the bush" in Mark 12:26; Luke 20:37, mean "in the passage or paragraph on the bush;" i.e., in Ex. 3.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Butler">
    <description>properly a servant in charge of the wine (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 40:1-13; 41:9</reflink>). The Hebrew word, _mashkeh_, thus translated is rendered also (plural) "cup-bearers" (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 10:5; 2 Chr. 9:4</reflink>). Nehemiah (1:11) was cup-bearer to king Artaxerxes. It was a position of great responsibility and honour in royal households.</description>

  <item id="Butter">
    <description>(Heb. hemah), curdled milk (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 18:8; Judg. 5:25; 2 Sam. 17:29</reflink>), or butter in the form of the skim of hot milk or cream, called by the Arabs kaimak, a semi-fluid (<reflink target="XXX">Job 20:17; 29:6; Deut. 32:14</reflink>). The words of Prov. 30:33 have been rendered by some "the pressure [not churning] of milk bringeth forth cheese."</description>

    <description>(2.) A district in the north-west of Galilee, near to Tyre, containing twenty cities given to Hiram by Solomon as a reward for various services rendered to him in building the temple (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 9:13</reflink>), and as payment of the six score talents of gold he had borrowed from him. Hiram gave the cities this name because he was not pleased with the gift, the name signifying "good for nothing."

  <item id="Caesar">
    <description>the title assumed by the Roman emperors after Julius Caesar. In the New Testament this title is given to various emperors as sovereigns of Judaea without their accompanying distinctive proper names (<reflink target="XXX">John 19:15; Acts 17:7</reflink>). The Jews paid tribute to Caesar (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 22:17</reflink>), and all Roman citizens had the right of appeal to him (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 25:11</reflink>). The Caesars referred to in the New Testament are Augustus (<reflink target="XXX">Luke 2:1</reflink>), Tiberius (3:1; 20:22), Claudius (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 11:28</reflink>), and Nero (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 25:8; Phil. 4:22</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Caesara Philippi">
    <description>a city on the northeast of the marshy plain of el-Huleh, 120 miles north of Jerusalem, and 20 miles north of the Sea of Galilee, at the "upper source" of the Jordan, and near the base of Mount Hermon. It is mentioned in Matt. 16:13 and Mark 8:27 as the northern limit of our Lord's public ministry. According to some its original name was Baal-Gad (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 11:17</reflink>), or Baal-Hermon (<reflink target="XXX">Judg. 3:3; 1 Chr. 5:23</reflink>), when it was a Canaanite sanctuary of Baal. It was afterwards called Panium or Paneas, from a deep cavern full of water near the town. This name was given to the cavern by the Greeks of the Macedonian kingdom of Antioch because of its likeness to the grottos of Greece, which were always associated with the worship of their god Pan. Its modern name is Banias. Here Herod built a temple, which he dedicated to Augustus Caesar. This town was afterwards enlarged and embellished by Herod Philip, the tetrarch of Trachonitis, of whose territory it formed a part, and was called by him Caesarea Philippi, partly after his own name, and partly after that of the emperor Tiberius Caesar. It is thus distinguished from the Caesarea of Palestine. (<see target="x-self">See JORDAN.</see>)</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Caesarea">
    <description>(Palestinae), a city on the shore of the Mediterranean, on the great road from Tyre to Egypt, about 70 miles northwest of Jerusalem, at the northern extremity of the plain of Sharon. It was built by Herod the Great (B.C. 10), who named it after Caesar Augustus, hence called Caesarea Sebaste (Gr. Sebastos = "Augustus"), on the site of an old town called "Strato's Tower." It was the capital of the Roman province of Judaea, the seat of the governors or procurators, and the headquarters of the Roman troops. It was the great Gentile city of Palestine, with a spacious artificial harbour. It was adorned with many buildings of great splendour, after the manner of the Roman cities of the West. Here Cornelius the centurion was converted through the instrumentality of Peter (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 10:1, 24</reflink>), and thus for the first time the door of faith was opened to the Gentiles. Philip the evangelist resided here with his four daughters (21:8). From this place Saul sailed for his native Tarsus when forced to flee from Jerusalem (9:30), and here he landed when returning from his second missionary journey (18:22). He remained as a prisoner here for two years before his voyage to Rome (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 24:27; 25:1, 4, 6, 13</reflink>). Here on a "set day," when games were celebrated in the theatre in honour of the emperor Claudius, Herod Agrippa I. appeared among the people in great pomp, and in the midst of the idolatrous homage paid to him was suddenly smitten by an angel, and carried out a dying man. He was "eaten of worms" (12:19-23), thus perishing by the same loathsome disease as his granfather, Herod the Great. It still retains its ancient name Kaiseriyeh, but is now desolate. "The present inhabitants of the ruins are snakes, scorpions, lizards, wild boars, and jackals." It is described as the most desolate city of all Palestine.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Cage">
    <description>(Heb. kelub', Jer. 5:27, marg. "coop;" rendered "basket" in Amos 8:1), a basket of wicker-work in which birds were placed after being caught. In Rev. 18:2 it is the rendering of the Greek _phulake_, properly a prison or place of confinement.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Caiaphas">
    <description>the Jewish high priest (A.D. 27-36) at the beginning of our Lord's public ministry, in the reign of Tiberius (<reflink target="XXX">Luke 3:2</reflink>), and also at the time of his condemnation and crucifixion (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 26:3,57; John 11:49; 18:13, 14</reflink>). He held this office during the whole of Pilate's administration. His wife was the daughter of Annas, who had formerly been high priest, and was probably the vicar or deputy (Heb. sagan) of Caiaphas. He was of the sect of the Sadducees (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 5:17</reflink>), and was a member of the council when he gave his opinion that Jesus should be put to death "for the people, and that the whole nation perish not" (<reflink target="XXX">John 11:50</reflink>). In these words he unconsciously uttered a prophecy. "Like Saul, he was a prophet in spite of himself." Caiaphas had no power to inflict the punishment of death, and therefore Jesus was sent to Pilate, the Roman governor, that he might duly pronounce the sentence against him (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 27:2; John 18:28</reflink>). At a later period his hostility to the gospel is still manifest (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 4:6</reflink>). (<see target="x-self">See ANNAS.</see>)</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Cain">
    <description>a possession; a spear. (1.) The first-born son of Adam and Eve (Gen. 4). He became a tiller of the ground, as his brother Abel followed the pursuits of pastoral life. He was "a sullen, self-willed, haughty, vindictive man; wanting the religious element in his character, and defiant even in his attitude towards God." It came to pass "in process of time" (marg. "at the end of days"), i.e., probably on the Sabbath, that the two brothers presented their offerings to the Lord. Abel's offering was of the "firstlings of his flock and of the fat," while Cain's was "of the fruit of the ground." Abel's sacrifice was "more excellent" (<reflink target="XXX">Heb. 11:4</reflink>) than Cain's, and was accepted by God. On this account Cain was "very wroth," and cherished feelings of murderous hatred against his brother, and was at length guilty of the desperate outrage of putting him to death (<reflink target="XXX">1 John 3:12</reflink>). For this crime he was expelled from Eden, and henceforth led the life of an exile, bearing upon him some mark which God had set upon him in answer to his own cry for mercy, so that thereby he might be protected from the wrath of his fellow-men; or it may be that God only gave him some sign to assure him that he would not be slain (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 4:15</reflink>). Doomed to be a wanderer and a fugitive in the earth, he went forth into the "land of Nod", i.e., the land of "exile", which is said to have been in the "east of Eden," and there he built a city, the first we read of, and called it after his son's name, Enoch. His descendants are enumerated to the sixth generation. They gradually degenerated in their moral and spiritual condition till they became wholly corrupt before God. This corruption prevailed, and at length the Deluge was sent by God to prevent the final triumph of evil. (<see target="x-self">See ABEL.</see>)</description>
    <description>(2.) A town of the Kenites, a branch of the Midianites (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 15:57</reflink>), on the east edge of the mountain above Engedi; probably the "nest in a rock" mentioned by Balaam (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 24:21</reflink>). It is identified with the modern Yekin, 3 miles south-east of Hebron.</description>

  <item id="Cainan">
    <description>possession; smith. (1.) The fourth antediluvian patriarch, the eldest son of Enos. He was 70 years old at the birth of his eldest son Mahalaleel, after which he lived 840 years (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 5:9-14</reflink>), and was 910 years old when he died. He is also called Kenan (<reflink target="XXX">1 Chr. 1:2</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(2.) The son of Arphaxad (<reflink target="XXX">Luke 3:36</reflink>). He is nowhere named in the Old Testament. He is usually called the "second Cainan."</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Cake">
    <description>Cakes made of wheat or barley were offered in the temple. They were salted, but unleavened (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 29:2; Lev. 2:4</reflink>). In idolatrous worship thin cakes or wafers were offered "to the queen of heaven" (<reflink target="XXX">Jer. 7:18; 44:19</reflink>).</description>
    <description>Pancakes are described in 2 Sam. 13:8, 9. Cakes mingled with oil and baked in the oven are mentioned in Lev. 2:4, and "wafers unleavened anointed with oil," in Ex. 29:2; Lev. 8:26; 1 Chr. 23:29. "Cracknels," a kind of crisp cakes, were among the things Jeroboam directed his wife to take with her when she went to consult Ahijah the prophet at Shiloh (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 14:3</reflink>). Such hard cakes were carried by the Gibeonites when they came to Joshua (9:5, 12). They described their bread as "mouldy;" but the Hebrew word _nikuddim_, here used, ought rather to be rendered "hard as biscuit." It is rendered "cracknels" in 1 Kings 14:3. The ordinary bread, when kept for a few days, became dry and excessively hard. The Gibeonites pointed to this hardness of their bread as an evidence that they had come a long journey.</description>
    <description>We read also of honey-cakes (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 16:31</reflink>), "cakes of figs" (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 25:18</reflink>), "cake" as denoting a whole piece of bread (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 17:12</reflink>), and "a [round] cake of barley bread" (<reflink target="XXX">Judg. 7:13</reflink>). In Lev. 2 is a list of the different kinds of bread and cakes which were fit for offerings.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Calah">
    <description>one of the most ancient cities of Assyria. "Out of that land he [i.e., Nimrod] went forth into Assyria, and built Nineveh, Rehoboth-Ir, and Calah, and Resen" (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 10:11, R.V.</reflink>). Its site is now marked probably by the Nimrud ruins on the left bank of the Tigris. These cover an area of about 1,000 acres, and are second only in size and importance to the mass of ruins opposite Mosul. This city was at one time the capital of the empire, and was the residence of Sardanapalus and his successors down to the time of Sargon, who built a new capital, the modern Khorsabad. It has been conjectured that these four cities mentioned in Gen. 10:11 were afterwards all united into one and called Nineveh (q.v.).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Calamus">
    <description>the Latin for cane, Hebrew _Kaneh_, mentioned (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 30:23</reflink>) as one of the ingredients in the holy anointing oil, one of the sweet scents (<reflink target="XXX">Cant. 4:14</reflink>), and among the articles sold in the markets of Tyre (<reflink target="XXX">Ezek. 27:19</reflink>). The word designates an Oriental plant called the "sweet flag," the Acorus calamus of Linnaeus. It is elsewhere called "sweet cane" (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 43:24; Jer. 6:20</reflink>). It has an aromatic smell, and when its knotted stalk is cut and dried and reduced to powder, it forms an ingredient in the most precious perfumes. It was not a native of Palestine, but was imported from Arabia Felix or from India. It was probably that which is now known in India by the name of "lemon grass" or "ginger grass," the Andropogon schoenanthus. (<see target="x-self">See CANE.</see>)</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Calcol">
    <description>(<reflink target="XXX">1 Chr. 2:6</reflink>), sustenance, the same probably as Chalcol (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 4:31</reflink>), one of the four sages whom Solomon excelled in wisdom; for "he was wiser than all men."</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Caleb">
    <description>a dog. (1.) One of the three sons of Hezron of the tribe of Judah. He is also called Chelubai (<reflink target="XXX">1 Chr. 2:9</reflink>). His descendants are enumerated (18-20, 42-49).</description>
    <description>(2.) A "son of Hur, the firstborn of Ephratah" (<reflink target="XXX">1 Chr. 2:50</reflink>). Some would read the whole passage thus: "These [i.e., the list in ver. 42-49] were the sons of Caleb. The sons of Hur, the firstborn of Ephratah, were Shobal, etc." Thus Hur would be the name of the son and not the father of Caleb (ver. 19).</description>
    <description>(3.) The son of Jephunneh (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 13:6; 32:12; Josh. 14:6, 14</reflink>). He was one of those whom Moses sent to search the land in the second year after the Exodus. He was one of the family chiefs of the tribe of Judah. He and Joshua the son of Nun were the only two of the whole number who encouraged the people to go up and possess the land, and they alone were spared when a plague broke out in which the other ten spies perished (Num. 13; 14). All the people that had been numbered, from twenty years old and upward, perished in the wilderness except these two. The last notice we have of Caleb is when (being then eighty-five years of age) he came to Joshua at the camp at Gilgal, after the people had gained possession of the land, and reminded him of the promise Moses had made to him, by virtue of which he claimed a certain portion of the land of Kirjath-arba as his inheritance (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 14:6-15; 15:13-15; 21:10-12; 1 Sam. 25:2,3; 30:14</reflink>). He is called a "Kenezite" in Josh. 14:6,14. This may simply mean "son of Kenez" (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 32:12</reflink>). Some, however, read "Jephunneh, the son of Kenez," who was a descendant of Hezron, the son of Pharez, a grandson of Judah (<reflink target="XXX">1 Chr. 2:5</reflink>). This Caleb may possibly be identical with (2).</description>
    <description>(4.) Caleb gave his name apparently to a part of the south country (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 30:14</reflink>) of Judah, the district between Hebron and Carmel, which had been assigned to him. When he gave up the city of Hebron to the priests as a city of refuge, he retained possession of the surrounding country (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 21:11,12; comp. 1 Sam. 25:3</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Calf">
    <description>Calves were commonly made use of in sacrifices, and are therefore frequently mentioned in Scripture. The "fatted calf" was regarded as the choicest of animal food; it was frequently also offered as a special sacrifice (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 28:24; Amos 6:4; Luke 15:23</reflink>). The words used in Jer. 34:18, 19, "cut the calf in twain," allude to the custom of dividing a sacrifice into two parts, between which the parties ratifying a covenant passed (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 15:9, 10, 17, 18</reflink>). The sacrifice of the lips, i.e., priase, is called "the calves of our lips" (<reflink target="XXX">Hos. 14:2, R.V., "as bullocks the offering of our lips." Comp. Heb. 13:15; Ps. 116:7; Jer. 33:11</reflink>).</description>
    <description>The golden calf which Aaron made (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 32:4</reflink>) was probably a copy of the god Moloch rather than of the god Apis, the sacred ox or calf of Egypt. The Jews showed all through their history a tendency toward the Babylonian and Canaanitish idolatry rather than toward that of Egypt.</description>
    <description>Ages after this, Jeroboam, king of Israel, set up two idol calves, one at Dan, and the other at Bethel, that he might thus prevent the ten tribes from resorting to Jerusalem for worship (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 12:28</reflink>). These calves continued to be a snare to the people till the time of their captivity. The calf at Dan was carried away in the reign of Pekah by Tiglath-pileser, and that at Bethel ten years later, in the reign of Hoshea, by Shalmaneser (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 15:29; 17:33</reflink>). This sin of Jeroboam is almost always mentioned along with his name (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 15:28 etc.</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Calkers">
    <description>workmen skilled in stopping the seams of the deck or sides of vessels. The inhabitants of Gebel were employed in such work on Tyrian vessels (<reflink target="XXX">Ezek. 27:9, 27; marg., "strengtheners" or "stoppers of chinks"</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Call">
    <description>(1.) To cry for help, hence to pray (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 4:26</reflink>). Thus men are said to "call upon the name of the Lord" (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 2:21; 7:59; 9:14; Rom. 10:12; 1 Cor. 1:2</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(2.) God calls with respect to men when he designates them to some special office (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 31:2; Isa. 22:20; Acts 13:2</reflink>), and when he invites them to accept his offered grace (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 9:13; 11:28; 22:4</reflink>).</description>
    <description>In the message of the gospel his call is addressed to all men, to Jews and Gentiles alike (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 28:19; Mark 16:15; Rom. 9:24, 25</reflink>). But this universal call is not inseparably connected with salvation, although it leaves all to whom it comes inexcusable if they reject it (<reflink target="XXX">John 3:14-19; Matt. 22:14</reflink>).</description>
    <description>An effectual call is something more than the outward message of the Word of God to men. It is internal, and is the result of the enlightening and sanctifying influence of the Holy Spirit (<reflink target="XXX">John 16:14; Acts 26: 18; John 6:44</reflink>), effectually drawing men to Christ, and disposing and enabling them to receive the truth (<reflink target="XXX">John 6:45; Acts 16:14; Eph. 1:17</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Calling">
    <description>a profession, or as we usually say, a vocation (<reflink target="XXX">1 Cor. 7:20</reflink>). The "hope of your calling" in Eph. 4:4 is the hope resulting from your being called into the kingdom of God.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Calneh">
    <description>fort, one of the four cities founded by Nimrod (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 10:10</reflink>). It is the modern Niffer, a lofty mound of earth and rubbish situated in the marshes on the left, i.e., the east, bank of the Euphrates, but 30 miles distant from its present course, and about 60 miles south-south-east from Babylon. It is mentioned as one of the towns with which Tyre carried on trade. It was finally taken and probably destroyed by one of the Assyrian kings (<reflink target="XXX">Amos 6:2</reflink>). It is called Calno (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 10:9</reflink>) and Canneh (<reflink target="XXX">Ezek. 27:23</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Calvary">
    <description>only in Luke 23:33, the Latin name Calvaria, which was used as a translation of the Greek word _Kranion_, by which the Hebrew word _Gulgoleth_ was interpreted, "the place of a skull." It probably took this name from its shape, being a hillock or low, rounded, bare elevation somewhat in the form of a human skull. It is nowhere in Scripture called a "hill." The crucifixion of our Lord took place outside the city walls (<reflink target="XXX">Heb. 13:11-13</reflink>) and near the public thoroughfare. "This thing was not done in a corner." (<see target="x-self">See GOLGOTHA.</see>)</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Camel">
    <description>from the Hebrew _gamal_, "to repay" or "requite," as the camel does the care of its master. There are two distinct species of camels, having, however, the common characteristics of being "ruminants without horns, without muzzle, with nostrils forming oblique slits, the upper lip divided and separately movable and extensile, the soles of the feet horny, with two toes covered by claws, the limbs long, the abdomen drawn up, while the neck, long and slender, is bent up and down, the reverse of that of a horse, which is arched."</description>
    <description>(1.) The Bactrian camel is distinguished by two humps. It is a native of the high table-lands of Central Asia.</description>
    <description>(2.) The Arabian camel or dromedary, from the Greek _dromos_, "a runner" (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 60:6; Jer. 2:23</reflink>), has but one hump, and is a native of Western Asia or Africa.</description>
    <description>The camel was early used both for riding and as a beast of burden (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 24:64; 37:25</reflink>), and in war (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 30:17; Isa. 21:7</reflink>). Mention is made of the camel among the cattle given by Pharaoh to Abraham (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 12:16</reflink>). Its flesh was not to be eaten, as it was ranked among unclean animals (<reflink target="XXX">Lev. 11:4; Deut. 14:7</reflink>). Abraham's servant rode on a camel when he went to fetch a wife for Isaac (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 24:10, 11</reflink>). Jacob had camels as a portion of his wealth (30:43), as Abraham also had (24:35). He sent a present of thirty milch camels to his brother Esau (32:15). It appears to have been little in use among the Jews after the conquest. It is, however, mentioned in the history of David (<reflink target="XXX">1 Chr. 27:30</reflink>), and after the Exile (<reflink target="XXX">Ezra 2:67; Neh. 7:69</reflink>). Camels were much in use among other nations in the East. The queen of Sheba came with a caravan of camels when she came to see the wisdom of Solomon (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 10:2; 2 Chr. 9:1</reflink>). Benhadad of Damascus also sent a present to Elisha, "forty camels' burden" (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 8:9</reflink>).</description>
    <description>To show the difficulty in the way of a rich man's entering into the kingdom, our Lord uses the proverbial expression that it was easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 19:24</reflink>).</description>
    <description>To strain at (rather, out) a gnat and swallow a camel was also a proverbial expression (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 23:24</reflink>), used with reference to those who were careful to avoid small faults, and yet did not hesitate to commit the greatest sins. The Jews carefully filtered their wine before drinking it, for fear of swallowing along with it some insect forbidden in the law as unclean, and yet they omitted openly the "weightier matters" of the law.</description>
    <description>The raiment worn by John the Baptist was made of camel's hair (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 3:4; Mark 1:6</reflink>), by which he was distinguished from those who resided in royal palaces and wore soft raiment. This was also the case with Elijah (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 1:8</reflink>), who is called "a hairy man," from his wearing such raiment. "This is one of the most admirable materials for clothing; it keeps out the heat, cold, and rain." The "sackcloth" so often alluded to (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 1:8; Isa. 15:3; Zech. 13:4, etc.</reflink>) was probably made of camel's hair.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Camon">
    <description>full of stalks, a place (<reflink target="XXX">Judg. 10:5</reflink>) where Jair was buried. It has usually been supposed to have been a city of Gilead, on the east of Jordan. It is probably, however, the modern Tell-el-Kaimun, on the southern slopes of Carmel, the Jokneam of Carmel (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 12:22; 1 Kings 4:12</reflink>), since it is not at all unlikely that after he became judge, Jair might find it more convenient to live on the west side of Jordan; and that he was buried where he had lived.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Camp">
    <description>During their journeys across the wilderness, the twelve tribes formed encampments at the different places where they halted (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 16:13; Num. 2:3</reflink>). The diagram here given shows the position of the different tribes and the form of the encampment during the wanderings, according to Num. 1:53; 2:2-31; 3:29, 35, 38; 10:13-28.</description>
    <description>The area of the camp would be in all about 3 square miles. After the Hebrews entered Palestine, the camps then spoken of were exclusively warlike (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 11:5, 7; Judg. 5:19, 21; 7:1; 1 Sam. 29:1; 30:9, etc.</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Camphire">
    <description>(Heb. copher), mentioned in Cant. 1:14 (R.V., "henna-flowers"); 4:13 (R.V., "henna"), is the al-henna of the Arabs, a native of Egypt, producing clusters of small white and yellow odoriferous flowers, whence is made the Oleum Cyprineum. From its leaves is made the peculiar auburn dye with which Eastern women stain their nails and the palms of their hands. It is found only at Engedi, on the shore of the Dead Sea. It is known to botanists by the name Lawsonia alba or inermis, a kind of privet, which grows 6 or 8 feet high. The margin of the Authorized Version of the passages above referred to has "or cypress," not with reference to the conifer so called, but to the circumstance that one of the most highly appreciated species of this plant grew in the island of Cyprus.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Cana">
    <description>reedy, a town of Galilee, near Capernaum. Here our Lord wrought his first miracle, the turning of water into wine (<reflink target="XXX">John 2:1-11; 4:46</reflink>). It is also mentioned as the birth-place of Nathanael (21:2). It is not mentioned in the Old Testament. It has been identified with the modern Kana el-Jelil, also called Khurbet Kana, a place 8 or 9 miles north of Nazareth. Others have identified it with Kefr Kenna, which lies on the direct road to the Sea of Galilee, about 5 miles north-east of Nazareth, and 12 in a direct course from Tiberias. It is called "Cana of Galilee," to distinguish it from Cana of Asher (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 19:28</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Canaan">
    <description>(1.) The fourth son of Ham (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 10:6</reflink>). His descendants were under a curse in consequence of the transgression of his father (9:22-27). His eldest son, Zidon, was the father of the Sidonians and Phoenicians. He had eleven sons, who were the founders of as many tribes (10:15-18).</description>
    <description>(2.) The country which derived its name from the preceding. The name as first used by the Phoenicians denoted only the maritime plain on which Sidon was built. But in the time of Moses and Joshua it denoted the whole country to the west of the Jordan and the Dead Sea (<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 11:30</reflink>). In Josh. 5:12 the LXX. read, "land of the Phoenicians," instead of "land of Canaan."</description>
    <description>The name signifies "the lowlands," as distinguished from the land of Gilead on the east of Jordan, which was a mountainous district. The extent and boundaries of Canaan are fully set forth in different parts of Scripture (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 10:19; 17:8; Num. 13:29; 34:8</reflink>). (<see target="x-self">See CANAANITES, PALESTINE.</see>)</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Canaan, the language of">
    <description>mentioned in Isa. 19:18, denotes the language spoken by the Jews resident in Palestine. The language of the Canaanites and of the Hebrews was substantially the same. This is seen from the fragments of the Phoenician language which still survive, which show the closest analogy to the Hebrew. Yet the subject of the language of the "Canaanites" is very obscure. The cuneiform writing of Babylon, as well as the Babylonian language, was taught in the Canaanitish schools, and the clay tablets of Babylonian literature were stored in the Canaanitish libraries. Even the Babylonian divinities were borrowed by the Canaanites.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Canaanite">
    <description>a name given to the apostle Simon (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 10:4; Mark 3:18</reflink>). The word here does not, however, mean a descendant of Canaan, but is a translation, or rather almost a transliteration, of the Syriac word Kanenyeh (R.V. rendered "Cananaen"), which designates the Jewish sect of the Zealots. Hence he is called elsewhere (<reflink target="XXX">Luke 6:15</reflink>) "Simon Zelotes;" i.e., Simon of the sect of the Zealots. (<see target="x-self">See SIMON.</see>)</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Canaanites">
    <description>the descendants of Canaan, the son of Ham. Migrating from their original home, they seem to have reached the Persian Gulf, and to have there sojourned for some time. They thence "spread to the west, across the mountain chain of Lebanon to the very edge of the Mediterranean Sea, occupying all the land which later became Palestine, also to the north-west as far as the mountain chain of Taurus. This group was very numerous, and broken up into a great many peoples, as we can judge from the list of nations (Gen. 10), the 'sons of Canaan.'" Six different tribes are mentioned in Ex. 3:8, 17; 23:23; 33:2; 34:11. In Ex. 13:5 the "Perizzites" are omitted. The "Girgashites" are mentioned in addition to the foregoing in Deut. 7:1; Josh. 3:10.</description>
    <description>The "Canaanites," as distinguished from the Amalekites, the Anakim, and the Rephaim, were "dwellers in the lowlands" (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 13:29</reflink>), the great plains and valleys, the richest and most important parts of Palestine. Tyre and Sidon, their famous cities, were the centres of great commercial activity; and hence the name "Canaanite" came to signify a "trader" or "merchant" (<reflink target="XXX">Job 41:6; Prov. 31:24, lit. "Canaanites;" comp. Zeph. 1:11; Ezek. 17:4</reflink>). The name "Canaanite" is also sometimes used to designate the non-Israelite inhabitants of the land in general (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 12:6; Num. 21:3; Judg. 1:10</reflink>).</description>
    <description>The Israelites, when they were led to the Promised Land, were commanded utterly to destroy the descendants of Canaan then possessing it (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 23:23; Num. 33:52, 53; Deut. 20:16, 17</reflink>). This was to be done "by little and little," lest the beasts of the field should increase (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 23:29; Deut. 7:22, 23</reflink>). The history of these wars of conquest is given in the Book of Joshua. The extermination of these tribes, however, was never fully carried out. Jerusalem was not taken till the time of David (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 5:6, 7</reflink>). In the days of Solomon bond-service was exacted from the fragments of the tribes still remaining in the land (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 9:20, 21</reflink>). Even after the return from captivity survivors of five of the Canaanitish tribes were still found in the land.</description>
    <description>In the Tell-el-Amarna tablets Canaan is found under the forms of Kinakhna and Kinakhkhi. Under the name of Kanana the Canaanites appear on Egyptian monuments, wearing a coat of mail and helmet, and distinguished by the use of spear and javelin and the battle-axe. They were called Phoenicians by the Greeks and Poeni by the Romans. By race the Canaanites were Semitic. They were famous as merchants and seamen, as well as for their artistic skill. The chief object of their worship was the sun-god, who was addressed by the general name of Baal, "lord." Each locality had its special Baal, and the various local Baals were summed up under the name of Baalim, "lords."</description>

  <item id="Candace">
    <description>the queen of the Ethiopians whose "eunuch" or chamberlain was converted to Christianity by the instrumentality of Philip the evangelist (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 8:27</reflink>). The country which she ruled was called by the Greeks Meroe, in Upper Nubia. It was long the centre of commercial intercourse between Africa and the south of Asia, and hence became famous for its wealth (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 45:14</reflink>).</description>
    <description>It is somewhat singular that female sovereignty seems to have prevailed in Ethiopia, the name Candace (compare "Pharaoh," "Ptolemy," "Caesar") being a title common to several successive queens. It is probable that Judaism had taken root in Ethiopia at this time, and hence the visit of the queen's treasurer to Jerusalem to keep the feast. There is a tradition that Candace was herself converted to Christianity by her treasurer on his return, and that he became the apostle of Christianity in that whole region, carrying it also into Abyssinia. It is said that he also preached the gospel in Arabia Felix and in Ceylon, where he suffered martyrdom. (<see target="x-self">See PHILIP.</see>)</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Candle">
    <description>Heb. ner, Job 18:6; 29:3; Ps. 18:28; Prov. 24:20, in all which places the Revised Version and margin of Authorized Version have "lamp," by which the word is elsewhere frequently rendered. The Hebrew word denotes properly any kind of candle or lamp or torch. It is used as a figure of conscience (<reflink target="XXX">Prov. 20:27</reflink>), of a Christian example (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 5:14, 15</reflink>), and of prosperity (<reflink target="XXX">Job 21:17; Prov. 13:9</reflink>).</description>

  <item id="Candlestick">
    <description>the lamp-stand, "candelabrum," which Moses was commanded to make for the tabernacle, according to the pattern shown him. Its form is described in Ex. 25:31-40; 37:17-24, and may be seen represented on the Arch of Titus at Rome. It was among the spoils taken by the Romans from the temple of Jerusalem (A.D. 70). It was made of fine gold, and with the utensils belonging to it was a talent in weight.</description>
    <description>The tabernacle was a tent without windows, and thus artificial light was needed. This was supplied by the candlestick, which, however, served also as a symbol of the church or people of God, who are "the light of the world." The light which "symbolizes the knowledge of God is not the sun or any natural light, but an artificial light supplied with a specially prepared oil; for the knowledge of God is in truth not natural nor common to all men, but furnished over and above nature."</description>
    <description>This candlestick was placed on the south side of the Holy Place, opposite the table of shewbread (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 27:21; 30:7, 8; Lev. 24:3; 1 Sam. 3:3</reflink>). It was lighted every evening, and was extinguished in the morning. In the morning the priests trimmed the seven lamps, borne by the seven branches, with golden snuffers, carrying away the ashes in golden dishes (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 25:38</reflink>), and supplying the lamps at the same time with fresh oil. What ultimately became of the candlestick is unknown.</description>
    <description>In Solomon's temple there were ten separate candlesticks of pure gold, five on the right and five on the left of the Holy Place (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 7:49; 2 Chr. 4:7</reflink>). Their structure is not mentioned. They were carried away to Babylon (<reflink target="XXX">Jer. 52:19</reflink>).</description>
    <description>In the temple erected after the Exile there was again but one candlestick, and like the first, with seven branches. It was this which was afterwards carried away by Titus to Rome, where it was deposited in the Temple of Peace. When Genseric plundered Rome, he is said to have carried it to Carthage (A.D. 455). It was recaptured by Belisarius (A.D. 533), and carried to Constantinople and thence to Jerusalem, where it finally disappeared.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Cane">
    <description>a tall sedgy plant with a hollow stem, growing in moist places. In Isa. 43:24; Jer. 6:20, the Hebrew word _kaneh_ is thus rendered, giving its name to the plant. It is rendered "reed" in 1 Kings 14:15; Job 40:21; Isa. 19:6; 35:7. In Ps. 68:30 the expression "company of spearmen" is in the margin and the Revised Version "beasts of the reeds," referring probably to the crocodile or the hippopotamus as a symbol of Egypt. In 2 Kings 18:21; Isa. 36:6; Ezek. 29:6, 7, the reference is to the weak, fragile nature of the reed. (<see target="x-self">See CALAMUS.</see>)</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Canker">
    <description>a gangrene or mortification which gradually spreads over the whole body (<reflink target="XXX">2 Tim. 2:17</reflink>). In James 5:3 "cankered" means "rusted" (R.V.) or tarnished.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Cankerworm">
    <description>(Heb. yelek), "the licking locust," which licks up the grass of the field; probably the locust at a certain stage of its growth, just as it emerges from the caterpillar state (<reflink target="XXX">Joel 1:4; 2:25</reflink>). The word is rendered "caterpillar" in Ps. 105:34; Jer. 51:14, 17 (but R.V. "canker-worm"). "It spoileth and fleeth away" (<reflink target="XXX">Nah. 3:16</reflink>), or as some read the passage, "The cankerworm putteth off [i.e., the envelope of its wings], and fleeth away."</description>

  <item id="Canneh">
    <description>Mentioned only in Ezek. 27:23. (<see target="x-self">See CALNEH.</see>)</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Canon">
    <description>This word is derived from a Hebrew and Greek word denoting a reed or cane. Hence it means something straight, or something to keep straight; and hence also a rule, or something ruled or measured. It came to be applied to the Scriptures, to denote that they contained the authoritative rule of faith and practice, the standard of doctrine and duty. A book is said to be of canonical authority when it has a right to take a place with the other books which contain a revelation of the Divine will. Such a right does not arise from any ecclesiastical authority, but from the evidence of the inspired authorship of the book. The canonical (i.e., the inspired) books of the Old and New Testaments, are a complete rule, and the only rule, of faith and practice. They contain the whole supernatural revelation of God to men. The New Testament Canon was formed gradually under divine guidance. The different books as they were written came into the possession of the Christian associations which began to be formed soon after the day of Pentecost; and thus slowly the canon increased till all the books were gathered together into one collection containing the whole of the twenty-seven New Testament inspired books. Historical evidence shows that from about the middle of the second century this New Testament collection was substantially such as we now possess. Each book contained in it is proved to have, on its own ground, a right to its place; and thus the whole is of divine authority.</description>
    <description>The Old Testament Canon is witnessed to by the New Testament writers. Their evidence is conclusive. The quotations in the New from the Old are very numerous, and the references are much more numerous. These quotations and references by our Lord and the apostles most clearly imply the existence at that time of a well-known and publicly acknowledged collection of Hebrew writings under the designation of "The Scriptures;" "The Law and the Prophets and the Psalms;" "Moses and the Prophets," etc. The appeals to these books, moreover, show that they were regarded as of divine authority, finally deciding all questions of which they treat; and that the whole collection so recognized consisted only of the thirty-nine books which we now posses. Thus they endorse as genuine and authentic the canon of the Jewish Scriptures. The Septuagint Version (q.v.) also contained every book we now have in the Old Testament Scriptures. As to the time at which the Old Testament canon was closed, there are many considerations which point to that of Ezra and Nehemiah, immediately after the return from Babylonian exile.

  <item id="Capernaum">
    <description>Nahum's town, a Galilean city frequently mentioned in the history of our Lord. It is not mentioned in the Old Testament. After our Lord's expulsion from Nazareth (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 4:13-16; Luke 4:16-31</reflink>), Capernaum became his "own city." It was the scene of many acts and incidents of his life (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 8:5, 14, 15; 9:2-6, 10-17; 15:1-20; Mark 1:32-34, etc.</reflink>). The impenitence and unbelief of its inhabitants after the many evidences our Lord gave among them of the truth of his mission, brought down upon them a heavy denunciation of judgement (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 11:23</reflink>).</description>
    <description>It stood on the western shore of the Sea of Galilee. The "land of Gennesaret," near, if not in, which it was situated, was one of the most prosperous and crowded districts of Palestine. This city lay on the great highway from Damascus to Acco and Tyre. It has been identified with Tell Hum, about two miles south-west of where the Jordan flows into the lake. Here are extensive ruins of walls and foundations, and also the remains of what must have been a beautiful synagogue, which it is conjectured may have been the one built by the centurion (<reflink target="XXX">Luke 7:5</reflink>), in which our Lord frequently taught (<reflink target="XXX">John 6:59; Mark 1:21; Luke 4:33</reflink>). Others have conjectured that the ruins of the city are to be found at Khan Minyeh, some three miles further to the south on the shore of the lake. "If Tell Hum be Capernaum, the remains spoken of are without doubt the ruins of the synagogue built by the Roman centurion, and one of the most sacred places on earth. It was in this building that our Lord gave the well-known discourse in John 6; and it was not without a certain strange feeling that on turning over a large block we found the pot of manna engraved on its face, and remembered the words, 'I am that bread of life: your fathers did eat manna in the wilderness, and are dead.'", (The Recovery of Jerusalem.)</description>

  <item id="Caphtor">
    <description>a chaplet, the original seat of the Philistines (<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 2:23; Jer. 47:4; Amos 9:7</reflink>). The name is found written in hieroglyphics in the temple of Kom Ombos in Upper Egypt. But the exact situation of Caphtor is unknown, though it is supposed to be Crete, since the Philistines seem to be meant by the "Cherethites" in 1 Sam. 30:14 (<see target="x-self">see also 2 Sam. 8:18</see>). It may, however, have been a part of Egypt, the Caphtur in the north Delta, since the Caphtorim were of the same race as the Mizraite people (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 10:14; 1 Chr. 1:12</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Cappadocia">
    <description>the easternmost and the largest province of Asia Minor. Christianity very early penetrated into this country (<reflink target="XXX">1 Pet. 1:1</reflink>). On the day of Pentecost there were Cappadocians at Jerusalem (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 2:9</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Captain">
    <description>(1.) Heb. sar (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 22:2; 2 Sam. 23:19</reflink>). Rendered "chief," Gen. 40:2; 41:9; rendered also "prince," Dan. 1:7; "ruler," Judg. 9:30; "governor,' 1 Kings 22:26. This same Hebrew word denotes a military captain (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 18:21; 2 Kings 1:9; Deut. 1:15; 1 Sam. 18:13, etc.</reflink>), the "captain of the body-guard" (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 37:36; 39:1; 41:10; Jer. 40:1</reflink>), or, as the word may be rendered, "chief of the executioners" (marg.). The officers of the king's body-guard frequently acted as executioners. Nebuzar-adan (<reflink target="XXX">Jer. 39:13</reflink>) and Arioch (<reflink target="XXX">Dan. 2:14</reflink>) held this office in Babylon.</description>
    <description>The "captain of the guard" mentioned in Acts 28:16 was the Praetorian prefect, the commander of the Praetorian troops.</description>
    <description>(2.) Another word (Heb. katsin) so translated denotes sometimes a military (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 10:24; Judg. 11:6, 11; Isa. 22:3 "rulers;" Dan. 11:18</reflink>) and sometimes a civil command, a judge, magistrate, Arab. _kady_, (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 1:10; 3:6; Micah 3:1, 9</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(3.) It is also the rendering of a Hebrew word (shalish) meaning "a third man," or "one of three." The LXX. render in plural by _tristatai_; i.e., "soldiers fighting from chariots," so called because each war-chariot contained three men, one of whom acted as charioteer while the other two fought (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 14:7; 15:4; 1 Kings 9:22; comp. 2 Kings 9:25</reflink>). This word is used also to denote the king's body-guard (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 10:25; 1 Chr. 12:18; 2 Chr. 11:11</reflink>) or aides-de-camp.</description>
    <description>(4.) The "captain of the temple" mentioned in Acts 4:1 and 5:24 was not a military officer, but superintendent of the guard of priests and Levites who kept watch in the temple by night. (Comp. "the ruler of the house of God," 1 Chr. 9:11; 2 Chr. 31:13; Neh. 11:11.)</description>
    <description>(5.) The Captain of our salvation is a name given to our Lord (<reflink target="XXX">Heb. 2:10</reflink>), because he is the author and source of our salvation, the head of his people, whom he is conducting to glory. The "captain of the Lord's host" (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 5:14, 15</reflink>) is the name given to that mysterious person who manifested himself to Abraham (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 12:7</reflink>), and to Moses in the bush (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 3:2, 6, etc.</reflink>) the Angel of the covenant. (<see target="x-self">See ANGEL.</see>)</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Captive">
    <description>one taken in war. Captives were often treated with great cruelty and indignity (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 20:32; Josh. 10:24; Judg. 1:7; 2 Sam. 4:12; Judg. 8:7; 2 Sam. 12:31; 1 Chr. 20:3</reflink>). When a city was taken by assault, all the men were slain, and the women and children carried away captive and sold as slaves (Isa. 20; 47:3; 2 Chr. 28:9-15; Ps. 44:12; Joel 3:3), and exposed to the most cruel treatment (<reflink target="XXX">Nah. 3:10; Zech. 14:2; Esther 3:13; 2 Kings 8:12; Isa. 13:16, 18</reflink>). Captives were sometimes carried away into foreign countries, as was the case with the Jews (<reflink target="XXX">Jer. 20:5; 39:9, 10; 40:7</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Captivity">
    <description>(1.) Of Israel. The kingdom of the ten tribes was successively invaded by several Assyrian kings. Pul (q.v.) imposed a tribute on Menahem of a thousand talents of silver (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 15:19, 20; 1 Chr. 5:26</reflink>) (B.C. 762), and Tiglath-pileser, in the days of Pekah (B.C. 738), carried away the trans-Jordanic tribes and the inhabitants of Galilee into Assyria (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 15:29; Isa. 9:1</reflink>). Subsequently Shalmaneser invaded Israel and laid siege to Samaria, the capital of the kingdom. During the siege he died, and was succeeded by Sargon, who took the city, and transported the great mass of the people into Assyria (B.C. 721), placing them in Halah and in Habor, and in the cities of the Medes (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 17:3, 5</reflink>). Samaria was never again inhabited by the Israelites. The families thus removed were carried to distant cities, many of them not far from the Caspian Sea, and their place was supplied by colonists from Babylon and Cuthah, etc. (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 17:24</reflink>). Thus terminated the kingdom of the ten tribes, after a separate duration of two hundred and fifty-five years (B.C. 975-721).</description>
    <description>Many speculations have been indulged in with reference to these ten tribes. But we believe that all, except the number that probably allied themselves with Judah and shared in their restoration under Cyrus, are finally lost.</description>
    <description>"Like the dew on the mountain, Like the foam on the river, Like the bubble on the fountain, They are gone, and for ever."</description>
    <description>(2.) Of Judah. In the third year of Jehoiachim, the eighteenth king of Judah (B.C. 605), Nebuchadnezzar having overcome the Egyptians at Carchemish, advanced to Jerusalem with a great army. After a brief siege he took that city, and carried away the vessels of the sanctuary to Babylon, and dedicated them in the Temple of Belus (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 24:1; 2 Chr. 36:6, 7; Dan. 1:1, 2</reflink>). He also carried away the treasures of the king, whom he made his vassal. At this time, from which is dated the "seventy years" of captivity (Jer. 25; Dan. 9:1, 2), Daniel and his companions were carried to Babylon, there to be brought up at the court and trained in all the learning of the Chaldeans. After this, in the fifth year of Jehoiakim, a great national fast was appointed (<reflink target="XXX">Jer. 36:9</reflink>), during which the king, to show his defiance, cut up the leaves of the book of Jeremiah's prophecies as they were read to him in his winter palace, and threw them into the fire. In the same spirit he rebelled against Nebuchadnezzar (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 24:1</reflink>), who again a second time (B.C. 598) marched against Jerusalem, and put Jehoiachim to death, placing his son Jehoiachin on the throne in his stead. But Jehoiachin's counsellors displeasing Nebuchadnezzar, he again a third time turned his army against Jerusalem, and carried away to Babylon a second detachment of Jews as captives, to the number of 10,000 (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 24:13; Jer. 24:1; 2 Chr. 36:10</reflink>), among whom were the king, with his mother and all his princes and officers, also Ezekiel, who with many of his companions were settled on the banks of the river Chebar (q.v.). He also carried away all the remaining treasures of the temple and the palace, and the golden vessels of the sanctuary.</description>
    <description>Mattaniah, the uncle of Jehoiachin, was now made king over what remained of the kingdom of Judah, under the name of Zedekiah (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 24:17; 2 Chr. 36:10</reflink>). After a troubled reign of eleven years his kingdom came to an end (<reflink target="XXX">2 Chr. 36:11</reflink>). Nebuchadnezzar, with a powerful army, besieged Jerusalem, and Zedekiah became a prisoner in Babylon. His eyes were put out, and he was kept in close confinement till his death (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 25:7</reflink>). The city was spoiled of all that was of value, and then given up to the flames. The temple and palaces were consumed, and the walls of the city were levelled with the ground (B.C. 586), and all that remained of the people, except a number of the poorest class who were left to till the ground and dress the vineyards, were carried away captives to Babylon. This was the third and last deportation of Jewish captives. The land was now utterly desolate, and was abondoned to anarchy.</description>
    <description>In the first year of his reign as king of Babylon (B.C. 536), Cyrus issued a decree liberating the Jewish captives, and permitting them to return to Jerusalem and rebuild the city and the temple (<reflink target="XXX">2 Chr. 36:22, 23; Ezra 1; 2</reflink>). The number of the people forming the first caravan, under Zerubbabel, amounted in all to 42,360 (<reflink target="XXX">Ezra 2:64, 65</reflink>), besides 7,337 men-servants and maid-servants. A considerable number, 12,000 probably, from the ten tribes who had been carried away into Assyria no doubt combined with this band of liberated captives.</description>
    <description>At a later period other bands of the Jews returned (1) under Ezra (7:7) (B.C. 458), and (2) Nehemiah (7:66) (B.C. 445). But the great mass of the people remained still in the land to which they had been carried, and became a portion of the Jews of the "dispersion" (<reflink target="XXX">John 7:35; 1 Pet. 1:1</reflink>). The whole number of the exiles that chose to remain was probably about six times the number of those who returned.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Carbuncle">
    <description>(<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 28:17; 39:10; Ezek. 28:13</reflink>). Heb. barkath; LXX. smaragdos; Vulgate, smaragdus; Revised Version, marg., "emerald." The Hebrew word is from a root meaning "to glitter," "lighten," "flash." When held up to the sun, this gem shines like a burning coal, a dark-red glowing coal, and hence is called "carbunculus", i.e., a little coal. It was one of the jewels in the first row of the high priest's breastplate. It has been conjectured by some that the garnet is meant. In Isa. 54:12 the Hebrew word is _'ekdah_, used in the prophetic description of the glory and beauty of the mansions above. Next to the diamond it is the hardest and most costly of all precious stones.</description>

  <item id="Carcase">

  </item>
  <item id="Carchemish">
    <description>fortress of Chemosh, a city on the west bank of the Euphrates (<reflink target="XXX">Jer. 46:2; 2 Chr. 35:20</reflink>), not, as was once supposed, the Circesium at the confluence of the Chebar and the Euphrates, but a city considerably higher up the river, and commanding the ordinary passage of the Euphrates; probably identical with Hierapolis. It was the capital of the kingdom of the northern Hittites. The Babylonian army, under Nebuchadnezzar, the son of Nabopolassar, here met and conquered the army of Pharaoh-necho, king of Egypt (B.C. 607). It is mentioned in monuments in B.C. 1600 and down to B.C. 717.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Carmel">
    <description>a park; generally with the article, "the park." (1.) A prominent headland of Central Palestine, consisting of several connected hills extending from the plain of Esdraelon to the sea, a distance of some 12 miles or more. At the east end, in its highest part, it is 1,728 feet high, and at the west end it forms a promontory to the bay of Acre about 600 feet above the sea. It lay within the tribe of Asher. It was here, at the east end of the ridge, at a place called el-Mukhrakah (i.e., the place of burning), that Elijah brought back the people to their allegiance to God, and slew the prophets of Baal (1 Kings 18). Here were consumed the "fifties" of the royal guard; and here also Elisha received the visit of the bereaved mother whose son was restored by him to life (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 4:25-37</reflink>). "No mountain in or around Palestine retains its ancient beauty so much as Carmel. Two or three villages and some scattered cottages are found on it; its groves are few but luxuriant; it is no place for crags and precipices or rocks of wild goats; but its surface is covered with a rich and constant verdure." "The whole mountain-side is dressed with blossom, and flowering shrubs, and fragrant herbs." The western extremity of the ridge is, however, more rocky and bleak than the eastern. The head of the bride in Cant. 7:5 is compared to Carmel. It is ranked with Bashan on account of its rich pastures (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 33:9; Jer. 50:19; Amos 1:2</reflink>). The whole ridge is deeply furrowed with rocky ravines filled with dense jungle. There are many caves in its sides, which at one time were inhabited by swarms of monks. These caves are referred to in Amos 9:3. To them Elijah and Elisha often resorted (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 18:19, 42; 2 Kings 2:25</reflink>). On its north-west summit there is an ancient establishment of Carmelite monks. Vineyards have recently been planted on the mount by the German colonists of Haifa. The modern Arabic name of the mount is Kurmul, but more commonly Jebel Mar Elyas, i.e., Mount St. Elias, from the Convent of Elias.</description>
    <description>(2.) A town in the hill country of Judah (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 15:55</reflink>), the residence of Nabal (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 25:2, 5, 7, 40</reflink>), and the native place of Abigail, who became David's wife (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 27:3</reflink>). Here king Uzziah had his vineyards (<reflink target="XXX">2 Chr. 26:10</reflink>). The ruins of this town still remain under the name of Kurmul, about 10 miles south-south-east of Hebron, close to those of Maon.</description>

  <item id="Carnal">
    <description>Unconverted men are so called (<reflink target="XXX">1 Cor. 3:3</reflink>). They are represented as of a "carnal mind, which is enmity against God" (<reflink target="XXX">Rom. 8:6, 7</reflink>). Enjoyments that minister to the wants and desires of man's animal nature are so called (<reflink target="XXX">Rom. 15:27; 1 Cor. 9:11</reflink>). The ceremonial of the Mosaic law is spoken of as "carnal," because it related to things outward, the bodies of men and of animals, and the purification of the flesh (<reflink target="XXX">Heb. 7:16; 9:10</reflink>). The weapons of Christian warfare are "not carnal", that is, they are not of man's device, nor are wielded by human power (<reflink target="XXX">2 Cor. 10:4</reflink>).</description>

  <item id="Carpenter">
    <description>an artificer in stone, iron, and copper, as well as in wood (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 5:11; 1 Chr. 14:1; Mark 6:3</reflink>). The tools used by carpenters are mentioned in 1 Sam. 13:19, 20; Judg. 4:21; Isa. 10:15; 44:13. It was said of our Lord, "Is not this the carpenter's son?" (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 13:55</reflink>); also, "Is not this the carpenter?" (<reflink target="XXX">Mark 6:3</reflink>). Every Jew, even the rabbis, learned some handicraft: Paul was a tentmaker. "In the cities the carpenters would be Greeks, and skilled workmen; the carpenter of a provincial village could only have held a very humble position, and secured a very moderate competence."</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Carriage">
    <description>In the Authorized Version this word is found as the rendering of many different words. In Judg. 18:21 it means valuables, wealth, or booty. In Isa. 46:1 (R.V., "the things that ye carried about") the word means a load for a beast of burden. In 1 Sam. 17:22 and Isa. 10:28 it is the rendering of a word ("stuff" in 1 Sam. 10:22) meaning implements, equipments, baggage. The phrase in Acts 21:15, "We took up our carriages," means properly, "We packed up our baggage," as in the Revised Version.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Cart">
    <description>a vehicle moving on wheels, and usually drawn by oxen (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 6:3</reflink>). The Hebrew word thus rendered, _'agalah_ (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 6:7, 8</reflink>), is also rendered "wagon" (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 45:19</reflink>). It is used also to denote a war-chariot (<reflink target="XXX">Ps. 46:9</reflink>). Carts were used for the removal of the ark and its sacred utensils (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 7:3, 6</reflink>). After retaining the ark amongst them for seven months, the Philistines sent it back to the Israelites. On this occasion they set it in a new cart, probably a rude construction, with solid wooden wheels like that still used in Western Asia, which was drawn by two milch cows, which conveyed it straight to Beth-shemesh.</description>
    <description>A "cart rope," for the purpose of fastening loads on carts, is used (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 5:18</reflink>) as a symbol of the power of sinful pleasures or habits over him who indulges them. (<see target="x-self">See CORD.</see>) In Syria and Palestine wheel-carriages for any other purpose than the conveyance of agricultural produce are almost unknown.</description>

  <item id="Carve">
    <description>The arts of engraving and carving were much practised among the Jews. They were practised in connection with the construction of the tabernacle and the temple (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 31:2, 5; 35:33; 1 Kings 6:18, 35; Ps. 74:6</reflink>), as well as in the ornamentation of the priestly dresses (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 28:9-36; Zech. 3:9; 2 Chr. 2:7, 14</reflink>). Isaiah (44:13-17) gives a minute description of the process of carving idols of wood.</description>

    <description>(1.) Hebrew _kiddah'_, i.e., "split." One of the principal spices of the holy anointing oil (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 30:24</reflink>), and an article of commerce (<reflink target="XXX">Ezek. 27:19</reflink>). It is the inner bark of a tree resembling the cinnamon (q.v.), the Cinnamomum cassia of botanists, and was probably imported from India.</description>
    <description>(2.) Hebrew pl. _ketzi'oth_ (<reflink target="XXX">Ps. 45:8</reflink>). Mentioned in connection with myrrh and aloes as being used to scent garments. It was probably prepared from the peeled bark, as the Hebrew word suggests, of some kind of cinnamon.</description>

    <description>a military fortress (<reflink target="XXX">1 Chr. 11:7</reflink>), also probably a kind of tower used by the priests for making known anything discovered at a distance (<reflink target="XXX">1 Chr. 6:54</reflink>). Castles are also mentioned (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 25:16</reflink>) as a kind of watch-tower, from which shepherds kept watch over their flocks by night. The "castle" into which the chief captain commanded Paul to be brought was the quarters of the Roman soldiers in the fortress of Antonia (so called by Herod after his patron Mark Antony), which was close to the north-west corner of the temple (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 21:34</reflink>), which it commanded.</description>

It may have been a species of locust, or the name of one of the transformations through which the locust passes, locust-grub. It is also found (<reflink target="XXX">Ps. 105:34; Jer. 51:14, 27; R.V., "cankerworm"</reflink>) as the rendering of a different Hebrew word, _yelek_, a word elsewhere rendered "cankerworm" (q.v.), Joel 1:4; 2:25.

  <item id="Cattle">
    <description>abounded in the Holy Land. To the rearing and management of them the inhabitants chiefly devoted themselves (<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 8:13; 12:21; 1 Sam. 11:5; 12:3; Ps. 144:14; Jer. 3:24</reflink>). They may be classified as,</description>
    <description>(1.) Neat cattle. Many hundreds of these were yearly consumed in sacrifices or used for food. The finest herds were found in Bashan, beyond Jordan (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 32:4</reflink>). Large herds also pastured on the wide fertile plains of Sharon. They were yoked to the plough (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 19:19</reflink>), and were employed for carrying burdens (<reflink target="XXX">1 Chr. 12:40</reflink>). They were driven with a pointed rod (<reflink target="XXX">Judg. 3:31</reflink>) or goad (q.v.).</description>
    <description>According to the Mosaic law, the mouths of cattle employed for the threshing-floor were not to be muzzled, so as to prevent them from eating of the provender over which they trampled (<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 25:4</reflink>). Whosoever stole and sold or slaughtered an ox must give five in satisfaction (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 22:1</reflink>); but if it was found alive in the possession of him who stole it, he was required to make double restitution only (22:4). If an ox went astray, whoever found it was required to bring it back to its owner (23:4; Deut. 22:1, 4). An ox and an ass could not be yoked together in the plough (<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 22:10</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(2.) Small cattle. Next to herds of neat cattle, sheep formed the most important of the possessions of the inhabitants of Palestine (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 12:16; 13:5; 26:14; 21:27; 29:2, 3</reflink>). They are frequently mentioned among the booty taken in war (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 31:32; Josh. 6:21; 1 Sam. 14:32; 15:3</reflink>). There were many who were owners of large flocks (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 25:2; 2 Sam. 12:2, comp. Job 1:3</reflink>). Kings also had shepherds "over their flocks" (<reflink target="XXX">1 Chr. 27:31</reflink>), from which they derived a large portion of their revenue (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 17:29; 1 Chr. 12:40</reflink>). The districts most famous for their flocks of sheep were the plain of Sharon (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 65: 10</reflink>), Mount Carmel (<reflink target="XXX">Micah 7:14</reflink>), Bashan and Gilead (<reflink target="XXX">Micah 7:14</reflink>). In patriarchal times the flocks of sheep were sometimes tended by the daughters of the owners. Thus Rachel, the daughter of Laban, kept her father's sheep (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 29:9</reflink>); as also Zipporah and her six sisters had charge of their father Jethro's flocks (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 2:16</reflink>). Sometimes they were kept by hired shepherds (<reflink target="XXX">John 10:12</reflink>), and sometimes by the sons of the family (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 16:11; 17:15</reflink>). The keepers so familiarized their sheep with their voices that they knew them, and followed them at their call. Sheep, but more especially rams and lambs, were frequently offered in sacrifice. The shearing of sheep was a great festive occasion (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 25:4; 2 Sam. 13:23</reflink>). They were folded at night, and guarded by their keepers against the attacks of the lion (<reflink target="XXX">Micah 5:8</reflink>), the bear (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 17:34</reflink>), and the wolf (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 10:16; John 10:12</reflink>). They were liable to wander over the wide pastures and go astray (<reflink target="XXX">Ps. 119:176; Isa. 53:6; Hos. 4:16; Matt. 18:12</reflink>).</description>
    <description>Goats also formed a part of the pastoral wealth of Palestine (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 15:9; 32:14; 37:31</reflink>). They were used both for sacrifice and for food (<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 14:4</reflink>), especially the young males (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 27:9, 14, 17; Judg. 6:19; 13:15; 1 Sam. 16:20</reflink>). Goat's hair was used for making tent cloth (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 26:7; 36:14</reflink>), and for mattresses and bedding (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 19:13, 16</reflink>).

  <item id="Cave">
    <description>There are numerous natural caves among the limestone rocks of Syria, many of which have been artificially enlarged for various purposes.</description>
    <description>The first notice of a cave occurs in the history of Lot (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 19:30</reflink>).</description>
    <description>The next we read of is the cave of Machpelah (q.v.), which Abraham purchased from the sons of Heth (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 25:9, 10</reflink>). It was the burying-place of Sarah and of Abraham himself, also of Isaac, Rebekah, Leah, and Jacob (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 49:31; 50:13</reflink>).</description>
    <description>The cave of Makkedah, into which the five Amorite kings retired after their defeat by Joshua (10:16, 27).</description>
    <description>The cave of Adullam (q.v.), an immense natural cavern, where David hid himself from Saul (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 22:1, 2</reflink>).</description>
    <description>The cave of Engedi (q.v.), now called 'Ain Jidy, i.e., the "Fountain of the Kid", where David cut off the skirt of Saul's robe (24:4). Here he also found a shelter for himself and his followers to the number of 600 (23:29; 24:1). "On all sides the country is full of caverns which might serve as lurking-places for David and his men, as they do for outlaws at the present day."</description>
    <description>The cave in which Obadiah hid the prophets (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 18:4</reflink>) was probably in the north, but it cannot be identified.</description>
    <description>The cave of Elijah (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 19:9</reflink>), and the "cleft" of Moses on Horeb (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 33:22</reflink>), cannot be determined.</description>
    <description>In the time of Gideon the Israelites took refuge from the Midianites in dens and caves, such as abounded in the mountain regions of Manasseh (<reflink target="XXX">Judg. 6:2</reflink>).</description>
    <description>Caves were frequently used as dwelling-places (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 24:21; Cant. 2:14; Jer. 49:16; Obad. 1:3</reflink>). "The excavations at Deir Dubban, on the south side of the wady leading to Santa Hanneh, are probably the dwellings of the Horites," the ancient inhabitants of Idumea Proper. The pits or cavities in rocks were also sometimes used as prisons (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 24:22; 51:14; Zech. 9:11</reflink>). Those which had niches in their sides were occupied as burying-places (<reflink target="XXX">Ezek. 32:23; John 11:38</reflink>).</description>

  <item id="Cedar">
    <description>(Heb. e'rez, Gr. kedros, Lat. cedrus), a tree very frequently mentioned in Scripture. It was stately (<reflink target="XXX">Ezek. 31:3-5</reflink>), long-branched (<reflink target="XXX">Ps. 80:10; 92:12; Ezek. 31:6-9</reflink>), odoriferous (<reflink target="XXX">Cant. 4:11; Hos. 14:6</reflink>), durable, and therefore much used for boards, pillars, and ceilings (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 6:9, 10; 7:2; Jer. 22:14</reflink>), for masts (<reflink target="XXX">Ezek. 27:5</reflink>), and for carved images (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 44:14</reflink>).</description>
    <description>It grew very abundantly in Palestine, and particularly on Lebanon, of which it was "the glory" (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 35:2; 60:13</reflink>). Hiram supplied Solomon with cedar trees from Lebanon for various purposes connected with the construction of the temple and the king's palace (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 5:11; 7:2, 7; 1 Kings 5:6, 8,10; 6:9, 10, 15, 16, 18, 20; 7:2, 3, 7, 11, 12; 9:11, etc.</reflink>). Cedars were used also in the building of the second temple under Zerubbabel (<reflink target="XXX">Ezra 3:7</reflink>).</description>
    <description>Of the ancient cedars of Lebanon there remain now only some seven or eight. They are not standing together. But beside them there are found between three hundred and four hundred of younger growth. They stand in an amphitheatre fronting the west, about 6,400 feet above the level of the sea.</description>
    <description>The cedar is often figuratively alluded to in the sacred Scriptures. "The mighty conquerors of olden days, the despots of Assyria and the Pharaohs of Egypt, the proud and idolatrous monarchs of Judah, the Hebrew commonwealth itself, the war-like Ammonites of patriarchal times, and the moral majesty of the Messianic age, are all compared to the towering cedar, in its royal loftiness and supremacy (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 2:13; Ezek. 17:3, 22, 23, 31:3-9; Amos 2:9; Zech. 11:1, 2; Job 40:17; Ps. 29:5; 80:10; 92:12, etc</reflink>).", Groser's Scrip.

  </item>
  <item id="Censer">
    <description>the vessel in which incense was presented on "the golden altar" before the Lord in the temple (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 30:1-9</reflink>). The priest filled the censer with live coal from the sacred fire on the altar of burnt-offering, and having carried it into the sanctuary, there threw upon the burning coals the sweet incense (<reflink target="XXX">Lev. 16:12, 13</reflink>), which sent up a cloud of smoke, filling the apartment with fragrance. The censers in daily use were of brass (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 16:39</reflink>), and were designated by a different Hebrew name, _miktereth_ (<reflink target="XXX">2 Chr. 26:19; Ezek. 8:11</reflink>): while those used on the day of Atonement were of gold, and were denoted by a word (mahtah) meaning "something to take fire with;" LXX. pureion = a fire-pan. Solomon prepared for the temple censers of pure gold (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 7:50; 2 Chr. 4:22</reflink>). The angel in the Apocalypse is represented with a golden censer (<reflink target="XXX">Rev. 8:3, 5</reflink>). Paul speaks of the golden censer as belonging to the tabernacle (<reflink target="XXX">Heb. 9:4</reflink>). The Greek word thumiaterion, here rendered "censer," may more appropriately denote, as in the margin of Revised Version, "the altar of incense." Paul does not here say that the thumiaterion was in the holiest, for it was in the holy place, but that the holiest had it, i.e., that it belonged to the holiest (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 6:22</reflink>). It was intimately connected with the high priest's service in the holiest.</description>
    <description>The manner in which the censer is to be used is described in Num. 4:14; Lev. 16:12.</description>

  <item id="Census">
    <description>There are five instances of a census of the Jewish people having been taken. (1.) In the fourth month after the Exodus, when the people were encamped at Sinai. The number of men from twenty years old and upward was then 603,550 (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 38:26</reflink>). (2.) Another census was made just before the entrance into Canaan, when the number was found to be 601,730, showing thus a small decrease (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 26:51</reflink>). (3.) The next census was in the time of David, when the number, exclusive of the tribes of Levi and Benjamin, was found to be 1,300,000 (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 24:9; 1 Chr. 21:5</reflink>). (4.) Solomon made a census of the foreigners in the land, and found 153,600 able-bodied workmen (<reflink target="XXX">2 Chr. 2:17, 18</reflink>). (5.) After the return from Exile the whole congregation of Israel was numbered, and found to amount to 42,360 (<reflink target="XXX">Ezra 2:64</reflink>).

  <item id="Centurion">
    <description>a Roman officer in command of a hundred men (<reflink target="XXX">Mark 15:39, 44, 45</reflink>). Cornelius, the first Gentile convert, was a centurion (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 10:1, 22</reflink>). Other centurions are mentioned in Matt. 8:5, 8, 13; Luke 7:2, 6; Acts 21:32; 22:25, 26; 23:17, 23; 24:23; 27:1, 6, 11, 31, 43; 28:16. A centurion watched the crucifixion of our Lord (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 27:54; Luke 23:47</reflink>), and when he saw the wonders attending it, exclaimed, "Truly this man was the Son of God." "The centurions mentioned in the New Testament are uniformly spoken of in terms of praise, whether in the Gospels or in the Acts. It is interesting to compare this with the statement of Polybius (vi. 24), that the centurions were chosen by merit, and so were men remarkable not so much for their daring courage as for their deliberation, constancy, and strength of mind.", Dr. Maclear's N.

This word sometimes, however, means dried grass or hay (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 5:24; 33:11</reflink>). Chaff is used as a figure of abortive wickedness (<reflink target="XXX">Ps. 1:4; Matt. 3:12</reflink>). False doctrines are also called chaff (<reflink target="XXX">Jer. 23:28</reflink>), or more correctly rendered "chopped straw."

  <item id="Chain">
    <description>(1.) A part of the insignia of office. A chain of gold was placed about Joseph's neck (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 41:42</reflink>); and one was promised to Daniel (5:7). It is used as a symbol of sovereignty (<reflink target="XXX">Ezek. 16:11</reflink>). The breast-plate of the high-priest was fastened to the ephod by golden chains (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 39:17, 21</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(2.) It was used as an ornament (<reflink target="XXX">Prov. 1:9; Cant. 1:10</reflink>). The Midianites adorned the necks of their camels with chains (<reflink target="XXX">Judg. 8:21, 26</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(3.) Chains were also used as fetters wherewith prisoners were bound (<reflink target="XXX">Judg. 16:21; 2 Sam. 3:34; 2 Kings 25:7; Jer. 39:7</reflink>). Paul was in this manner bound to a Roman soldier (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 28:20; Eph. 6:20; 2 Tim. 1:16</reflink>). Sometimes, for the sake of greater security, the prisoner was attached by two chains to two soldiers, as in the case of Peter (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 12:6</reflink>).</description>

  <item id="Chalcedony">
    <description>Mentioned only in Rev. 21:19, as one of the precious stones in the foundation of the New Jerusalem. The name of this stone is derived from Chalcedon, where it is said to have been first discovered. In modern mineralogy this is the name of an agate-like quartz of a bluish colour. Pliny so names the Indian ruby. The mineral intended in Revelation is probably the Hebrew _nophekh_, translated "emerald" (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 28:18; 39:11; Ezek. 27:16; 28:13</reflink>). It is rendered "anthrax" in the LXX., and "carbunculus" in the Vulgate. (<see target="x-self">See CARBUNCLE.</see>)</description>

  <item id="Chaldea">
    <description>The southern portion of Babylonia, Lower Mesopotamia, lying chiefly on the right bank of the Euphrates, but commonly used of the whole of the Mesopotamian plain. The Hebrew name is Kasdim, which is usually rendered "Chaldeans" (<reflink target="XXX">Jer. 50:10; 51:24,35</reflink>).</description>
    <description>The country so named is a vast plain formed by the deposits of the Euphrates and the Tigris, extending to about 400 miles along the course of these rivers, and about 100 miles in average breadth. "In former days the vast plains of Babylon were nourished by a complicated system of canals and water-courses, which spread over the surface of the country like a network. The wants of a teeming population were supplied by a rich soil, not less bountiful than that on the banks of the Egyptian Nile. Like islands rising from a golden sea of waving corn stood frequent groves of palm-trees and pleasant gardens, affording to the idler or traveller their grateful and highly-valued shade. Crowds of passengers hurried along the dusty roads to and from the busy city. The land was rich in corn and wine."</description>
    <description>Recent discoveries, more especially in Babylonia, have thrown much light on the history of the Hebrew patriarchs, and have illustrated or confirmed the Biblical narrative in many points. The ancestor of the Hebrew people, Abram, was, we are told, born at "Ur of the Chaldees." "Chaldees" is a mistranslation of the Hebrew _Kasdim_, Kasdim being the Old Testament name of the Babylonians, while the Chaldees were a tribe who lived on the shores of the Persian Gulf, and did not become a part of the Babylonian population till the time of Hezekiah. Ur was one of the oldest and most famous of the Babylonian cities. Its site is now called Mugheir, or Mugayyar, on the western bank of the Euphrates, in Southern Babylonia. About a century before the birth of Abram it was ruled by a powerful dynasty of kings. Their conquests extended to Elam on the one side, and to the Lebanon on the other. They were followed by a dynasty of princes whose capital was Babylon, and who seem to have been of South Arabian origin. The founder of the dynasty was Sumu-abi ("Shem is my father"). But soon afterwards Babylonia fell under Elamite dominion. The kings of Babylon were compelled to acknowledge the supremacy of Elam, and a rival kingdom to that of Babylon, and governed by Elamites, sprang up at Larsa, not far from Ur, but on the opposite bank of the river. In the time of Abram the king of Larsa was Eri-Aku, the son of an Elamite prince, and Eri-Aku, as has long been recognized, is the Biblical "Arioch king of Ellasar" (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 14:1</reflink>). The contemporaneous king of Babylon in the north, in the country termed Shinar in Scripture, was Khammu-rabi. (See BABYLON; ABRAHAM; AMRAPHEL</description>

It was the language of commerce and of social intercourse in Western Asia, and after the Exile gradually came to be the popular language of Palestine. It is called "Syrian" in 2 Kings 18:26. Some isolated words in this language are preserved in the New Testament (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 5:22; 6:24; 16:17; 27:46; Mark 3:17; 5:41; 7:34; 14:36; Acts 1:19; 1 Cor. 16:22</reflink>). These are specimens of the vernacular language of Palestine at that period. The term "Hebrew" was also sometimes applied to the Chaldee because it had become the language of the Hebrews (<reflink target="XXX">John 5:2; 19:20</reflink>).</description>

  <item id="Chaldees">
    <description>or Chaldeans, the inhabitants of the country of which Babylon was the capital. They were so called till the time of the Captivity (2 Kings 25; Isa. 13:19; 23:13), when, particularly in the Book of Daniel (5:30; 9:1), the name began to be used with special reference to a class of learned men ranked with the magicians and astronomers. These men cultivated the ancient Cushite language of the original inhabitants of the land, for they had a "learning" and a "tongue" (1:4) of their own. The common language of the country at that time had become assimilated to the Semitic dialect, especially through the influence of the Assyrians, and was the language that was used for all civil purposes. The Chaldeans were the learned class, interesting themselves in science and religion, which consisted, like that of the ancient Arabians and Syrians, in the worship of the heavenly bodies. There are representations of this priestly class, of magi and diviners, on the walls of the Assyrian palaces.</description>

  <item id="Chamber">
    <description>"on the wall," which the Shunammite prepared for the prophet Elisha (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 4:10</reflink>), was an upper chamber over the porch through the hall toward the street. This was the "guest chamber" where entertainments were prepared (<reflink target="XXX">Mark 14:14</reflink>). There were also "chambers within chambers" (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 22:25; 2 Kings 9:2</reflink>). To enter into a chamber is used metaphorically of prayer and communion with God (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 26:20</reflink>). The "chambers of the south" (<reflink target="XXX">Job 9:9</reflink>) are probably the constelations of the southern hemisphere. The "chambers of imagery", i.e., chambers painted with images, as used by Ezekiel (8:12), is an expression denoting the vision the prophet had of the abominations practised by the Jews in Jerusalem.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Chambering">
    <description>(<reflink target="XXX">Rom. 13:13</reflink>), wantonness, impurity.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Chamberlain">
    <description>a confidential servant of the king (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 37:36; 39:1</reflink>). In Rom. 16:23 mention is made of "Erastus the chamberlain." Here the word denotes the treasurer of the city, or the quaestor, as the Romans styled him. He is almost the only convert from the higher ranks of whom mention is made (<reflink target="XXX">comp. Acts 17:34</reflink>). Blastus, Herod's "chamberlain" (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 12:20</reflink>), was his personal attendant or valet-de-chambre. The Hebrew word _saris_, thus translated in Esther 1:10, 15; 2:3, 14, 21, etc., properly means an eunuch (as in the marg.), as it is rendered in Isa. 39:7; 56:3.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Chameleon">
    <description>a species of lizard which has the faculty of changing the colour of its skin. It is ranked among the unclean animals in Lev. 11:30, where the Hebrew word so translated is _coah_ (R.V., "land crocodile"). In the same verse the Hebrew _tanshemeth_, rendered in Authorized Version "mole," is in Revised Version "chameleon," which is the correct rendering. This animal is very common in Egypt and in the Holy Land, especially in the Jordan valley.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Chamois">
    <description>only in Deut. 14:5 (Heb. zemer), an animal of the deer or gazelle species. It bears this Hebrew name from its leaping or springing. The animal intended is probably the wild sheep (Ovis tragelephus), which is still found in Sinai and in the broken ridges of Stony Arabia. The LXX. and Vulgate render the word by camelopardus, i.e., the giraffe; but this is an animal of Central Africa, and is not at all known in Syria.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Champion">
    <description>(<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 17:4, 23</reflink>), properly "the man between the two," denoting the position of Goliath between the two camps. Single combats of this kind at the head of armies were common in ancient times. In ver. 51 this word is the rendering of a different Hebrew word, and properly denotes "a mighty man."</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Chance">
    <description>(<reflink target="XXX">Luke 10:31</reflink>). "It was not by chance that the priest came down by that road at that time, but by a specific arrangement and in exact fulfilment of a plan; not the plan of the priest, nor the plan of the wounded traveller, but the plan of God. By coincidence (Gr. sungkuria) the priest came down, that is, by the conjunction of two things, in fact, which were previously constituted a pair in the providence of God. In the result they fell together according to the omniscient Designer's plan. This is the true theory of the divine government." Compare the meeting of Philip with the Ethiopian (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 8:26, 27</reflink>). There is no "chance" in God's empire. "Chance" is only another word for our want of knowledge as to the way in which one event falls in with another (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 6:9; Eccl. 9:11</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Chancellor">
    <description>one who has judicial authority, literally, a "lord of judgement;" a title given to the Persian governor of Samaria (<reflink target="XXX">Ezra 4:8, 9, 17</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Changes of raiment">
    <description>were reckoned among the treasures of rich men (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 45:22; Judg. 14:12, 13; 2 Kings 5:22, 23</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Channel">
    <description>(1.) The bed of the sea or of a river (<reflink target="XXX">Ps. 18:15; Isa. 8:7</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(2.) The "chanelbone" (<reflink target="XXX">Job 31:22 marg.</reflink>), properly "tube" or "shaft," an old term for the collar-bone.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Chapel">
    <description>a holy place or sanctuary, occurs only in Amos 7:13, where one of the idol priests calls Bethel "the king's chapel."</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Chapiter">
    <description>the ornamental head or capital of a pillar. Three Hebrew words are so rendered. (1.) _Cothereth_ (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 7:16; 2 Kings 25:17; 2 Chr. 4:12</reflink>), meaning a "diadem" or "crown." (2.) _Tzepheth_ (<reflink target="XXX">2 Chr. 3:15</reflink>). (3.) _Rosh_ (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 36:38; 38:17, 19, 28</reflink>), properly a "head" or "top."</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Chapter">
    <description>The several books of the Old and New Testaments were from an early time divided into chapters. The Pentateuch was divided by the ancient Hebrews into 54 _parshioth_ or sections, one of which was read in the synagogue every Sabbath day (<reflink target="XXX">Acts. 13:15</reflink>). These sections were afterwards divided into 669 _sidrim_ or orders of unequal length. The Prophets were divided in somewhat the same manner into _haphtaroth_ or passages.</description>
    <description>In the early Latin and Greek versions of the Bible, similar divisions of the several books were made. The New Testament books were also divided into portions of various lengths under different names, such as titles and heads or chapters.</description>
    <description>In modern times this ancient example was imitated, and many attempts of the kind were made before the existing division into chapters was fixed. The Latin Bible published by Cardinal Hugo of St. Cher in A.D. 1240 is generally regarded as the first Bible that was divided into our present chapters, although it appears that some of the chapters were fixed as early as A.D. 1059. This division into chapters came gradually to be adopted in the published editions of the Hebrew, with some few variations, and of the Greek Scriptures, and hence of other versions.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Charashim">
    <description>craftsmen, a valley named in 1 Chr. 4:14. In Neh. 11:35 the Hebrew word is rendered "valley of craftsmen" (R.V. marg., Geha-rashim). Nothing is known of it.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Charger">
    <description>a bowl or deep dish. The silver vessels given by the heads of the tribes for the services of the tabernacle are so named (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 7:13, etc.</reflink>). The "charger" in which the Baptist's head was presented was a platter or flat wooden trencher (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 14:8, 11; Mark 6:25, 28</reflink>). The chargers of gold and silver of Ezra 1:9 were probably basins for receiving the blood of sacrifices.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Chariot">
    <description>a vehicle generally used for warlike purposes. Sometimes, though but rarely, it is spoken of as used for peaceful purposes.</description>
    <description>The first mention of the chariot is when Joseph, as a mark of distinction, was placed in Pharaoh's second state chariot (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 41:43</reflink>); and the next, when he went out in his own chariot to meet his father Jacob (46:29). Chariots formed part of the funeral procession of Jacob (50:9). When Pharaoh pursued the Israelites he took 600 war-chariots with him (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 14:7</reflink>). The Canaanites in the valleys of Palestine had chariots of iron (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 17:18; Judg. 1:19</reflink>). Jabin, the king of Canaan, had 900 chariots (<reflink target="XXX">Judg. 4:3</reflink>); and in Saul's time the Philistines had 30,000. In his wars with the king of Zobah and with the Syrians, David took many chariots among the spoils (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 8:4; 10:18</reflink>). Solomon maintained as part of his army 1,400 chariots (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 10:26</reflink>), which were chiefly imported from Egypt (29). From this time forward they formed part of the armies of Israel (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 22:34; 2 Kings 9:16, 21; 13:7, 14; 18:24; 23:30</reflink>).</description>
    <description>In the New Testament we have only one historical reference to the use of chariots, in the case of the Ethiopian eunuch (<reflink target="XXX">Acts. 8:28, 29, 38</reflink>).</description>
    <description>This word is sometimes used figuratively for hosts (<reflink target="XXX">Ps. 68:17; 2 Kings 6:17</reflink>). Elijah, by his prayers and his counsel, was "the chariot of Israel, and the horsemen thereof." The rapid agency of God in the phenomena of nature is also spoken of under the similitude of a chariot (<reflink target="XXX">Ps. 104:3; Isa. 66:15; Hab. 3:8</reflink>).</description>
    <description>Chariot of the cherubim (<reflink target="XXX">1 Chr. 28:18</reflink>), the chariot formed by the two cherubs on the mercy-seat on which the Lord rides.</description>
    <description>Chariot cities were set apart for storing the war-chariots in time of peace (<reflink target="XXX">2 Chr. 1:14</reflink>).</description>
    <description>Chariot horses were such as were peculiarly fitted for service in chariots (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 7:14</reflink>).</description>
    <description>Chariots of war are described in Ex. 14:7; 1 Sam. 13:5; 2 Sam. 8:4; 1 Chr. 18:4; Josh. 11:4; Judg. 4:3, 13. They were not used by the Israelites till the time of David. Elijah was translated in a "chariot of fire" (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 2:11</reflink>). Comp. 2 Kings 6:17. This vision would be to Elisha a source of strength and encouragement, for now he could say, "They that be with us are more than they that be with them."</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Charity">
    <description>(1 Cor. 13), the rendering in the Authorized Version of the word which properly denotes love, and is frequently so rendered (always so in the Revised Version). It is spoken of as the greatest of the three Christian graces (<reflink target="XXX">1 Cor. 12:31-13:13</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Charmer">
    <description>one who practises serpent-charming (<reflink target="XXX">Ps. 58:5; Jer. 8:17; Eccl. 10:11</reflink>). It was an early and universal opinion that the most venomous reptiles could be made harmless by certain charms or by sweet sounds. It is well known that there are jugglers in India and in other Eastern lands who practise this art at the present day.</description>
    <description>In Isa. 19:3 the word "charmers" is the rendering of the Hebrew _'ittim_, meaning, properly, necromancers (R.V. marg., "whisperers"). In Deut. 18:11 the word "charmer" means a dealer in spells, especially one who, by binding certain knots, was supposed thereby to bind a curse or a blessing on its object. In Isa. 3:3 the words "eloquent orator" should be, as in the Revised Version, "skilful enchanter."</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Charran">
    <description>another form (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 7:2, 4</reflink>) of Haran (q.v.).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Chebar">
    <description>length, a river in the "land of the Chaldeans" (<reflink target="XXX">Ezek. 1:3</reflink>), on the banks of which were located some of the Jews of the Captivity (<reflink target="XXX">Ezek. 1:1; 3:15, 23; 10:15, 20, 22</reflink>). It has been supposed to be identical with the river Habor, the Chaboras, or modern Khabour, which falls into the Euphrates at Circesium. To the banks of this river some of the Israelites were removed by the Assyrians (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 17:6</reflink>). An opinion that has much to support it is that the "Chebar" was the royal canal of Nebuchadnezzar, the Nahr Malcha, the greatest in Mesopotamia, which connected the Tigris with the Euphrates, in the excavation of which the Jewish captives were probably employed.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Chedorlaomer">
    <description>(= Khudur-Lagamar of the inscriptions), king of Elam. Many centuries before the age of Abraham, Canaan and even the Sinaitic peninsula had been conquered by Babylonian kings, and in the time of Abraham himself Babylonia was ruled by a dynasty which claimed sovereignity over Syria and Palestine. The kings of the dynasty bore names which were not Babylonian, but at once South Arabic and Hebrew. The most famous king of the dynasty was Khammu-rabi, who united Babylonia under one rule, and made Babylon its capital. When he ascended the throne, the country was under the suzerainty of the Elamites, and was divided into two kingdoms, that of Babylon (the Biblical Shinar) and that of Larsa (the Biblical Ellasar). The king of Larsa was Eri-Aku ("the servant of the moon-god"), the son of an Elamite prince, Kudur-Mabug, who is entitled "the father of the land of the Amorites." A recently discovered tablet enumerates among the enemies of Khammu-rabi, Kudur-Lagamar ("the servant of the goddess Lagamar") or Chedorlaomer, Eri-Aku or Arioch, and Tudkhula or Tidal. Khammu-rabi, whose name is also read Ammi-rapaltu or Amraphel by some scholars, succeeded in overcoming Eri-Aku and driving the Elamites out of Babylonia. Assur-bani-pal, the last of the Assyrian conquerors, mentions in two inscriptions that he took Susa 1635 years after Kedor-nakhunta, king of Elam, had conquered Babylonia. It was in the year B.C. 660 that Assur-bani-pal took Susa.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Cheek">
    <description>Smiting on the cheek was accounted a grievous injury and insult (<reflink target="XXX">Job 16:10; Lam. 3:30; Micah 5:1</reflink>). The admonition (<reflink target="XXX">Luke 6:29</reflink>), "Unto him that smiteth thee on the one cheek offer also the other," means simply, "Resist not evil" (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 5:39; 1 Pet. 2:19-23</reflink>). Ps. 3:7 = that God had deprived his enemies of the power of doing him injury.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Cheese">
    <description>(A.S. cese). This word occurs three times in the Authorized Version as the translation of three different Hebrew words: (1.) 1 Sam. 17:18, "ten cheeses;" i.e., ten sections of curd. (2.) 2 Sam. 17:29, "cheese of kine" = perhaps curdled milk of kine. The Vulgate version reads "fat calves." (3.) Job 10:10, curdled milk is meant by the word.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Chemarim">
    <description>black, (<reflink target="XXX">Zeph. 1:4; rendered "idolatrous priests" in 2 Kings 23:5, and "priests" in Hos. 10:5</reflink>). Some derive this word from the Assyrian Kamaru, meaning "to throw down," and interpret it as describing the idolatrous priests who prostrate themselves before the idols. Others regard it as meaning "those who go about in black," or "ascetics."</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Chemosh">
    <description>the destroyer, subduer, or fish-god, the god of the Moabites (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 21:29; Jer. 48:7, 13, 46</reflink>). The worship of this god, "the abomination of Moab," was introduced at Jerusalem by Solomon (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 11:7</reflink>), but was abolished by Josiah (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 23:13</reflink>). On the "Moabite Stone" (q.v.), Mesha (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 3:5</reflink>) ascribes his victories over the king of Israel to this god, "And Chemosh drove him before my sight."</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Chenaanah">
    <description>merchant. (1.) A Benjamite (<reflink target="XXX">1 Chr. 7:10</reflink>). (2.) The father of Zedekiah (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 22:11, 24</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Chenaiah">
    <description>whom Jehovah hath made. "Chief of the Levites," probably a Kohathite (<reflink target="XXX">1 Chr. 15:22</reflink>), and therefore not the same as mentioned in 26:29.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Chephirah">
    <description>village, one of the four cities of the Gibeonitish Hivites with whom Joshua made a league (9:17). It belonged to Benjamin. It has been identified with the modern Kefireh, on the west confines of Benjamin, about 2 miles west of Ajalon and 11 from Jerusalem.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Cherethim">
    <description>(<reflink target="XXX">Ezek. 25:16</reflink>), more frequently Cherethites, the inhabitants of Southern Philistia, the Philistines (<reflink target="XXX">Zeph. 2:5</reflink>). The Cherethites and the Pelethites were David's life-guards (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 30:14; 2 Sam. 8:18; 20:7, 23; 23:23</reflink>). This name is by some interpreted as meaning "Cretans," and by others "executioners," who were ready to execute the king's sentence of death (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 37:36, marg.; 1 Kings 2:25</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Cherith">
    <description>a cutting; separation; a gorge, a torrent-bed or winter-stream, a "brook," in whose banks the prophet Elijah hid himself during the early part of the three years' drought (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 17:3, 5</reflink>). It has by some been identified as the Wady el-Kelt behind Jericho, which is formed by the junction of many streams flowing from the mountains west of Jericho. It is dry in summer. Travellers have described it as one of the wildest ravines of this wild region, and peculiarly fitted to afford a secure asylum to the persecuted. But if the prophet's interview with Ahab was in Samaria, and he thence journeyed toward the east, it is probable that he crossed Jordan and found refuge in some of the ravines of Gilead. The "brook" is said to have been "before Jordan," which probably means that it opened toward that river, into which it flowed. This description would apply to the east as well as to the west of Jordan. Thus Elijah's hiding-place may have been the Jermuk, in the territory of the half-tribe of Manasseh.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Cherub">
    <description>plural cherubim, the name of certain symbolical figures frequently mentioned in Scripture. They are first mentioned in connection with the expulsion of our first parents from Eden (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 3:24</reflink>). There is no intimation given of their shape or form. They are next mentioned when Moses was commanded to provide furniture for the tabernacle (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 25:17-20; 26:1, 31</reflink>). God promised to commune with Moses "from between the cherubim" (25:22). This expression was afterwards used to denote the Divine abode and presence (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 7:89; 1 Sam. 4:4; Isa. 37:16; Ps. 80:1; 99:1</reflink>). In Ezekiel's vision (10:1-20) they appear as living creatures supporting the throne of God. From Ezekiel's description of them (1;10; 41:18, 19), they appear to have been compound figures, unlike any real object in nature; artificial images possessing the features and properties of several animals. Two cherubim were placed on the mercy-seat of the ark; two of colossal size overshadowed it in Solomon's temple. Ezekiel (1:4-14) speaks of four; and this number of "living creatures" is mentioned in Rev. 4:6. Those on the ark are called the "cherubim of glory" (<reflink target="XXX">Heb. 9:5</reflink>), i.e., of the Shechinah, or cloud of glory, for on them the visible glory of God rested. They were placed one at each end of the mercy-seat, with wings stretched upward, and their faces "toward each other and toward the mercy-seat." They were anointed with holy oil, like the ark itself and the other sacred furniture.</description>
    <description>The cherubim were symbolical. They were intended to represent spiritual existences in immediate contact with Jehovah. Some have regarded them as symbolical of the chief ruling power by which God carries on his operations in providence (<reflink target="XXX">Ps. 18:10</reflink>). Others interpret them as having reference to the redemption of men, and as symbolizing the great rulers or ministers of the church. Many other opinions have been held regarding them which need not be referred to here. On the whole, it seems to be most satisfactory to regard the interpretation of the symbol to be variable, as is the symbol itself.</description>
    <description>Their office was, (1) on the expulsion of our first parents from Eden, to prevent all access to the tree of life; and (2) to form the throne and chariot of Jehovah in his manifestation of himself on earth. He dwelleth between and sitteth on the cherubim (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 4:4; Ps. 80:1; Ezek. 1:26, 28</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Chesalon">
    <description>strength; confidence, a place on the border of Judah, on the side of Mount Jearim (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 15:10</reflink>); probably identified with the modern village of Kesla, on the western mountains of Judah.</description>

  </item>
  <item id="Chest">
    <description>(Heb. _'aron_, generally rendered "ark"), the coffer into which the contributions for the repair of the temple were put (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 12:9, 10; 2 Chr. 24:8, 10, 11</reflink>). In Gen. 50:26 it is rendered "coffin." In Ezek. 27:24 a different Hebrew word, _genazim_ (plur.), is used. It there means "treasure-chests."</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Chestnut tree">
    <description>(Heb. _'armon_; i.e., "naked"), mentioned in connection with Jacob's artifice regarding the cattle (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 30:37</reflink>). It is one of the trees of which, because of its strength and beauty, the Assyrian empire is likened (<reflink target="XXX">Ezek. 31:8; R.V., "plane trees"</reflink>). It is probably the Oriental plane tree (Platanus orientalis) that is intended. It is a characteristic of this tree that it annually sheds its outer bark, becomes "naked." The chestnut tree proper is not a native of Palestine.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Chesulloth">
    <description>fertile places; the loins, a town of Issachar, on the slopes of some mountain between Jezreel and Shunem (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 19:18</reflink>). It has been identified with Chisloth-tabor, 2 1/2 miles to the west of Mount Tabor, and north of Jezreel; now Iksal.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Chezib">

  </item>
  <item id="Chidon">
    <description>dart, the name of the threshing-floor at which the death of Uzzah took place (<reflink target="XXX">1 Chr. 13:9</reflink>). In the parallel passage in Samuel (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 6:6</reflink>) it is called "Nachon's threshing-floor." It was a place not far north-west from Jerusalem.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Chief of the three">
    <description>a title given to Adino the Eznite, one of David's greatest heroes (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 23:8</reflink>); also called Jashobeam (<reflink target="XXX">1 Chr. 11:11</reflink>).</description>

    <description>"Asiarchs," the title given to certain wealthy persons annually appointed to preside over the religious festivals and games in the various cities of proconsular Asia (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 19:31</reflink>). Some of these officials appear to have been Paul's friends.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Child">
    <description>This word has considerable latitude of meaning in Scripture. Thus Joseph is called a child at the time when he was probably about sixteen years of age (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 37:3</reflink>); and Benjamin is so called when he was above thirty years (44:20). Solomon called himself a little child when he came to the kingdom (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 3:7</reflink>).</description>
    <description>The descendants of a man, however remote, are called his children; as, "the children of Edom," "the children of Moab," "the children of Israel."</description>
    <description>In the earliest times mothers did not wean their children till they were from thirty months to three years old; and the day on which they were weaned was kept as a festival day (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 21:8; Ex. 2:7, 9; 1 Sam. 1:22-24; Matt. 21:16</reflink>). At the age of five, children began to learn the arts and duties of life under the care of their fathers (<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 6:20-25; 11:19</reflink>).</description>
    <description>To have a numerous family was regarded as a mark of divine favour (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 11:30; 30:1; 1 Sam. 2:5; 2 Sam. 6:23; Ps. 127:3; 128:3</reflink>).</description>
    <description>Figuratively the name is used for those who are ignorant or narrow-minded (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 11:16; Luke 7:32; 1 Cor. 13:11</reflink>). "When I was a child, I spake as a child." "Brethren, be not children in understanding" (<reflink target="XXX">1 Cor. 14:20</reflink>). "That we henceforth be no more children, tossed to and fro" (<reflink target="XXX">Eph. 4:14</reflink>).</description>
    <description>Children are also spoken of as representing simplicity and humility (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 19:13-15; Mark 10:13-16; Luke 18:15-17</reflink>). Believers are "children of light" (<reflink target="XXX">Luke 16:8; 1 Thess. 5:5</reflink>) and "children of obedience" (<reflink target="XXX">1 Pet. 1:14</reflink>).</description>

  <item id="Chimham">
    <description>pining, probably the youngest son of Barzillai the Gileadite (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 19:37-40</reflink>). The "habitation of Chimham" (<reflink target="XXX">Jer. 41:17</reflink>) was probably an inn or khan, which is the proper meaning of the Hebrew _geruth_, rendered "habitation", established in later times in his possession at Bethlehem, which David gave to him as a reward for his loyalty in accompanying him to Jerusalem after the defeat of Absalom (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 2:7</reflink>). It has been supposed that, considering the stationary character of Eastern institutions, it was in the stable of this inn or caravanserai that our Saviour was born (<reflink target="XXX">Luke 2:7</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Chinnereth">
    <description>lyre, the singular form of the word (<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 3:17; Josh. 19:35</reflink>), which is also used in the plural form, Chinneroth, the name of a fenced city which stood near the shore of the lake of Galilee, a little to the south of Tiberias. The town seems to have given its name to a district, as appears from 1 Kings 15:20, where the plural form of the word is used.</description>
    <description>The Sea of Chinnereth (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 34:11; Josh. 13:27</reflink>), or of Chinneroth (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 12: 3</reflink>), was the "lake of Gennesaret" or "sea of Tiberias" (<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 3:17; Josh. 11:2</reflink>). Chinnereth was probably an ancient Canaanitish name adopted by the Israelites into their language.</description>

  <item id="Chios">
    <description>mentioned in Acts 20:15, an island in the Aegean Sea, about 5 miles distant from the mainland, having a roadstead, in the shelter of which Paul and his companions anchored for a night when on his third missionary return journey. It is now called Scio.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Chisleu">
    <description>the name adopted from the Babylonians by the Jews after the Captivity for the third civil, or ninth ecclesiastical, month (<reflink target="XXX">Neh. 1:1; Zech. 7:1</reflink>). It corresponds nearly with the moon in November.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Chittim">
    <description>or Kittim, a plural form (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 10:4</reflink>), the name of a branch of the descendants of Javan, the "son" of Japheth. Balaam foretold (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 24:24</reflink>) "that ships shall come from the coast of Chittim, and afflict Eber." Daniel prophesied (11:30) that the ships of Chittim would come against the king of the north. It probably denotes Cyprus, whose ancient capital was called Kition by the Greeks.</description>
    <description>The references elsewhere made to Chittim (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 23:1, 12; Jer. 2:10; Ezek. 27:6</reflink>) are to be explained on the ground that while the name originally designated the Phoenicians only, it came latterly to be used of all the islands and various settlements on the sea-coasts which they had occupied, and then of the people who succeeded them when the Phoenician power decayed. Hence it designates generally the islands and coasts of the Mediterranean and the races that inhabit them.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Chiun">
    <description>occurs only in Amos 5:26 (R.V. marg., "shrine"). The LXX. translated the word by Rhephan, which became corrupted into Remphan, as used by Stephen (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 7:43; but R.V., "Rephan"</reflink>). Probably the planet Saturn is intended by the name. Astrologers represented this planet as baleful in its influences, and hence the Phoenicians offered to it human sacrifices, especially children.</description>

  <item id="Chor-ashan">
    <description>smoking furnace, one of the places where "David himself and his men were wont to haunt" (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 30:30, 31</reflink>). It is probably identical with Ashan (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 15:42; 19:7</reflink>), a Simeonite city in the Negeb, i.e., the south, belonging to Judah. The word ought, according to another reading, to be "Bor-ashan."</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Chorazin">
    <description>named along with Bethsaida and Capernaum as one of the cities in which our Lord's "mighty works" were done, and which was doomed to woe because of signal privileges neglected (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 11:21; Luke 10:13</reflink>). It has been identified by general consent with the modern Kerazeh, about 2 1/2 miles up the Wady Kerazeh from Capernaum; i.e., Tell Hum.</description>

Christ is the "chosen" of God (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 42:1</reflink>); and the apostles are "chosen" for their work (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 10:41</reflink>). It is said with regard to those who do not profit by their opportunities that "many are called, but few are chosen" (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 20:16</reflink>).

  </item>
  <item id="Christ">
    <description>anointed, the Greek translation of the Hebrew word rendered "Messiah" (q.v.), the official title of our Lord, occurring five hundred and fourteen times in the New Testament. It denotes that he was anointed or consecrated to his great redemptive work as Prophet, Priest, and King of his people. He is Jesus the Christ (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 17:3; 18:5; Matt. 22:42</reflink>), the Anointed One. He is thus spoken of by Isaiah (61:1), and by Daniel (9:24-26), who styles him "Messiah the Prince."</description>
    <description>The Messiah is the same person as "the seed of the woman" (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 3:15</reflink>), "the seed of Abraham" (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 22:18</reflink>), the "Prophet like unto Moses" (<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 18:15</reflink>), "the priest after the order of Melchizedek" (<reflink target="XXX">Ps. 110:4</reflink>), "the rod out of the stem of Jesse" (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 11:1, 10</reflink>), the "Immanuel," the virgin's son (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 7:14</reflink>), "the branch of Jehovah" (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 4:2</reflink>), and "the messenger of the covenant" (<reflink target="XXX">Mal. 3:1</reflink>). This is he "of whom Moses in the law and the prophets did write." The Old Testament Scripture is full of prophetic declarations regarding the Great Deliverer and the work he was to accomplish. Jesus the Christ is Jesus the Great Deliverer, the Anointed One, the Saviour of men. This name denotes that Jesus was divinely appointed, commissioned, and accredited as the Saviour of men (<reflink target="XXX">Heb. 5:4; Isa. 11:2-4; 49:6; John 5:37; Acts 2:22</reflink>).</description>
    <description>To believe that "Jesus is the Christ" is to believe that he is the Anointed, the Messiah of the prophets, the Saviour sent of God, that he was, in a word, what he claimed to be. This is to believe the gospel, by the faith of which alone men can be brought unto God. That Jesus is the Christ is the testimony of God, and the faith of this constitutes a Christian (<reflink target="XXX">1 Cor. 12:3; 1 John 5:1</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Christian">
    <description>the name given by the Greeks or Romans, probably in reproach, to the followers of Jesus. It was first used at Antioch. The names by which the disciples were known among themselves were "brethren," "the faithful," "elect," "saints," "believers." But as distinguishing them from the multitude without, the name "Christian" came into use, and was universally accepted. This name occurs but three times in the New Testament (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 11:26; 26:28; 1 Pet. 4:16</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Christs, False">

  </item>
  <item id="Chronicles of king David">
    <description>(<reflink target="XXX">1 Chr. 27:24</reflink>) were statistical state records; one of the public sources from which the compiler of the Books of Chronicles derived information on various public matters.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Chronicles, Books of">
    <description>The two books were originally one. They bore the title in the Massoretic Hebrew _Dibre hayyamim_, i.e., "Acts of the Days." This title was rendered by Jerome in his Latin version "Chronicon," and hence "Chronicles." In the Septuagint version the book is divided into two, and bears the title Paraleipomena, i.e., "things omitted," or "supplements", because containing many things omitted in the Books of Kings.</description>
    <description>The contents of these books are comprehended under four heads. (1.) The first nine chapters of Book I. contain little more than a list of genealogies in the line of Israel down to the time of David. (2.) The remainder of the first book contains a history of the reign of David. (3.) The first nine chapters of Book II. contain the history of the reign of Solomon. (4.) The remaining chapters of the second book contain the history of the separate kingdom of Judah to the time of the return from Babylonian Exile.</description>
    <description>The time of the composition of the Chronicles was, there is every ground to conclude, subsequent to the Babylonian Exile, probably between 450 and 435 B.C. The contents of this twofold book, both as to matter and form, correspond closely with this idea. The close of the book records the proclamation of Cyrus permitting the Jews to return to their own land, and this forms the opening passage of the Book of Ezra, which must be viewed as a continuation of the Chronicles. The peculiar form of the language, being Aramaean in its general character, harmonizes also with that of the books which were written after the Exile. The author was certainly contemporary with Zerubbabel, details of whose family history are given (<reflink target="XXX">1 Chr. 3:19</reflink>).</description>
    <description>The time of the composition being determined, the question of the authorship may be more easily decided. According to Jewish tradition, which was universally received down to the middle of the seventeenth century, Ezra was regarded as the author of the Chronicles. There are many points of resemblance and of contact between the Chronicles and the Book of Ezra which seem to confirm this opinion. The conclusion of the one and the beginning of the other are almost identical in expression. In their spirit and characteristics they are the same, showing thus also an identity of authorship.</description>
    <description>In their general scope and design these books are not so much historical as didactic. The principal aim of the writer appears to be to present moral and religious truth. He does not give prominence to political occurences, as is done in Samuel and Kings, but to ecclesiastical institutions. "The genealogies, so uninteresting to most modern readers, were really an important part of the public records of the Hebrew state. They were the basis on which not only the land was distributed and held, but the public services of the temple were arranged and conducted, the Levites and their descendants alone, as is well known, being entitled and first fruits set apart for that purpose." The "Chronicles" are an epitome of the sacred history from the days of Adam down to the return from Babylonian Exile, a period of about 3,500 years. The writer gathers up "the threads of the old national life broken by the Captivity."</description>
    <description>The sources whence the chronicler compiled his work were public records, registers, and genealogical tables belonging to the Jews. These are referred to in the course of the book (<reflink target="XXX">1 Chr. 27:24; 29:29; 2 Chr. 9:29; 12:15; 13:22; 20:34; 24:27; 26:22; 32:32; 33:18, 19; 27:7; 35:25</reflink>). There are in Chronicles, and the books of Samuel and Kings, forty parallels, often verbal, proving that the writer both knew and used these records (<reflink target="XXX">1 Chr. 17:18; comp. 2 Sam. 7:18-20; 1 Chr. 19; comp. 2 Sam. 10, etc.</reflink>).</description>
    <description>As compared with Samuel and Kings, the Book of Chronicles omits many particulars there recorded (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 6:20-23; 9; 11; 14-19, etc.</reflink>), and includes many things peculiar to itself (1 Chr. 12; 22; 23-26; 27; 28; 29, etc.). Twenty whole chapters, and twenty-four parts of chapters, are occupied with matter not found elsewhere. It also records many things in fuller detail, as (e.g.) the list of David's heroes (<reflink target="XXX">1 Chr. 12:1-37</reflink>), the removal of the ark from Kirjath-jearim to Mount Zion (1 Chr. 13; 15:2-24; 16:4-43; comp. 2 Sam. 6), Uzziah's leprosy and its cause (<reflink target="XXX">2 Chr. 26:16-21; comp. 2 Kings 15:5</reflink>), etc.</description>
    <description>It has also been observed that another peculiarity of the book is that it substitutes modern and more common expressions for those that had then become unusual or obsolete. This is seen particularly in the substitution of modern names of places, such as were in use in the writer's day, for the old names; thus Gezer (<reflink target="XXX">1 Chr. 20:4</reflink>) is used instead of Gob (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 21:18</reflink>), etc.</description>
    <description>The Books of Chronicles are ranked among the _khethubim_ or hagiographa. They are alluded to, though not directly quoted, in the New Testament (<reflink target="XXX">Heb. 5:4; Matt. 12:42; 23:35; Luke 1:5; 11:31, 51</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Chronology">
    <description>is the arrangement of facts and events in the order of time. The writers of the Bible themselves do not adopt any standard era according to which they date events. Sometimes the years are reckoned, e.g., from the time of the Exodus (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 1:1; 33:38; 1 Kings 6:1</reflink>), and sometimes from the accession of kings (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 15:1, 9, 25, 33, etc.</reflink>), and sometimes again from the return from Exile (<reflink target="XXX">Ezra 3:8</reflink>).</description>
    <description>Hence in constructing a system of Biblecal chronology, the plan has been adopted of reckoning the years from the ages of the patriarchs before the birth of their first-born sons for the period from the Creation to Abraham. After this period other data are to be taken into account in determining the relative sequence of events.</description>
    <description>As to the patriarchal period, there are three principal systems of chronology: (1) that of the Hebrew text, (2) that of the Septuagint version, and (3) that of the Samaritan Pentateuch, as seen in the scheme on the opposite page.</description>
    <description>The Samaritan and the Septuagint have considerably modified the Hebrew chronology. This modification some regard as having been wilfully made, and to be rejected. The same system of variations is observed in the chronology of the period between the Flood and Abraham. Thus:</description>
    <description>Hebrew Septuigant  Samaritan  From the birth of    Arphaxad, 2 years    after the Flood, to    the birth of Terah.     220      1000        870  From the birth of    Terah to the birth    of Abraham.             130        70         72</description>
    <description>The Septuagint fixes on seventy years as the age of Terah at the birth of Abraham, from Gen. 11:26; but a comparison of Gen. 11:32 and Acts 7:4 with Gen. 12:4 shows that when Terah died, at the age of two hundred and five years, Abraham was seventy-five years, and hence Terah must have been one hundred and thirty years when Abraham was born. Thus, including the two years from the Flood to the birth of Arphaxad, the period from the Flood to the birth of Abraham was three hundred and fifty-two years.</description>
    <description>The next period is from the birth of Abraham to the Exodus. This, according to the Hebrew, extends to five hundred and five years. The difficulty here is as to the four hundred and thirty years mentioned Ex. 12:40, 41; Gal. 3:17. These years are regarded by some as dating from the covenant with Abraham (Gen. 15), which was entered into soon after his sojourn in Egypt; others, with more probability, reckon these years from Jacob's going down into Egypt. (<see target="x-self">See EXODUS.</see>)</description>
    <description>In modern times the systems of Biblical chronology that have been adopted are chiefly those of Ussher and Hales. The former follows the Hebrew, and the latter the Septuagint mainly. Archbishop Ussher's (died 1656) system is called the short chronology. It is that given on the margin of the Authorized Version, but is really of no authority, and is quite uncertain.</description>
    <description>Ussher   Hales                           B.C.     B.C.  Creation                 4004     5411  Flood                    2348     3155  Abram leaves Haran       1921     2078  Exodus                   1491     1648  Destruction of the    Temple                  588      586</description>
    <description>To show at a glance the different ideas of the date of the creation, it may be interesting to note the following: From Creation to 1894.</description>
    <description>According to Ussher, 5,898; Hales, 7,305; Zunz (Hebrew reckoning), 5,882; Septuagint (Perowne), 7,305; Rabbinical, 5,654; Panodorus, 7,387; Anianus, 7,395; Constantinopolitan, 7,403; Eusebius, 7,093; Scaliger, 5,844; Dionysius (from whom we take our Christian era), 7,388; Maximus, 7,395; Syncellus and Theophanes, 7,395; Julius Africanus, 7,395; Jackson, 7,320.</description>

  </item>
  <item id="Church">
    <description>Derived probably from the Greek kuriakon (i.e., "the Lord's house"), which was used by ancient authors for the place of worship.</description>
    <description>In the New Testament it is the translation of the Greek word ecclesia, which is synonymous with the Hebrew _kahal_ of the Old Testament, both words meaning simply an assembly, the character of which can only be known from the connection in which the word is found. There is no clear instance of its being used for a place of meeting or of worship, although in post-apostolic times it early received this meaning. Nor is this word ever used to denote the inhabitants of a country united in the same profession, as when we say the "Church of England," the "Church of Scotland," etc.</description>
    <description>We find the word ecclesia used in the following senses in the New Testament: (1.) It is translated "assembly" in the ordinary classical sense (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 19:32, 39, 41</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(2.) It denotes the whole body of the redeemed, all those whom the Father has given to Christ, the invisible catholic church (<reflink target="XXX">Eph. 5:23, 25, 27, 29; Heb. 12:23</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(3.) A few Christians associated together in observing the ordinances of the gospel are an ecclesia (<reflink target="XXX">Rom. 16:5; Col. 4:15</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(4.) All the Christians in a particular city, whether they assembled together in one place or in several places for religious worship, were an ecclesia. Thus all the disciples in Antioch, forming several congregations, were one church (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 13:1</reflink>); so also we read of the "church of God at Corinth" (<reflink target="XXX">1 Cor. 1:2</reflink>), "the church at Jerusalem" (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 8:1</reflink>), "the church of Ephesus" (<reflink target="XXX">Rev. 2:1</reflink>), etc.</description>
    <description>(5.) The whole body of professing Christians throughout the world (<reflink target="XXX">1 Cor. 15:9; Gal. 1:13; Matt. 16:18</reflink>) are the church of Christ.</description>
    <description>The church visible "consists of all those throughout the world that profess the true religion, together with their children." It is called "visible" because its members are known and its assemblies are public. Here there is a mixture of "wheat and chaff," of saints and sinners. "God has commanded his people to organize themselves into distinct visible ecclesiastical communities, with constitutions, laws, and officers, badges, ordinances, and discipline, for the great purpose of giving visibility to his kingdom, of making known the gospel of that kingdom, and of gathering in all its elect subjects. Each one of these distinct organized communities which is faithful to the great King is an integral part of the visible church, and all together constitute the catholic or universal visible church." A credible profession of the true religion constitutes a person a member of this church. This is "the kingdom of heaven," whose character and progress are set forth in the parables recorded in Matt. 13.</description>
    <description>The children of all who thus profess the true religion are members of the visible church along with their parents. Children are included in every covenant God ever made with man. They go along with their parents (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 9:9-17; 12:1-3; 17:7; Ex. 20:5; Deut. 29:10-13</reflink>). Peter, on the day of Pentecost, at the beginning of the New Testament dispensation, announces the same great principle. "The promise [just as to Abraham and his seed the promises were made] is unto you, and to your children" (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 2:38, 39</reflink>). The children of believing parents are "holy", i.e., are "saints", a title which designates the members of the Christian church (<reflink target="XXX">1 Cor. 7:14</reflink>). (<see target="x-self">See BAPTISM.</see>)</description>
    <description>The church invisible "consists of the whole number of the elect that have been, are, or shall be gathered into one under Christ, the head thereof." This is a pure society, the church in which Christ dwells. It is the body of Christ. it is called "invisible" because the greater part of those who constitute it are already in heaven or are yet unborn, and also because its members still on earth cannot certainly be distinguished. The qualifications of membership in it are internal and are hidden. It is unseen except by Him who "searches the heart." "The Lord knoweth them that are his" (<reflink target="XXX">2 Tim. 2:19</reflink>).</description>
    <description>The church to which the attributes, prerogatives, and promises appertaining to Christ's kingdom belong, is a spiritual body consisting of all true believers, i.e., the church invisible.</description>
    <description>(1.) Its unity. God has ever had only one church on earth. We sometimes speak of the Old Testament Church and of the New Testament church, but they are one and the same. The Old Testament church was not to be changed but enlarged (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 49:13-23; 60:1-14</reflink>). When the Jews are at length restored, they will not enter a new church, but will be grafted again into "their own olive tree" (<reflink target="XXX">Rom. 11:18-24; comp. Eph. 2:11-22</reflink>). The apostles did not set up a new organization. Under their ministry disciples were "added" to the "church" already existing (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 2:47</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(2.) Its universality. It is the "catholic" church; not confined to any particular country or outward organization, but comprehending all believers throughout the whole world.</description>
    <description>(3.) Its perpetuity. It will continue through all ages to the end of the world. It can never be destroyed. It is an "everlasting kindgdom."</description>

  <item id="Churl">
    <description>in Isa. 32:5 (R.V. marg., "crafty"), means a deceiver. In 1 Sam. 25:3, the word churlish denotes a man that is coarse and ill-natured, or, as the word literally means, "hard." The same Greek word as used by the LXX. here is found in Matt. 25:24, and there is rendered "hard."</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Chushan-rishathaim">
    <description>Cush of double wickedness, or governor of two presidencies, the king of Mesopotamia who oppressed Israel in the generation immediately following Joshua (<reflink target="XXX">Judg. 3:8</reflink>). We learn from the Tell-el-Amarna tablets that Palestine had been invaded by the forces of Aram-naharaim (A.V., "Mesopotamia") more than once, long before the Exodus, and that at the time they were written the king of Aram-naharaim was still intriguing in Canaan. It is mentioned among the countries which took part in the attack upon Egypt in the reign of Rameses III. (of the Twentieth Dynasty), but as its king is not one of the princes stated to have been conquered by the Pharaoh, it would seem that he did not actually enter Egypt. As the reign of Rameses III. corresponds with the Israelitish occupation of Canaan, it is probable that the Egyptian monuments refer to the oppression of the Israelites by Chushan-rishathaim. Canaan was still regarded as a province of Egypt, so that, in attacking it Chushan-rishathaim would have been considered to be attacking Egypt.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Cilicia">
    <description>a maritime province in the south-east of Asia Minor. Tarsus, the birth-place of Paul, was one of its chief towns, and the seat of a celebrated school of philosophy. Its luxurious climate attracted to it many Greek residents after its incorporation with the Macedonian empire. It was formed into a Roman province, B.C. 67. The Jews of Cilicia had a synagogue at Jerusalem (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 6:9</reflink>). Paul visited it soon after his conversion (<reflink target="XXX">Gal. 1:21; Acts 9:30</reflink>), and again, on his second missionary journey (15:41), "he went through Syria and Cilicia, confirming the churches." It was famous for its goat's-hair cloth, called cilicium. Paul learned in his youth the trade of making tents of this cloth.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Cinnamon">
    <description>Heb. kinamon, the Cinnamomum zeylanicum of botanists, a tree of the Laurel family, which grows only in India on the Malabar coast, in Ceylon, and China. There is no trace of it in Egypt, and it was unknown in Syria. The inner rind when dried and rolled into cylinders forms the cinnamon of commerce. The fruit and coarser pieces of bark when boiled yield a fragrant oil. It was one of the principal ingredients in the holy anointing oil (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 30:23</reflink>). It is mentioned elsewhere only in Prov. 7:17; Cant. 4:14; Rev. 18:13. The mention of it indicates a very early and extensive commerce carried on between Palestine and the East.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Cinnereth">
    <description>a harp, one of the "fenced cities" of Naphtali (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 19:35; comp. Deut. 3:17</reflink>). It also denotes, apparently, a district which may have taken its name from the adjacent city or lake of Gennesaret, anciently called "the sea of Chinnereth" (q.v.), and was probably that enclosed district north of Tiberias afterwards called "the plain of Gennesaret." Called Chinneroth (R.V., Chinnereth) Josh. 11:2. The phrase "all Cinneroth, with all the land of Naphtali" in 1 Kings 15:20 is parallel to "the store-houses of the cities of Naphtali" (R.V. marg.) in 2 Chr. 16:4.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Circuit">
    <description>the apparent diurnal revolution of the sun round the earth (<reflink target="XXX">Ps. 19:6</reflink>), and the changes of the wind (<reflink target="XXX">Eccl. 1:6</reflink>). In Job 22:14, "in the circuit of heaven" (R.V. marg., "on the vault of heaven") means the "arch of heaven," which seems to be bent over our heads.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Circumcision">
    <description>cutting around. This rite, practised before, as some think, by divers races, was appointed by God to be the special badge of his chosen people, an abiding sign of their consecration to him. It was established as a national ordinance (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 17:10, 11</reflink>). In compliance with the divine command, Abraham, though ninety-nine years of age, was circumcised on the same day with Ishmael, who was thirteen years old (17:24-27). Slaves, whether home-born or purchased, were circumcised (17:12, 13); and all foreigners must have their males circumcised before they could enjoy the privileges of Jewish citizenship (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 12:48</reflink>). During the journey through the wilderness, the practice of circumcision fell into disuse, but was resumed by the command of Joshua before they entered the Promised Land (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 5:2-9</reflink>). It was observed always afterwards among the tribes of israel, although it is not expressly mentioned from the time of the settlement in Canaan till the time of Christ, about 1,450 years. The Jews prided themselves in the possession of this covenant distinction (<reflink target="XXX">Judg. 14:3; 15:18; 1 Sam. 14:6; 17:26; 2 Sam. 1:20; Ezek. 31:18</reflink>).</description>
    <description>As a rite of the church it ceased when the New Testament times began (<reflink target="XXX">Gal. 6:15; Col. 3:11</reflink>). Some Jewish Christians sought to impose it, however, on the Gentile converts; but this the apostles resolutely resisted (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 15:1; Gal. 6:12</reflink>). Our Lord was circumcised, for it "became him to fulfil all righteousness," as of the seed of Abraham, according to the flesh; and Paul "took and circumcised" Timothy (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 16:3</reflink>), to avoid giving offence to the Jews. It would render Timothy's labours more acceptable to the Jews. But Paul would by no means consent to the demand that Titus should be circumcised (<reflink target="XXX">Gal. 2:3-5</reflink>). The great point for which he contended was the free admission of uncircumcised Gentiles into the church. He contended successfully in behalf of Titus, even in Jerusalem.</description>
    <description>In the Old Testament a spiritual idea is attached to circumcision. It was the symbol of purity (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 52:1</reflink>). We read of uncircumcised lips (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 6:12, 30</reflink>), ears (<reflink target="XXX">Jer. 6:10</reflink>), hearts (<reflink target="XXX">Lev. 26:41</reflink>). The fruit of a tree that is unclean is spoken of as uncircumcised (<reflink target="XXX">Lev. 19:23</reflink>).</description>
    <description>It was a sign and seal of the covenant of grace as well as of the national covenant between God and the Hebrews. (1.) It sealed the promises made to Abraham, which related to the commonwealth of Israel, national promises. (2.) But the promises made to Abraham included the promise of redemption (<reflink target="XXX">Gal. 3:14</reflink>), a promise which has come upon us. The covenant with Abraham was a dispensation or a specific form of the covenant of grace, and circumcision was a sign and seal of that covenant. It had a spiritual meaning. It signified purification of the heart, inward circumcision effected by the Spirit (<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 10:16; 30:6; Ezek. 44:7; Acts 7:51; Rom. 2:28; Col. 2:11</reflink>). Circumcision as a symbol shadowing forth sanctification by the Holy Spirit has now given way to the symbol of baptism (q.v.). But the truth embodied in both ordinances is ever the same, the removal of sin, the sanctifying effects of grace in the heart.</description>
    <description>Under the Jewish dispensation, church and state were identical. No one could be a member of the one without also being a member of the other. Circumcision was a sign and seal of membership in both. Every circumcised person bore thereby evidence that he was one of the chosen people, a member of the church of God as it then existed, and consequently also a member of the Jewish commonwealth.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Cistern">
    <description>the rendering of a Hebrew word _bor_, which means a receptacle for water conveyed to it; distinguished from _beer_, which denotes a place where water rises on the spot (<reflink target="XXX">Jer. 2:13; Prov. 5:15; Isa. 36:16</reflink>), a fountain. Cisterns are frequently mentioned in Scripture. The scarcity of springs in Palestine made it necessary to collect rain-water in reservoirs and cisterns (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 21:22</reflink>). (<see target="x-self">See WELL.</see>)</description>
    <description>Empty cisterns were sometimes used as prisons (<reflink target="XXX">Jer. 38:6; Lam. 3:53; Ps. 40:2; 69:15</reflink>). The "pit" into which Joseph was cast (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 37:24</reflink>) was a _beer_ or dry well. There are numerous remains of ancient cisterns in all parts of Palestine.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Citizenship">
    <description>the rights and privileges of a citizen in distinction from a foreigner (<reflink target="XXX">Luke 15:15; 19:14; Acts 21:39</reflink>). Under the Mosaic law non-Israelites, with the exception of the Moabites and the Ammonites and others mentioned in Deut. 23:1-3, were admitted to the general privileges of citizenship among the Jews (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 12:19; Lev. 24:22; Num. 15:15; 35:15; Deut. 10:18; 14:29; 16:10, 14</reflink>).</description>
    <description>The right of citizenship under the Roman government was granted by the emperor to individuals, and sometimes to provinces, as a favour or as a recompense for services rendered to the state, or for a sum of money (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 22:28</reflink>). This "freedom" secured privileges equal to those enjoyed by natives of Rome. Among the most notable of these was the provision that a man could not be bound or imprisoned without a formal trial (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 22:25, 26</reflink>), or scourged (16:37). All Roman citizens had the right of appeal to Caesar (25:11).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="City">
    <description>The earliest mention of city-building is that of Enoch, which was built by Cain (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 4:17</reflink>). After the confusion of tongues, the descendants of Nimrod founded several cities (10:10-12). Next, we have a record of the cities of the Canaanites, Sidon, Gaza, Sodom, etc. (10:12, 19; 11:3, 9; 36:31-39). The earliest description of a city is that of Sodom (19:1-22). Damascus is said to be the oldest existing city in the world. Before the time of Abraham there were cities in Egypt (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 13:22</reflink>). The Israelites in Egypt were employed in building the "treasure cities" of Pithom and Raamses (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 1:11</reflink>); but it does not seem that they had any cities of their own in Goshen (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 46:34; 47:1-11</reflink>). In the kingdom of Og in Bashan there were sixty "great cities with walls," and twenty-three cities in Gilead partly rebuilt by the tribes on the east of Jordan (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 21:21, 32, 33, 35; 32:1-3, 34-42; Deut. 3:4, 5, 14; 1 Kings 4:13</reflink>). On the west of Jordan were thirty-one "royal cities" (Josh. 12), besides many others spoken of in the history of Israel.</description>
    <description>A fenced city was a city surrounded by fortifications and high walls, with watch-towers upon them (<reflink target="XXX">2 Chr. 11:11; Deut. 3:5</reflink>). There was also within the city generally a tower to which the citizens might flee when danger threatened them (<reflink target="XXX">Judg. 9:46-52</reflink>).</description>
    <description>A city with suburbs was a city surrounded with open pasture-grounds, such as the forty-eight cities which were given to the Levites (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 35:2-7</reflink>). There were six cities of refuge, three on each side of Jordan, namely, Kadesh, Shechem, Hebron, on the west of Jordan; and on the east, Bezer, Ramoth-gilead, and Golan. The cities on each side of the river were nearly opposite each other. The regulations concerning these cities are given in Num. 35:9-34; Deut. 19:1-13; Ex. 21:12-14.</description>
    <description>When David reduced the fortress of the Jebusites which stood on Mount Zion, he built on the site of it a palace and a city, which he called by his own name (<reflink target="XXX">1 Chr. 11:5</reflink>), the city of David. Bethlehem is also so called as being David's native town (<reflink target="XXX">Luke 2:4</reflink>).</description>
    <description>Jerusalem is called the Holy City, the holiness of the temple being regarded as extending in some measure over the whole city (<reflink target="XXX">Neh. 11:1</reflink>).</description>
    <description>Pithom and Raamses, built by the Israelites as "treasure cities," were not places where royal treasures were kept, but were fortified towns where merchants might store their goods and transact their business in safety, or cities in which munitions of war were stored. (<see target="x-self">See PITHOM.</see>)</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Clauda">
    <description>a small island off the southwest coast of Crete, passed by Paul on his voyage to Rome (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 27:16</reflink>). It is about 7 miles long and 3 broad. It is now called Gozzo (R.V., "Cauda").</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Claudia">
    <description>a female Christian mentioned in 2 Tim. 4:21. It is a conjecture having some probability that she was a British maiden, the daughter of king Cogidunus, who was an ally of Rome, and assumed the name of the emperor, his patron, Tiberius Claudius, and that she was the wife of Pudens.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Claudius">
    <description>lame. (1.) The fourth Roman emperor. He succeeded Caligula (A.D. 41). Though in general he treated the Jews, especially those in Asia and Egypt, with great indulgence, yet about the middle of his reign (A.D. 49) he banished them all from Rome (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 18:2</reflink>). In this edict the Christians were included, as being, as was supposed, a sect of Jews. The Jews, however soon again returned to Rome.</description>
    <description>During the reign of this emperor, several persecutions of the Christians by the Jews took place in the dominions of Herod Agrippa, in one of which the apostle James was "killed" (12:2). He died A.D. 54.</description>
    <description>(2.) Claudius Lysias, a Greek who, having obtained by purchase the privilege of Roman citizenship, took the name of Claudius (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 21:31-40; 22:28; 23:26</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Clay">
    <description>This word is used of sediment found in pits or in streets (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 57:20; Jer. 38:60</reflink>), of dust mixed with spittle (<reflink target="XXX">John 9:6</reflink>), and of potter's clay (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 41:25; Nah. 3:14; Jer. 18:1-6; Rom. 9:21</reflink>). Clay was used for sealing (<reflink target="XXX">Job 38:14; Jer. 32:14</reflink>). Our Lord's tomb may have been thus sealed (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 27:66</reflink>). The practice of sealing doors with clay is still common in the East. Clay was also in primitive times used for mortar (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 11:3</reflink>). The "clay ground" in which the large vessels of the temple were cast (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 7:46; 2 Chr. 4:17</reflink>) was a compact loam fitted for the purpose. The expression literally rendered is, "in the thickness of the ground,", meaning, "in stiff ground" or in clay.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Clean">
    <description>The various forms of uncleanness according to the Mosaic law are enumerated in Lev. 11-15; Num. 19. The division of animals into clean and unclean was probably founded on the practice of sacrifice. It existed before the Flood (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 7:2</reflink>). The regulations regarding such animals are recorded in Lev. 11 and Deut. 14:1-21.</description>
    <description>The Hebrews were prohibited from using as food certain animal substances, such as (1) blood; (2) the fat covering the intestines, termed the caul; (3) the fat on the intestines, called the mesentery; (4) the fat of the kidneys; and (5) the fat tail of certain sheep (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 29:13, 22; Lev. 3:4-9; 9:19; 17:10; 19:26</reflink>).</description>
    <description>The chief design of these regulations seems to have been to establish a system of regimen which would distinguish the Jews from all other nations. Regarding the design and the abolition of these regulations the reader will find all the details in Lev. 20:24-26; Acts 10:9-16; 11:1-10; Heb. 9:9-14.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Clement">
    <description>mild, a Christian of Philippi, Paul's "fellow-labourer," whose name he mentions as "in the book of life" (<reflink target="XXX">Phil. 4:3</reflink>). It was an opinion of ancient writers that he was the Clement of Rome whose name is well known in church history, and that he was the author of an Epistle to the Corinthians, the only known manuscript of which is appended to the Alexandrian Codex, now in the British Museum. It is of some historical interest, and has given rise to much discussion among critics. It makes distinct reference to Paul's First Epistle to the Corinthians.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Cleopas">
    <description>(abbreviation of Cleopatros), one of the two disciples with whom Jesus conversed on the way to Emmaus on the day of the resurrection (<reflink target="XXX">Luke 24:18</reflink>). We know nothing definitely regarding him. It is not certain that he was the Clopas of John 19:25, or the Alphaeus of Matt. 10:3, although he may have been so.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Cleophas">
    <description>(in the spelling of this word _h_ is inserted by mistake from Latin MSS.), rather Cleopas, which is the Greek form of the word, while Clopas is the Aramaic form. In John 19:25 the Authorized Version reads, "Mary, the wife of Clopas." The word "wife" is conjecturally inserted here. If "wife" is rightly inserted, then Mary was the mother of James the Less, and Clopas is the same as Alphaeus (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 10:3; 27:56</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Cloak">
    <description>an upper garment, "an exterior tunic, wide and long, reaching to the ankles, but without sleeves" (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 59:17</reflink>). The word so rendered is elsewhere rendered "robe" or "mantle." It was worn by the high priest under the ephod (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 28:31</reflink>), by kings and others of rank (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 15:27; Job 1:20; 2:12</reflink>), and by women (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 13:18</reflink>).</description>
    <description>The word translated "cloke", i.e., outer garment, in Matt. 5:40 is in its plural form used of garments in general (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 17:2; 26:65</reflink>). The cloak mentioned here and in Luke 6:29 was the Greek himation, Latin pallium, and consisted of a large square piece of wollen cloth fastened round the shoulders, like the abba of the Arabs. This could be taken by a creditor (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 22:26,27</reflink>), but the coat or tunic (Gr. chiton) mentioned in Matt. 5:40 could not.</description>
    <description>The cloak which Paul "left at Troas" (<reflink target="XXX">2 Tim. 4:13</reflink>) was the Roman paenula, a thick upper garment used chiefly in travelling as a protection from the weather. Some, however, have supposed that what Paul meant was a travelling-bag. In the Syriac version the word used means a bookcase. (<see target="x-self">See Dress.</see>)</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Closet">
    <description>as used in the New Testament, signifies properly a storehouse (<reflink target="XXX">Luke 12: 24</reflink>), and hence a place of privacy and retirement (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 6:6; Luke 12:3</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Cloud">
    <description>The Hebrew so rendered means "a covering," because clouds cover the sky. The word is used as a symbol of the Divine presence, as indicating the splendour of that glory which it conceals (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 16:10; 33:9; Num. 11:25; 12:5; Job 22:14; Ps. 18:11</reflink>). A "cloud without rain" is a proverbial saying, denoting a man who does not keep his promise (<reflink target="XXX">Prov. 16:15; Isa. 18:4; 25:5; Jude 1:12</reflink>). A cloud is the figure of that which is transitory (<reflink target="XXX">Job 30:15; Hos. 6:4</reflink>). A bright cloud is the symbolical seat of the Divine presence (<reflink target="XXX">Ex.29:42, 43; 1 Kings 8:10; 2 Chr. 5:14; Ezek. 43:4</reflink>), and was called the Shechinah (q.v.). Jehovah came down upon Sinai in a cloud (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 19:9</reflink>); and the cloud filled the court around the tabernacle in the wilderness so that Moses could not enter it (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 40:34, 35</reflink>). At the dedication of the temple also the cloud "filled the house of the Lord" (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 8:10</reflink>). Thus in like manner when Christ comes the second time he is described as coming "in the clouds" (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 17:5; 24:30; Acts 1:9, 11</reflink>). False teachers are likened unto clouds carried about with a tempest (<reflink target="XXX">2 Pet. 2:17</reflink>). The infirmities of old age, which come one after another, are compared by Solomon to "clouds returning after the rain" (<reflink target="XXX">Eccl. 12:2</reflink>). The blotting out of sins is like the sudden disappearance of threatening clouds from the sky (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 44:22</reflink>).</description>
    <description>Cloud, the pillar of, was the glory-cloud which indicated God's presence leading the ransomed people through the wilderness (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 13:22; 33:9, 10</reflink>). This pillar preceded the people as they marched, resting on the ark (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 13:21; 40:36</reflink>). By night it became a pillar of fire (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 9:17-23</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Cnidus">
    <description>a town and harbour on the extreme south-west of the peninsula of Doris in Asia Minor. Paul sailed past it on his voyage to Rome after leaving Myra (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 27:7</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Coal">
    <description>It is by no means certain that the Hebrews were acquainted with mineral coal, although it is found in Syria. Their common fuel was dried dung of animals and wood charcoal. Two different words are found in Hebrew to denote coal, both occurring in Prov. 26:21, "As coal [Heb. peham; i.e., "black coal"] is to burning coal [Heb. gehalim]." The latter of these words is used in Job 41:21; Prov. 6:28; Isa. 44:19. The words "live coal" in Isa. 6:6 are more correctly "glowing stone." In Lam. 4:8 the expression "blacker than a coal" is literally rendered in the margin of the Revised Version "darker than blackness." "Coals of fire" (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 22:9, 13; Ps. 18:8, 12, 13, etc.</reflink>) is an expression used metaphorically for lightnings proceeding from God. A false tongue is compared to "coals of juniper" (<reflink target="XXX">Ps. 120:4; James 3:6</reflink>). "Heaping coals of fire on the head" symbolizes overcoming evil with good. The words of Paul (<reflink target="XXX">Rom. 12:20</reflink>) are equivalent to saying, "By charity and kindness thou shalt soften down his enmity as surely as heaping coals on the fire fuses the metal in the crucible."</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Coat">
    <description>the tunic worn like the shirt next the skin (<reflink target="XXX">Lev. 16:4; Cant. 5:3; 2 Sam. 15:32; Ex. 28:4; 29:5</reflink>). The "coats of skins" prepared by God for Adam and Eve were probably nothing more than aprons (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 3:21</reflink>). This tunic was sometimes woven entire without a seam (<reflink target="XXX">John 19:23</reflink>); it was also sometimes of "many colours" (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 37:3; R.V. marg., "a long garment with sleeves"</reflink>). The "fisher's coat" of John 21:7 was obviously an outer garment or cloak, as was also the "coat" made by Hannah for Samuel (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 2:19</reflink>). (<see target="x-self">See DRESS.</see>)</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Coat of mail">
    <description>the rendering of a Hebrew word meaning "glittering" (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 17:5, 38</reflink>). The same word in the plural form is translated "habergeons" in 2 Chr. 26:14 and Neh. 4:16. The "harness" (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 22:34</reflink>), "breastplate" (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 59:17</reflink>), and "brigandine" (<reflink target="XXX">Jer. 46:4</reflink>), were probably also corselets or coats of mail. (<see target="x-self">See ARMOUR.</see>)</description>

  <item id="Cock-crowing">
    <description>In our Lord's time the Jews had adopted the Greek and Roman division of the night into four watches, each consisting of three hours, the first beginning at six o'clock in the evening (<reflink target="XXX">Luke 12:38; Matt. 14:25; Mark 6:48</reflink>). But the ancient division, known as the first and second cock-crowing, was still retained. The cock usually crows several times soon after midnight (this is the first crowing), and again at the dawn of day (and this is the second crowing). Mark mentions (14:30) the two cock-crowings. Matthew (26:34) alludes to that only which was emphatically the cock-crowing, viz, the second.</description>

    <description>the mediaeval name (a corruption of "crocodile") of a fabulous serpent supposed to be produced from a cock's egg. It is generally supposed to denote the cerastes, or "horned viper," a very poisonous serpent about a foot long. Others think it to be the yellow viper (Daboia xanthina), one of the most dangerous vipers, from its size and its nocturnal habits (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 11:8; 14:29; 59:5; Jer. 8:17; in all which the Revised Version renders the Hebrew _tziph'oni_ by "basilisk"</reflink>). In Prov. 23:32 the Hebrew _tzeph'a_ is rendered both in the Authorized Version and the Revised Version by "adder;" margin of Revised Version "basilisk," and of Authorized Version "cockatrice."</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Cockle">
    <description>occurs only in Job 31:40 (marg., "noisome weeds"), where it is the rendering of a Hebrew word (b'oshah) which means "offensive," "having a bad smell," referring to some weed perhaps which has an unpleasant odour. Or it may be regarded as simply any noisome weed, such as the "tares" or darnel of Matt. 13:30. In Isa. 5:2, 4 the plural form is rendered "wild grapes."</description>

  <item id="Coele-Syria">
    <description>hollow Syria, the name (not found in Scripture) given by the Greeks to the extensive valley, about 100 miles long, between the Lebanon and the Anti-Lebanon range of mountains.</description>

  <item id="Coffer">
    <description>the receptacle or small box placed beside the ark by the Philistines, in which they deposited the golden mice and the emerods as their trespass-offering (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 6:8, 11, 15</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Coffin">
    <description>used in Gen. 50:26 with reference to the burial of Joseph. Here, it means a mummy-chest. The same Hebrew word is rendered "chest" in 2 Kings 12:9, 10.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Cogitations">
    <description>(or "thoughts," as the Chaldee word in Dan. 7:28 literally means), earnest meditation.</description>

  <item id="Coin">
    <description>Before the Exile the Jews had no regularly stamped money. They made use of uncoined shekels or talents of silver, which they weighed out (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 23:16; Ex. 38:24; 2 Sam. 18:12</reflink>). Probably the silver ingots used in the time of Abraham may have been of a fixed weight, which was in some way indicated on them. The "pieces of silver" paid by Abimelech to Abraham (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 20:16</reflink>), and those also for which Joseph was sold (37:28), were proably in the form of rings. The shekel was the common standard of weight and value among the Hebrews down to the time of the Captivity. Only once is a shekel of gold mentioned (<reflink target="XXX">1 Chr. 21:25</reflink>). The "six thousand of gold" mentioned in the transaction between Naaman and Gehazi (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 5:5</reflink>) were probably so many shekels of gold. The "piece of money" mentioned in Job 42:11; Gen. 33:19 (marg., "lambs") was the Hebrew _kesitah_, probably an uncoined piece of silver of a certain weight in the form of a sheep or lamb, or perhaps having on it such an impression. The same Hebrew word is used in Josh. 24:32, which is rendered by Wickliffe "an hundred yonge scheep."</description>

  <item id="Collar">
    <description>(Heb. peh), means in Job 30:18 the mouth or opening of the garment that closes round the neck in the same way as a tunic (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 39:23</reflink>). The "collars" (Heb. netiphoth) among the spoils of the Midianites (<reflink target="XXX">Judg. 8:26; R.V., "pendants"</reflink>) were ear-drops. The same Hebrew word is rendered "chains" in Isa. 3:19.</description>

  <item id="Collection">
    <description>The Christians in Palestine, from various causes, suffered from poverty. Paul awakened an interest in them among the Gentile churches, and made pecuniary collections in their behalf (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 24:17; Rom. 15:25, 26; 1 Cor. 16:1-3; 2 Cor. 8:9; Gal. 2:10</reflink>).</description>

  <item id="College">
    <description>Heb. mishneh (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 22:14; 2 Chr. 34:22</reflink>), rendered in Revised Version "second quarter", the residence of the prophetess Huldah. The Authorized Version followed the Jewish commentators, who, following the Targum, gave the Hebrew word its post-Biblical sense, as if it meant a place of instruction. It properly means the "second," and may therefore denote the lower city (Acra), which was built after the portion of the city on Mount Zion, and was enclosed by a second wall.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Colony">
    <description>The city of Philippi was a Roman colony (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 16:12</reflink>), i.e., a military settlement of Roman soldiers and citizens, planted there to keep in subjection a newly-conquered district. A colony was Rome in miniature, under Roman municipal law, but governed by military officers (praetors and lictors), not by proconsuls. It had an independent internal government, the jus Italicum; i.e., the privileges of Italian citizens.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Colossae">
    <description>or Colosse, a city of Phrygia, on the Lycus, which is a tributary of the Maeander. It was about 12 miles above Laodicea, and near the great road from Ephesus to the Euphrates, and was consequently of some mercantile importance. It does not appear that Paul had visited this city when he wrote his letter to the church there (<reflink target="XXX">Col. 1:2</reflink>). He expresses in his letter to Philemon (<reflink target="XXX">ver. 1:22</reflink>) his hope to visit it on being delivered from his imprisonment. From Col. 1:7; 4:12 it has been concluded that Epaphras was the founder of the Colossian church. This town afterwards fell into decay, and the modern town of Chonas or Chonum occupies a site near its ruins.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Colossians, Epistle to the">
    <description>was written by Paul at Rome during his first imprisonment there (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 28:16, 30</reflink>), probably in the spring of A.D. 57, or, as some think, 62, and soon after he had written his Epistle to the Ephesians. Like some of his other epistles (e.g., those to Corinth), this seems to have been written in consequence of information which had somehow been conveyed to him of the internal state of the church there (<reflink target="XXX">Col. 1:4-8</reflink>). Its object was to counteract false teaching. A large part of it is directed against certain speculatists who attempted to combine the doctrines of Oriental mysticism and asceticism with Christianity, thereby promising the disciples the enjoyment of a higher spiritual life and a deeper insight into the world of spirits. Paul argues against such teaching, showing that in Christ Jesus they had all things. He sets forth the majesty of his redemption. The mention of the "new moon" and "sabbath days" (2:16) shows also that there were here Judaizing teachers who sought to draw away the disciples from the simplicity of the gospel.</description>
    <description>Like most of Paul's epistles, this consists of two parts, a doctrinal and a practical.</description>
    <description>(1.) The doctrinal part comprises the first two chapters. His main theme is developed in chapter 2. He warns them against being drawn away from Him in whom dwelt all the fulness of the Godhead, and who was the head of all spiritual powers. Christ was the head of the body of which they were members; and if they were truly united to him, what needed they more?</description>
    <description>(2.) The practical part of the epistle (3-4) enforces various duties naturally flowing from the doctrines expounded. They are exhorted to mind things that are above (3:1-4), to mortify every evil principle of their nature, and to put on the new man (3:5-14). Many special duties of the Christian life are also insisted upon as the fitting evidence of the Christian character. Tychicus was the bearer of the letter, as he was also of that to the Ephesians and to Philemon, and he would tell them of the state of the apostle (4:7-9). After friendly greetings (10-14), he bids them interchange this letter with that he had sent to the neighbouring church of Laodicea. He then closes this brief but striking epistle with his usual autograph salutation. There is a remarkable resemblance between this epistle and that to the Ephesians (q.v.). The genuineness of this epistle has not been called in question.</description>

  <item id="Colour">
    <description>The subject of colours holds an important place in the Scriptures.</description>
    <description>White occurs as the translation of various Hebrew words. It is applied to milk (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 49:12</reflink>), manna (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 16:31</reflink>), snow (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 1:18</reflink>), horses (<reflink target="XXX">Zech. 1:8</reflink>), raiment (<reflink target="XXX">Eccl. 9:8</reflink>). Another Hebrew word so rendered is applied to marble (<reflink target="XXX">Esther 1:6</reflink>), and a cognate word to the lily (<reflink target="XXX">Cant. 2:16</reflink>). A different term, meaning "dazzling," is applied to the countenance (<reflink target="XXX">Cant. 5:10</reflink>).</description>
    <description>This colour was an emblem of purity and innocence (<reflink target="XXX">Mark 16:5; John 20:12; Rev. 19:8, 14</reflink>), of joy (<reflink target="XXX">Eccl. 9:8</reflink>), and also of victory (<reflink target="XXX">Zech. 6:3; Rev. 6:2</reflink>). The hangings of the tabernacle court (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 27:9; 38:9</reflink>), the coats, mitres, bonnets, and breeches of the priests (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 39:27,28</reflink>), and the dress of the high priest on the day of Atonement (<reflink target="XXX">Lev. 16:4,32</reflink>), were white.</description>
    <description>Black, applied to the hair (<reflink target="XXX">Lev. 13:31; Cant. 5:11</reflink>), the complexion (<reflink target="XXX">Cant. 1:5</reflink>), and to horses (<reflink target="XXX">Zech. 6:2,6</reflink>). The word rendered "brown" in Gen. 30:32 (R.V., "black") means properly "scorched", i.e., the colour produced by the influence of the sun's rays. "Black" in Job 30:30 means dirty, blackened by sorrow and disease. The word is applied to a mourner's robes (<reflink target="XXX">Jer. 8:21; 14:2</reflink>), to a clouded sky (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 18:45</reflink>), to night (<reflink target="XXX">Micah 3:6; Jer. 4:28</reflink>), and to a brook rendered turbid by melted snow (<reflink target="XXX">Job 6:16</reflink>). It is used as symbolical of evil in Zech. 6:2, 6 and Rev. 6:5. It was the emblem of mourning, affliction, calamity (<reflink target="XXX">Jer. 14:2; Lam. 4:8; 5:10</reflink>).</description>
    <description>Red, applied to blood (2 Kings 3;22), a heifer (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 19:2</reflink>), pottage of lentils (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 25:30</reflink>), a horse (<reflink target="XXX">Zech. 1:8</reflink>), wine (<reflink target="XXX">Prov. 23:31</reflink>), the complexion (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 25:25; Cant. 5:10</reflink>). This colour is symbolical of bloodshed (<reflink target="XXX">Zech. 6:2; Rev. 6:4; 12:3</reflink>).</description>
    <description>Purple, a colour obtained from the secretion of a species of shell-fish (the Murex trunculus) which was found in the Mediterranean, and particularly on the coasts of Phoenicia and Asia Minor. The colouring matter in each separate shell-fish amounted to only a single drop, and hence the great value of this dye. Robes of this colour were worn by kings (<reflink target="XXX">Judg. 8:26</reflink>) and high officers (<reflink target="XXX">Esther 8:15</reflink>). They were also worn by the wealthy and luxurious (<reflink target="XXX">Jer. 10:9; Ezek. 27:7; Luke 16:19; Rev. 17:4</reflink>). With this colour was associated the idea of royalty and majesty (<reflink target="XXX">Judg. 8:26; Cant. 3:10; 7:5; Dan. 5:7, 16,29</reflink>).</description>
    <description>Blue. This colour was also procured from a species of shell-fish, the chelzon of the Hebrews, and the Helix ianthina of modern naturalists. The tint was emblematic of the sky, the deep dark hue of the Eastern sky. This colour was used in the same way as purple. The ribbon and fringe of the Hebrew dress were of this colour (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 15:38</reflink>). The loops of the curtains (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 26:4</reflink>), the lace of the high priest's breastplate, the robe of the ephod, and the lace on his mitre, were blue (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 28:28, 31, 37</reflink>).</description>
    <description>Scarlet, or Crimson. In Isa. 1:18 a Hebrew word is used which denotes the worm or grub whence this dye was procured. In Gen. 38:28,30, the word so rendered means "to shine," and expresses the brilliancy of the colour. The small parasitic insects from which this dye was obtained somewhat resembled the cochineal which is found in Eastern countries. It is called by naturalists Coccus ilics. The dye was procured from the female grub alone. The only natural object to which this colour is applied in Scripture is the lips, which are likened to a scarlet thread (<reflink target="XXX">Cant. 4:3</reflink>). Scarlet robes were worn by the rich and luxurious (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 1:24; Prov. 31:21; Jer. 4:30. Rev. 17:4</reflink>). It was also the hue of the warrior's dress (<reflink target="XXX">Nah. 2:3; Isa. 9:5</reflink>). The Phoenicians excelled in the art of dyeing this colour (<reflink target="XXX">2 Chr. 2:7</reflink>).</description>
    <description>These four colours--white, purple, blue, and scarlet--were used in the textures of the tabernacle curtains (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 26:1, 31, 36</reflink>), and also in the high priest's ephod, girdle, and breastplate (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 28:5, 6, 8, 15</reflink>). Scarlet thread is mentioned in connection with the rites of cleansing the leper (<reflink target="XXX">Lev. 14:4, 6, 51</reflink>) and of burning the red heifer (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 19:6</reflink>). It was a crimson thread that Rahab was to bind on her window as a sign that she was to be saved alive (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 2:18; 6:25</reflink>) when the city of Jericho was taken.</description>
    <description>Vermilion, the red sulphuret of mercury, or cinnabar; a colour used for drawing the figures of idols on the walls of temples (<reflink target="XXX">Ezek. 23:14</reflink>), or for decorating the walls and beams of houses (<reflink target="XXX">Jer. 22:14</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Comforter">
    <description>the designation of the Holy Ghost (<reflink target="XXX">John 14:16, 26; 15:26; 16:7; R.V. marg., "or Advocate, or Helper; Gr. paracletos"</reflink>). The same Greek word thus rendered is translated "Advocate" in 1 John 2:1 as applicable to Christ. It means properly "one who is summoned to the side of another" to help him in a court of justice by defending him, "one who is summoned to plead a cause." "Advocate" is the proper rendering of the word in every case where it occurs.</description>
    <description>It is worthy of notice that although Paul nowhere uses the word paracletos, he yet presents the idea it embodies when he speaks of the "intercession" both of Christ and the Spirit (<reflink target="XXX">Rom. 8:27, 34</reflink>).</description>

  <item id="Coming of Christ">
    <description>(1) with reference to his first advent "in the fulness of the time" (<reflink target="XXX">1 John 5:20; 2 John 1:7</reflink>), or (2) with reference to his coming again the second time at the last day (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 1:11; 3:20, 21; 1 Thess. 4:15; 2 Tim. 4:1; Heb. 9:28</reflink>).</description>
    <description>The expression is used metaphorically of the introduction of the gospel into any place (<reflink target="XXX">John 15:22; Eph. 2:17</reflink>), the visible establishment of his kingdom in the world (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 16:28</reflink>), the conferring on his people of the peculiar tokens of his love (<reflink target="XXX">John 14:18, 23, 28</reflink>), and his executing judgment on the wicked (<reflink target="XXX">2 Thess. 2:8</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Commandments, the Ten">
    <description>(<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 34:28; Deut. 10:4, marg. "ten words"</reflink>) i.e., the Decalogue (q.v.), is a summary of the immutable moral law. These commandments were first given in their written form to the people of Israel when they were encamped at Sinai, about fifty days after they came out of Egypt (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 19:10-25</reflink>). They were written by the finger of God on two tables of stone. The first tables were broken by Moses when he brought them down from the mount (32:19), being thrown by him on the ground. At the command of God he took up into the mount two other tables, and God wrote on them "the words that were on the first tables" (34:1). These tables were afterwards placed in the ark of the covenant (<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 10:5; 1 Kings 8:9</reflink>). Their subsequent history is unknown. They are as a whole called "the covenant" (<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 4:13</reflink>), and "the tables of the covenant" (9:9, 11; Heb. 9:4), and "the testimony."</description>
    <description>They are obviously "ten" in number, but their division is not fixed, hence different methods of numbering them have been adopted. The Jews make the "Preface" one of the commandments, and then combine the first and second. The Roman Catholics and Lutherans combine the first and second and divide the tenth into two. The Jews and Josephus divide them equally. The Lutherans and Roman Catholics refer three commandments to the first table and seven to the second. The Greek and Reformed Churches refer four to the first and six to the second table. The Samaritans add to the second that Gerizim is the mount of worship. (See LAW</description>

  <item id="Communion">
    <description>fellowship with God (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 18:17-33; Ex. 33:9-11; Num. 12:7, 8</reflink>), between Christ and his people (<reflink target="XXX">John 14:23</reflink>), by the Spirit (<reflink target="XXX">2 Cor. 13:14; Phil. 2:1</reflink>), of believers with one another (<reflink target="XXX">Eph. 4:1-6</reflink>). The Lord's Supper is so called (<reflink target="XXX">1 Cor. 10:16, 17</reflink>), because in it there is fellowship between Christ and his disciples, and of the disciples with one another.</description>

  <item id="Concision">
    <description>(Gr. katatome; i.e., "mutilation"), a term used by Paul contemptuously of those who were zealots for circumcision (<reflink target="XXX">Phil. 3:2</reflink>). Instead of the warning, "Beware of the circumcision" (peritome) i.e., of the party who pressed on Gentile converts the necessity of still observing that ordinance, he says, "Beware of the concision;" as much as to say, "This circumcision which they vaunt of is in Christ only as the gashings and mutilations of idolatrous heathen."</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Concubine">
    <description>in the Bible denotes a female conjugally united to a man, but in a relation inferior to that of a wife. Among the early Jews, from various causes, the difference between a wife and a concubine was less marked than it would be amongst us. The concubine was a wife of secondary rank. There are various laws recorded providing for their protection (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 21:7; Deut. 21:10-14</reflink>), and setting limits to the relation they sustained to the household to which they belonged (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 21:14; 25:6</reflink>). They had no authority in the family, nor could they share in the household government.</description>
    <description>The immediate cause of concubinage might be gathered from the conjugal histories of Abraham and Jacob (Gen. 16;30). But in process of time the custom of concubinage degenerated, and laws were made to restrain and regulate it (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 21:7-9</reflink>).</description>
    <description>Christianity has restored the sacred institution of marriage to its original character, and concubinage is ranked with the sins of fornication and adultery (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 19:5-9; 1 Cor. 7:2</reflink>).</description>

  <item id="Concupiscence">
    <description>desire, Rom. 7:8 (R.V., "coveting"); Col. 3:5 (R.V., "desire"). The "lust of concupiscence" (<reflink target="XXX">1 Thess. 4:5; R.V., "passion of lust"</reflink>) denotes evil desire, indwelling sin.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Conduit">
    <description>a water-course or channel (<reflink target="XXX">Job 38:25</reflink>). The "conduit of the upper pool" (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 7:3</reflink>) was formed by Hezekiah for the purpose of conveying the waters from the upper pool in the valley of Gihon to the west side of the city of David (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 18:17; 20:20; 2 Chr. 32:30</reflink>). In carrying out this work he stopped "the waters of the fountains which were without the city" i.e., "the upper water-course of Gihon", and conveyed it down from the west through a canal into the city, so that in case of a siege the inhabitants of the city might have a supply of water, which would thus be withdrawn from the enemy. (<see target="x-self">See SILOAM.</see>)</description>
    <description>There are also the remains of a conduit which conducted water from the so-called "Pools of Solomon," beyond Bethlehem, into the city. Water is still conveyed into the city from the fountains which supplied these pools by a channel which crosses the valley of Hinnom.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Coney">
    <description>(Heb. shaphan; i.e., "the hider"), an animal which inhabits the mountain gorges and the rocky districts of Arabia Petraea and the Holy Land. "The conies are but a feeble folk, yet make they their houses in the rocks" (<reflink target="XXX">Prov. 30:26; Ps. 104:18</reflink>). They are gregarious, and "exceeding wise" (<reflink target="XXX">Prov. 30:24</reflink>), and are described as chewing the cud (<reflink target="XXX">Lev. 11:5; Deut. 14:7</reflink>).</description>
    <description>The animal intended by this name is known among naturalists as the Hyrax Syriacus. It is neither a ruminant nor a rodent, but is regarded as akin to the rhinoceros. When it is said to "chew the cud," the Hebrew word so used does not necessarily imply the possession of a ruminant stomach. "The lawgiver speaks according to appearances; and no one can watch the constant motion of the little creature's jaws, as it sits continually working its teeth, without recognizing the naturalness of the expression" (Tristram, Natural History of the Bible). It is about the size and color of a rabbit, though clumsier in structure, and without a tail. Its feet are not formed for digging, and therefore it has its home not in burrows but in the clefts of the rocks. "Coney" is an obsolete English word for "rabbit."</description>

  <item id="Confection">
    <description>(<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 30:35, "ointment" in ver. 25; R.V., "perfume"</reflink>). The Hebrew word so rendered is derived from a root meaning to compound oil and perfume.</description>

  <item id="Congregation">
    <description>(Heb. kahal), the Hebrew people collectively as a holy community (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 15:15</reflink>). Every circumcised Hebrew from twenty years old and upward was a member of the congregation. Strangers resident in the land, if circumcised, were, with certain exceptions (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 12:19; Num. 9:14; Deut. 23:1-3</reflink>), admitted to the privileges of citizenship, and spoken of as members of the congregation (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 12:19; Num. 9:14; 15:15</reflink>). The congregation were summonded together by the sound of two silver trumpets, and they met at the door of the tabernacle (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 10:3</reflink>). These assemblies were convened for the purpose of engaging in solemn religious services (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 12:27; Num. 25:6; Joel 2:15</reflink>), or of receiving new commandments (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 19:7, 8</reflink>). The elders, who were summonded by the sound of one trumpet (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 10:4</reflink>), represented on various occasions the whole congregation (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 3:16; 12:21; 17:5; 24:1</reflink>).</description>
    <description>After the conquest of Canaan, the people were assembled only on occasions of the highest national importance (Judg. 20; 2 Chr. 30:5; 34:29; 1 Sam. 10:17; 2 Sam. 5:1-5; 1 Kings 12:20; 2 Kings 11:19; 21:24; 23:30). In subsequent times the congregation was represented by the Sanhedrim; and the name synagogue, applied in the Septuagint version exclusively to the congregation, came to be used to denote the places of worship established by the Jews. (<see target="x-self">See CHURCH.</see>)</description>
    <description>In Acts 13:43, where alone it occurs in the New Testament, it is the same word as that rendered "synagogue" (q.v.) in ver. 42, and is so rendered in ver. 43 in R.V.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Congregation, mount of the">
    <description>(<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 14:13</reflink>), has been supposed to refer to the place where God promised to meet with his people (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 25:22; 29:42, 43</reflink>) i.e., the mount of the Divine presence, Mount Zion. But here the king of Babylon must be taken as expressing himself according to his own heathen notions, and not according to those of the Jews. The "mount of the congregation" will therefore in this case mean the northern mountain, supposed by the Babylonians to be the meeting-place of their gods. In the Babylonian inscriptions mention is made of a mountain which is described as "the mighty mountain of Bel, whose head rivals heaven, whose root is the holy deep." This mountain was regarded in their mythology as the place where the gods had their seat.</description>

    <description>that faculty of the mind, or inborn sense of right and wrong, by which we judge of the moral character of human conduct. It is common to all men. Like all our other faculties, it has been perverted by the Fall (<reflink target="XXX">John 16:2; Acts 26:9; Rom. 2:15</reflink>). It is spoken of as "defiled" (<reflink target="XXX">Titus 1:15</reflink>), and "seared" (<reflink target="XXX">1 Tim. 4:2</reflink>). A "conscience void of offence" is to be sought and cultivated (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 24:16; Rom. 9:1; 2 Cor. 1:12; 1 Tim. 1:5, 19; 1 Pet. 3:21</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Consecration">
    <description>the devoting or setting apart of anything to the worship or service of God. The race of Abraham and the tribe of Levi were thus consecrated (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 13:2, 12, 15; Num. 3:12</reflink>). The Hebrews devoted their fields and cattle, and sometimes the spoils of war, to the Lord (<reflink target="XXX">Lev. 27:28, 29</reflink>). According to the Mosaic law the first-born both of man and beast were consecrated to God.</description>
    <description>In the New Testament, Christians are regarded as consecrated to the Lord (<reflink target="XXX">1 Pet. 2:9</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Consolation of Israel">
    <description>a name for the Messiah in common use among the Jews, probably suggested by Isa. 12:1; 49:13. The Greek word thus rendered (<reflink target="XXX">Luke 2:25, paraklesis</reflink>) is kindred to that translated "Comforter" in John 14:16, etc., parakletos.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Constellation">
    <description>a cluster of stars, or stars which appear to be near each other in the heavens, and which astronomers have reduced to certain figures (as the "Great Bear," the "Bull," etc.) for the sake of classification and of memory. In Isa. 13:10, where this word only occurs, it is the rendering of the Hebrew _kesil_, i.e., "fool." This was the Hebrew name of the constellation Orion (<reflink target="XXX">Job 9:9; 38:31</reflink>), a constellation which represented Nimrod, the symbol of folly and impiety. The word some interpret by "the giant" in this place, "some heaven-daring rebel who was chained to the sky for his impiety."</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Contentment">
    <description>a state of mind in which one's desires are confined to his lot whatever it may be (<reflink target="XXX">1 Tim. 6:6; 2 Cor. 9:8</reflink>). It is opposed to envy (<reflink target="XXX">James 3:16</reflink>), avarice (<reflink target="XXX">Heb. 13:5</reflink>), ambition (<reflink target="XXX">Prov. 13:10</reflink>), anxiety (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 6:25, 34</reflink>), and repining (<reflink target="XXX">1 Cor. 10:10</reflink>). It arises from the inward disposition, and is the offspring of humility, and of an intelligent consideration of the rectitude and benignity of divine providence (<reflink target="XXX">Ps. 96:1, 2; 145</reflink>), the greatness of the divine promises (<reflink target="XXX">2 Pet. 1:4</reflink>), and our own unworthiness (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 32:10</reflink>); as well as from the view the gospel opens up to us of rest and peace hereafter (<reflink target="XXX">Rom. 5:2</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Conversation">
    <description>generally the goings out and in of social intercourse (<reflink target="XXX">Eph. 2:3; 4:22; R.V., "manner of life"</reflink>); one's deportment or course of life. This word is never used in Scripture in the sense of verbal communication from one to another (<reflink target="XXX">Ps. 50:23; Heb. 13:5</reflink>). In Phil. 1:27 and 3:20, a different Greek word is used. It there means one's relations to a community as a citizen, i.e., citizenship.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Conversion">
    <description>the turning of a sinner to God (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 15:3</reflink>). In a general sense the heathen are said to be "converted" when they abandon heathenism and embrace the Christian faith; and in a more special sense men are converted when, by the influence of divine grace in their souls, their whole life is changed, old things pass away, and all things become new (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 26:18</reflink>). Thus we speak of the conversion of the Philippian jailer (16:19-34), of Paul (9:1-22), of the Ethiopian treasurer (8:26-40), of Cornelius (10), of Lydia (16:13-15), and others. (See REGENERATION</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Convocation">
    <description>a meeting of a religious character as distinguished from congregation, which was more general, dealing with political and legal matters. Hence it is called an "holy convocation." Such convocations were the Sabbaths (<reflink target="XXX">Lev. 23:2, 3</reflink>), the Passover (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 12:16; Lev. 23:7, 8; Num. 28:25</reflink>), Pentecost (<reflink target="XXX">Lev. 23:21</reflink>), the feast of Trumpets (<reflink target="XXX">Lev. 23:24; Num. 29:1</reflink>), the feast of Weeks (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 28:26</reflink>), and the feast of Tabernacles (<reflink target="XXX">Lev. 23:35, 36</reflink>). The great fast, the annual day of atonement, was "the holy convocation" (<reflink target="XXX">Lev. 23:27; Num. 29:7</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Cook">
    <description>a person employed to perform culinary service. In early times among the Hebrews cooking was performed by the mistress of the household (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 18:2-6; Judg. 6:19</reflink>), and the process was very expeditiously performed (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 27:3, 4, 9, 10</reflink>). Professional cooks were afterwards employed (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 8:13; 9:23</reflink>). Few animals, as a rule, were slaughtered (other than sacrifices), except for purposes of hospitality (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 18:7; Luke 15:23</reflink>). The paschal lamb was roasted over a fire (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 12:8, 9; 2Chr. 35:13</reflink>). Cooking by boiling was the usual method adopted (<reflink target="XXX">Lev. 8:31; Ex. 16:23</reflink>). No cooking took place on the Sabbath day (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 35:3</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Coos">
    <description>(written Cos in the R.V.), a small island, one of the Sporades in the Aegean Sea, in the north-west of Rhodes, off the coast of Caria. Paul on his return from his third missionary journey, passed the night here after sailing from Miletus (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 21:1</reflink>). It is now called Stanchio.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Copper">
    <description>derived from the Greek kupros (the island of Cyprus), called "Cyprian brass," occurs only in the Authorized Version in Ezra 8:27. Elsewhere the Hebrew word (nehosheth) is improperly rendered "brass," and sometimes "steel" (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 22:35; Jer. 15:12</reflink>). The "bow of steel" (<reflink target="XXX">Job 20:24; Ps. 18:34</reflink>) should have been "bow of copper" (or "brass," as in the R.V.). The vessels of "fine copper" of Ezra 8:27 were probably similar to those of "bright brass" mentioned in 1 Kings 7:45; Dan. 10:6.</description>
    <description>Tubal-cain was the first artificer in brass and iron (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 4:22</reflink>). Hiram was noted as a worker in brass (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 7:14</reflink>). Copper abounded in Palestine (<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 8:9; Isa. 60:17; 1 Chr. 22:3, 14</reflink>). All sorts of vessels in the tabernacle and the temple were made of it (<reflink target="XXX">Lev. 6:28; Num. 16:39; 2 Chr. 4:16; Ezra 8:27</reflink>); also weapons of war (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 17:5, 6, 38; 2 Sam. 21:16</reflink>). Iron is mentioned only four times (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 4:22; Lev. 26:19; Num. 31:22; 35:16</reflink>) in the first four books of Moses, while copper (rendered "brass") is mentioned forty times. (<see target="x-self">See BRASS.</see>)</description>
    <description>We find mention of Alexander (q.v.), a "coppersmith" of Ephesus (<reflink target="XXX">2 Tim. 4:14</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Cor">
    <description>This Hebrew word, untranslated, denotes a round vessel used as a measure both for liquids and solids. It was equal to one homer, and contained ten ephahs in dry and ten baths in liquid measure (<reflink target="XXX">Ezek. 45:14</reflink>). The Rabbins estimated the cor at forty-five gallons, while Josephus estimated it at about eighty-seven. In 1 Kings 4:22; 5:11; 2 Chr. 2:10; 27:5, the original word is rendered "measure."</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Coral">
    <description>Heb. ramoth, meaning "heights;" i.e., "high-priced" or valuable things, or, as some suppose, "that which grows high," like a tree (<reflink target="XXX">Job 28:18; Ezek. 27:16</reflink>), according to the Rabbins, red coral, which was in use for ornaments.</description>
    <description>The coral is a cretaceous marine product, the deposit by minute polypous animals of calcareous matter in cells in which the animal lives. It is of numberless shapes as it grows, but usually is branched like a tree. Great coral reefs and coral islands abound in the Red Sea, whence probably the Hebrews derived their knowledge of it. It is found of different colours, white, black, and red. The red, being esteemed the most precious, was used, as noticed above, for ornamental purposes.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Corban">
    <description>a Hebrew word adopted into the Greek of the New Testament and left untranslated. It occurs only once (<reflink target="XXX">Mark 7:11</reflink>). It means a gift or offering consecrated to God. Anything over which this word was once pronounced was irrevocably dedicated to the temple. Land, however, so dedicated might be redeemed before the year of jubilee (<reflink target="XXX">Lev. 27:16-24</reflink>). Our Lord condemns the Pharisees for their false doctrine, inasmuch as by their traditions they had destroyed the commandment which requires children to honour their father and mother, teaching them to find excuse from helping their parents by the device of pronouncing "Corban" over their goods, thus reserving them to their own selfish use.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Cord">
    <description>frequently used in its proper sense, for fastening a tent (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 35:18; 39:40</reflink>), yoking animals to a cart (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 5:18</reflink>), binding prisoners (<reflink target="XXX">Judg. 15:13; Ps. 2:3; 129:4</reflink>), and measuring ground (2 Sam. 8;2; Ps. 78:55). Figuratively, death is spoken of as the giving way of the tent-cord (<reflink target="XXX">Job 4:21. "Is not their tent-cord plucked up?" R.V.</reflink>). To gird one's self with a cord was a token of sorrow and humiliation. To stretch a line over a city meant to level it with the ground (<reflink target="XXX">Lam. 2:8</reflink>). The "cords of sin" are the consequences or fruits of sin (<reflink target="XXX">Prov. 5:22</reflink>). A "threefold cord" is a symbol of union (<reflink target="XXX">Eccl. 4:12</reflink>). The "cords of a man" (<reflink target="XXX">Hos. 11:4</reflink>) means that men employ, in inducing each other, methods such as are suitable to men, and not "cords" such as oxen are led by. Isaiah (5:18) says, "Woe unto them that draw iniquity with cords of vanity, and sin as it were with a cart rope." This verse is thus given in the Chaldee paraphrase: "Woe to those who begin to sin by little and little, drawing sin by cords of vanity: these sins grow and increase till they are strong and are like a cart rope." This may be the true meaning. The wicked at first draw sin with a slender cord; but by-and-by their sins increase, and they are drawn after them by a cart rope. Henderson in his commentary says: "The meaning is that the persons described were not satisfied with ordinary modes of provoking the Deity, and the consequent ordinary approach of his vengeance, but, as it were, yoked themselves in the harness of iniquity, and, putting forth all their strength, drew down upon themselves, with accelerated speed, the load of punishment which their sins deserved."</description>

  <item id="Coriander">
    <description>Heb. gad, (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 16:31; Num. 11:7</reflink>), seed to which the manna is likened in its form and colour. It is the Coriandrum sativum of botanists, an umbelliferous annual plant with a round stalk, about two feet high. It is widely cultivated in Eastern countries and in the south of Europe for the sake of its seeds, which are in the form of a little ball of the size of a peppercorn. They are used medicinally and as a spice. The Greek name of this plant is korion or koriannon, whence the name "coriander."</description>

  <item id="Corinth">
    <description>a Grecian city, on the isthmus which joins the Peloponnesus to the mainland of Greece. It is about 48 miles west of Athens. The ancient city was destroyed by the Romans (B.C. 146), and that mentioned in the New Testament was quite a new city, having been rebuilt about a century afterwards and peopled by a colony of freedmen from Rome. It became under the Romans the seat of government for Southern Greece or Achaia (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 18:12-16</reflink>). It was noted for its wealth, and for the luxurious and immoral and vicious habits of the people. It had a large mixed population of Romans, Greeks, and Jews. When Paul first visited the city (A.D. 51 or 52), Gallio, the brother of Seneca, was proconsul. Here Paul resided for eighteen months (18:1-18). Here he first became aquainted with Aquila and Priscilla, and soon after his departure Apollos came to it from Ephesus. After an interval he visited it a second time, and remained for three months (20:3). During this second visit his Epistle to the Romans was written (probably A.D. 55). Although there were many Jewish converts at Corinth, yet the Gentile element prevailed in the church there.</description>
    <description>Some have argued from 2 Cor. 12:14; 13:1, that Paul visited Corinth a third time (i.e., that on some unrecorded occasion he visited the city between what are usually called the first and second visits). But the passages referred to only indicate Paul's intention to visit Corinth (comp. 1 Cor. 16:5, where the Greek present tense denotes an intention), an intention which was in some way frustrated. We can hardly suppose that such a visit could have been made by the apostle without more distinct reference to it.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Corinthians, First Epistle to the">
    <description>was written from Ephesus (<reflink target="XXX">1 Cor. 16:8</reflink>) about the time of the Passover in the third year of the apostle's sojourn there (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 19:10; 20:31</reflink>), and when he had formed the purpose to visit Macedonia, and then return to Corinth (probably A.D. 57).</description>
    <description>The news which had reached him, however, from Corinth frustrated his plan. He had heard of the abuses and contentions that had arisen among them, first from Apollos (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 19:1</reflink>), and then from a letter they had written him on the subject, and also from some of the "household of Chloe," and from Stephanas and his two friends who had visited him (<reflink target="XXX">1 Cor. 1:11; 16:17</reflink>). Paul thereupon wrote this letter, for the purpose of checking the factious spirit and correcting the erroneous opinions that had sprung up among them, and remedying the many abuses and disorderly practices that prevailed. Titus and a brother whose name is not given were probably the bearers of the letter (<reflink target="XXX">2 Cor. 2:13; 8:6, 16-18</reflink>).</description>
    <description>The epistle may be divided into four parts:</description>
    <description>(1.) The apostle deals with the subject of the lamentable divisions and party strifes that had arisen among them (1 Cor. 1-4).</description>
    <description>(2.) He next treats of certain cases of immorality that had become notorious among them. They had apparently set at nought the very first principles of morality (5; 6).</description>
    <description>(3.) In the third part he discusses various questions of doctrine and of Christian ethics in reply to certain communications they had made to him. He especially rectifies certain flagrant abuses regarding the celebration of the Lord's supper (7-14).</description>
    <description>(4.) The concluding part (15; 16) contains an elaborate defense of the doctrine of the resurrection of the dead, which had been called in question by some among them, followed by some general instructions, intimations, and greetings.</description>
    <description>This epistle "shows the powerful self-control of the apostle in spite of his physical weakness, his distressed circumstances, his incessant troubles, and his emotional nature. It was written, he tells us, in bitter anguish, 'out of much affliction and pressure of heart...and with streaming eyes' (<reflink target="XXX">2 Cor. 2:4</reflink>); yet he restrained the expression of his feelings, and wrote with a dignity and holy calm which he thought most calculated to win back his erring children. It gives a vivid picture of the early church...It entirely dissipates the dream that the apostolic church was in an exceptional condition of holiness of life or purity of doctrine." The apostle in this epistle unfolds and applies great principles fitted to guide the church of all ages in dealing with the same and kindred evils in whatever form they may appear.</description>
    <description>This is one of the epistles the authenticity of which has never been called in question by critics of any school, so many and so conclusive are the evidences of its Pauline origin.</description>
    <description>The subscription to this epistle states erroneously in the Authorized Version that it was written at Philippi. This error arose from a mistranslation of 1 Cor. 16:5, "For I do pass through Macedonia," which was interpreted as meaning, "I am passing through Macedonia." In 16:8 he declares his intention of remaining some time longer in Ephesus. After that, his purpose is to "pass through Macedonia."</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Corinthians, Second Epistle to the">
    <description>Shortly after writing his first letter to the Corinthians, Paul left Ephesus, where intense excitement had been aroused against him, the evidence of his great success, and proceeded to Macedonia. Pursuing the usual route, he reached Troas, the port of departure for Europe. Here he expected to meet with Titus, whom he had sent from Ephesus to Corinth, with tidings of the effects produced on the church there by the first epistle; but was disappointed (<reflink target="XXX">1 Cor. 16:9; 2 Cor. 1:8; 2:12, 13</reflink>). He then left Troas and proceeded to Macedonia; and at Philippi, where he tarried, he was soon joined by Titus (<reflink target="XXX">2 Cor. 7:6, 7</reflink>), who brought him good news from Corinth, and also by Timothy. Under the influence of the feelings awakened in his mind by the favourable report which Titus brought back from Corinth, this second epistle was written. It was probably written at Philippi, or, as some think, Thessalonica, early in the year A.D. 58, and was sent to Corinth by Titus. This letter he addresses not only to the church in Corinth, but also to the saints in all Achaia, i.e., in Athens, Cenchrea, and other cities in Greece.</description>
    <description>The contents of this epistle may be thus arranged:</description>
    <description>(1.) Paul speaks of his spiritual labours and course of life, and expresses his warm affection toward the Corinthians (2 Cor. 1-7).</description>
    <description>(2.) He gives specific directions regarding the collection that was to be made for their poor brethren in Judea (8; 9).</description>
    <description>(3.) He defends his own apostolic claim (10-13), and justifies himself from the charges and insinuations of the false teacher and his adherents.</description>
    <description>This epistle, it has been well said, shows the individuallity of the apostle more than any other. "Human weakness, spiritual strength, the deepest tenderness of affection, wounded feeling, sternness, irony, rebuke, impassioned self-vindication, humility, a just self-respect, zeal for the welfare of the weak and suffering, as well as for the progress of the church of Christ and for the spiritual advancement of its members, are all displayed in turn in the course of his appeal."--Lias, Second Corinthians.</description>
    <description>Of the effects produced on the Corinthian church by this epistle we have no definite information. We know that Paul visited Corinth after he had written it (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 20:2, 3</reflink>), and that on that occasion he tarried there for three months. In his letter to Rome, written at this time, he sent salutations from some of the principal members of the church to the Romans.</description>

  <item id="Cormorant">
    <description>(<reflink target="XXX">Lev. 11:17; Deut. 14:17</reflink>), Heb. shalak, "plunging," or "darting down," (the Phalacrocorax carbo), ranked among the "unclean" birds; of the same family group as the pelican. It is a "plunging" bird, and is common on the coasts and the island seas of Palestine. Some think the Hebrew word should be rendered "gannet" (Sula bassana, "the solan goose"); others that it is the "tern" or "sea swallow," which also frequents the coasts of Palestine as well as the Sea of Galilee and the Jordan valley during several months of the year. But there is no reason to depart from the ordinary rendering.</description>
    <description>In Isa. 34:11, Zeph. 2:14 (but in R.V., "pelican") the Hebrew word rendered by this name is _ka'ath_. It is translated "pelican" (q.v.) in Ps. 102:6. The word literally means the "vomiter," and the pelican is so called from its vomiting the shells and other things which it has voraciously swallowed. (<see target="x-self">See PELICAN.</see>)</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Corn">
    <description>The word so rendered (dagan) in Gen. 27:28, 37, Num. 18:27, Deut. 28:51, Lam. 2:12, is a general term representing all the commodities we usually describe by the words corn, grain, seeds, peas, beans. With this corresponds the use of the word in John 12:24.</description>
    <description>In Gen. 41:35, 49, Prov. 11:26, Joel 2:24 ("wheat"), the word thus translated (bar; i.e., "winnowed") means corn purified from chaff. With this corresponds the use of the word in the New Testament (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 3:12; Luke 3:17; Acts 7:12</reflink>). In Ps. 65:13 it means "growing corn."</description>
    <description>In Gen. 42:1, 2, 19, Josh. 9:14, Neh. 10:31 ("victuals"), the word (sheber; i.e., "broken," i.e., grist) denotes generally victuals, provisions, and corn as a principal article of food.</description>
    <description>From the time of Solomon, corn began to be exported from Palestine (<reflink target="XXX">Ezek. 27:17; Amos 8:5</reflink>). "Plenty of corn" was a part of Issac's blessing conferred upon Jacob (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 27:28; comp. Ps. 65:13</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Cornelius">
    <description>a centurion whose history is narrated in Acts 10. He was a "devout man," and like the centurion of Capernaum, believed in the God of Israel. His residence at Caesrea probably brought him into contact with Jews who communicated to him their expectations regarding the Messiah; and thus he was prepared to welcome the message Peter brought him. He became the first fruit of the Gentile world to Christ. He and his family were baptized and admitted into the Christian church (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 10:1, 44-48</reflink>). (<see target="x-self">See CENTURION.</see>)</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Corner">
    <description>The angle of a house (<reflink target="XXX">Job 1:19</reflink>) or a street (<reflink target="XXX">Prov. 7:8</reflink>). "Corners" in Neh. 9:22 denotes the various districts of the promised land allotted to the Israelites. In Num. 24:17, the "corners of Moab" denotes the whole land of Moab. The "corner of a field" (<reflink target="XXX">Lev. 19:9; 23:22</reflink>) is its extreme part, which was not to be reaped. The Jews were prohibited from cutting the "corners," i.e., the extremities, of the hair and whiskers running round the ears (<reflink target="XXX">Lev. 19:27; 21:5</reflink>). The "four corners of the earth" in Isa. 11:12 and Ezek. 7:2 denotes the whole land. The "corners of the streets" mentioned in Matt. 6:5 means the angles where streets meet so as to form a square or place of public resort.</description>
    <description>The corner gate of Jerusalem (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 14:13; 2 Chr. 26:9</reflink>) was on the north-west side of the city.</description>
    <description>Corner-stone (<reflink target="XXX">Job 38:6; Isa. 28:16</reflink>), a block of great importance in binding together the sides of a building. The "head of the corner" (<reflink target="XXX">Ps. 118:22, 23</reflink>) denotes the coping, the "coign of vantage", i.e., the topstone of a building. But the word "corner stone" is sometimes used to denote some person of rank and importance (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 28:16</reflink>). It is applied to our Lord, who was set in highest honour (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 21:42</reflink>). He is also styled "the chief corner stone" (<reflink target="XXX">Eph. 2:20; 1 Pet. 2:6-8</reflink>). When Zechariah (10:4), speaking of Judah, says, "Out of him came forth the corner," he is probably to be understood as ultimately referring to the Messiah as the "corner stone." (See TEMPLE, SOLOMON'S</description>

  <item id="Cornet">
    <description>Heb. shophar, "brightness," with reference to the clearness of its sound (<reflink target="XXX">1 Chr. 15:28; 2 Chr. 15:14; Ps. 98:6; Hos. 5:8</reflink>). It is usually rendered in the Authorized Version "trumpet." It denotes the long and straight horn, about eighteen inches long. The words of Joel, "Blow the trumpet," literally, "Sound the cornet," refer to the festival which was the preparation for the day of Atonement. In Dan. 3:5, 7, 10, 15, the word (keren) so rendered is a curved horn. The word "cornet" in 2 Sam. 6:5 (Heb. mena'an'im, occurring only here) was some kind of instrument played by being shaken like the Egyptian sistrum, consisting of rings or bells hung loosely on iron rods.</description>

  <item id="Cotes">
    <description>pens or enclosures for flocks (<reflink target="XXX">2 Chr. 32:28, "cotes for flocks;" R.V., "flocks in folds"</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Cottage">
    <description>(1.) A booth in a vineyard (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 1:8</reflink>); a temporary shed covered with leaves or straw to shelter the watchman that kept the garden. These were slight fabrics, and were removed when no longer needed, or were left to be blown down in winter (<reflink target="XXX">Job 27:18</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(2.) A lodging-place (rendered "lodge" in Isa. 1:8); a slighter structure than the "booth," as the cucumber patch is more temporary than a vineyard (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 24:20</reflink>). It denotes a frail structure of boughs supported on a few poles, which is still in use in the East, or a hammock suspended between trees, in which the watchman was accustomed to sleep during summer.</description>
    <description>(3.) In Zeph. 2:6 it is the rendering of the Hebrew _keroth_, which some suppose to denote rather "pits" (R.V. marg., "caves") or "wells of water," such as shepherds would sink.</description>

    <description>(<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 13:20, 21</reflink>), an agricultural instrument, elsewhere called "ploughshare" (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 2:4; Micah 4:3; Joel 3:10</reflink>). It was the facing-piece of a plough, analogous to the modern coulter.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Council">
    <description>spoken of counsellors who sat in public trials with the governor of a province (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 25:12</reflink>).</description>
    <description>The Jewish councils were the Sanhedrim, or supreme council of the nation, which had subordinate to it smaller tribunals (the "judgment," perhaps, in Matt. 5:21, 22) in the cities of Palestine (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 10:17; Mark 13:9</reflink>). In the time of Christ the functions of the Sanhedrim were limited (<reflink target="XXX">John 16:2; 2 Cor. 11:24</reflink>). In Ps. 68:27 the word "council" means simply a company of persons. (R.V. marg., "company.")</description>
    <description>In ecclesiastical history the word is used to denote an assembly of pastors or bishops for the discussion and regulation of church affairs. The first of these councils was that of the apostles and elders at Jerusalem, of which we have a detailed account in Acts 15.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Counsellor">
    <description>an adviser (<reflink target="XXX">Prov. 11:14; 15:22</reflink>), a king's state counsellor (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 15:12</reflink>). Used once of the Messiah (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 9:6</reflink>). In Mark 15:43, Luke 23:50, the word probably means a member of the Jewish Sanhedrim.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Courses">
    <description>When David was not permitted to build the temple, he proceeded, among the last acts of his life, with the assistance of Zadok and Ahimelech, to organize the priestly and musical services to be conducted in the house of God. (1.) He divided the priests into twenty-four courses (<reflink target="XXX">1 Chr. 24:1-19</reflink>), sixteen being of the house of Eleazar and eight of that of Ithamar. Each course was under a head or chief, and ministered for a week, the order being determined by lot. (2.) The rest of the 38,000 Levites (23:4) were divided also into twenty-four courses, each to render some allotted service in public worship: 4,000 in twenty-four courses were set apart as singers and musicians under separate leaders (25); 4,000 as porters or keepers of the doors and gates of the sanctuary (26:1-19); and 6,000 as officers and judges to see to the administration of the law in all civil and ecclesiastical matters (20-32).</description>
    <description>This arrangement was re-established by Hezekiah (<reflink target="XXX">2 Chr. 31:2</reflink>); and afterwards the four sacerdotal courses which are said to have returned from the Captivity were re-divided into the original number of twenty-four by Ezra (6:18).</description>

  </item>
  <item id="Covenant">
    <description>a contract or agreement between two parties. In the Old Testament the Hebrew word _berith_ is always thus translated. _Berith_ is derived from a root which means "to cut," and hence a covenant is a "cutting," with reference to the cutting or dividing of animals into two parts, and the contracting parties passing between them, in making a covenant (Gen. 15; Jer. 34:18, 19).</description>
    <description>The corresponding word in the New Testament Greek is _diatheke_, which is, however, rendered "testament" generally in the Authorized Version. It ought to be rendered, just as the word _berith_ of the Old Testament, "covenant."</description>
    <description>This word is used (1) of a covenant or compact between man and man (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 21:32</reflink>), or between tribes or nations (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 11:1; Josh. 9:6, 15</reflink>). In entering into a convenant, Jehovah was solemnly called on to witness the transaction (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 31:50</reflink>), and hence it was called a "covenant of the Lord" (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 20:8</reflink>). The marriage compact is called "the covenant of God" (<reflink target="XXX">Prov. 2:17</reflink>), because the marriage was made in God's name. Wicked men are spoken of as acting as if they had made a "covenant with death" not to destroy them, or with hell not to devour them (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 28:15, 18</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(2.) The word is used with reference to God's revelation of himself in the way of promise or of favour to men. Thus God's promise to Noah after the Flood is called a covenant (Gen. 9; Jer. 33:20, "my covenant"). We have an account of God's covernant with Abraham (Gen. 17, comp. Lev. 26:42), of the covenant of the priesthood (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 25:12, 13; Deut. 33:9; Neh. 13:29</reflink>), and of the covenant of Sinai (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 34:27, 28; Lev. 26:15</reflink>), which was afterwards renewed at different times in the history of Israel (Deut. 29; Josh. 1:24; 2 Chr. 15; 23; 29; 34; Ezra 10; Neh. 9). In conformity with human custom, God's covenant is said to be confirmed with an oath (<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 4:31; Ps. 89:3</reflink>), and to be accompanied by a sign (Gen. 9; 17). Hence the covenant is called God's "counsel," "oath," "promise" (<reflink target="XXX">Ps. 89:3, 4; 105:8-11; Heb. 6:13-20; Luke 1:68-75</reflink>). God's covenant consists wholly in the bestowal of blessing (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 59:21; Jer. 31:33, 34</reflink>).</description>
    <description>The term covenant is also used to designate the regular succession of day and night (<reflink target="XXX">Jer. 33:20</reflink>), the Sabbath (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 31:16</reflink>), circumcision (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 17:9, 10</reflink>), and in general any ordinance of God (<reflink target="XXX">Jer. 34:13, 14</reflink>).</description>
    <description>A "covenant of salt" signifies an everlasting covenant, in the sealing or ratifying of which salt, as an emblem of perpetuity, is used (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 18:19; Lev. 2:13; 2 Chr. 13:5</reflink>).</description>
    <description>COVENANT OF WORKS, the constitution under which Adam was placed at his creation. In this covenant, (1.) The contracting parties were (a) God the moral Governor, and (b) Adam, a free moral agent, and representative of all his natural posterity (<reflink target="XXX">Rom. 5:12-19</reflink>). (2.) The promise was "life" (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 19:16, 17; Gal. 3:12</reflink>). (3.) The condition was perfect obedience to the law, the test in this case being abstaining from eating the fruit of the "tree of knowledge," etc. (4.) The penalty was death (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 2:16, 17</reflink>).</description>
    <description>This covenant is also called a covenant of nature, as made with man in his natural or unfallen state; a covenant of life, because "life" was the promise attached to obedience; and a legal covenant, because it demanded perfect obedience to the law.</description>
    <description>The "tree of life" was the outward sign and seal of that life which was promised in the covenant, and hence it is usually called the seal of that covenant.</description>
    <description>This covenant is abrogated under the gospel, inasmuch as Christ has fulfilled all its conditions in behalf of his people, and now offers salvation on the condition of faith. It is still in force, however, as it rests on the immutable justice of God, and is binding on all who have not fled to Christ and accepted his righteousness.</description>
    <description>CONVENANT OF GRACE, the eternal plan of redemption entered into by the three persons of the Godhead, and carried out by them in its several parts. In it the Father represented the Godhead in its indivisible sovereignty, and the Son his people as their surety (<reflink target="XXX">John 17:4, 6, 9; Isa. 42:6; Ps. 89:3</reflink>).</description>
    <description>The conditions of this covenant were, (1.) On the part of the Father (a) all needful preparation to the Son for the accomplishment of his work (<reflink target="XXX">Heb. 10:5; Isa. 42:1-7</reflink>); (b) support in the work (<reflink target="XXX">Luke 22:43</reflink>); and (c) a glorious reward in the exaltation of Christ when his work was done (<reflink target="XXX">Phil. 2:6-11</reflink>), his investiture with universal dominion (<reflink target="XXX">John 5:22; Ps. 110:1</reflink>), his having the administration of the covenant committed into his hands (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 28:18; John 1:12; 17:2; Acts 2:33</reflink>), and in the final salvation of all his people (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 35:10; 53:10, 11; Jer. 31:33; Titus 1:2</reflink>). (2.) On the part of the Son the conditions were (a) his becoming incarnate (<reflink target="XXX">Gal. 4:4, 5</reflink>); and (b) as the second Adam his representing all his people, assuming their place and undertaking all their obligations under the violated covenant of works; (c) obeying the law (<reflink target="XXX">Ps. 40:8; Isa. 42:21; John 9:4, 5</reflink>), and (d) suffering its penalty (Isa. 53; 2 Cor. 5:21; Gal. 3:13), in their stead.</description>
    <description>Christ, the mediator of, fulfils all its conditions in behalf of his people, and dispenses to them all its blessings. In Heb. 8:6; 9:15; 12:24, this title is given to Christ. (<see target="x-self">See DISPENSATION.</see>)</description>

  <item id="Covering of the eyes">
    <description>occurs only in Gen. 20:16. In the Revised Version the rendering is "it (i.e., Abimelech's present of 1,000 pieces of silver to Abraham) is for thee a covering of the eyes." This has been regarded as an implied advice to Sarah to conform to the custom of married women, and wear a complete veil, covering the eyes as well as the rest of the face.</description>

  <item id="Covetousness">
    <description>a strong desire after the possession of worldly things (<reflink target="XXX">Col. 3:5; Eph. 5:5; Heb. 13:5; 1 Tim. 6:9, 10; Matt. 6:20</reflink>). It assumes sometimes the more aggravated form of avarice, which is the mark of cold-hearted worldliness.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Cow">
    <description>A cow and her calf were not to be killed on the same day (<reflink target="XXX">Lev. 22:28; Ex. 23:19; Deut. 22:6, 7</reflink>). The reason for this enactment is not given. A state of great poverty is described in the words of Isa. 7:21-25, where, instead of possessing great resources, a man shall depend for the subsistence of himself and his family on what a single cow and two sheep could yield.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Crane">
    <description>(<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 38:14; Jer. 8:7</reflink>). In both of these passages the Authorized Version has reversed the Hebrew order of the words. "Crane or swallow" should be "swallow or crane," as in the Revised Version. The rendering is there correct. The Hebrew for crane is _'agur_, the Grus cincerea, a bird well known in Palestine. It is migratory, and is distinguished by its loud voice, its cry being hoarse and melancholy.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Creation">
    <description>"In the beginning" God created, i.e., called into being, all things out of nothing. This creative act on the part of God was absolutely free, and for infinitely wise reasons. The cause of all things exists only in the will of God. The work of creation is attributed (1) to the Godhead (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 1:1, 26</reflink>); (2) to the Father (<reflink target="XXX">1 Cor. 8:6</reflink>); (3) to the Son (<reflink target="XXX">John 1:3; Col. 1:16, 17</reflink>); (4) to the Holy Spirit (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 1:2; Job 26:13; Ps. 104:30</reflink>). The fact that he is the Creator distinguishes Jehovah as the true God (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 37:16; 40:12, 13; 54:5; Ps. 96:5; Jer. 10:11, 12</reflink>). The one great end in the work of creation is the manifestation of the glory of the Creator (<reflink target="XXX">Col. 1:16; Rev. 4:11; Rom. 11:36</reflink>). God's works, equally with God's word, are a revelation from him; and between the teachings of the one and those of the other, when rightly understood, there can be no contradiction.</description>

  <item id="Crete">
    <description>now called Candia, one of the largest islands in the Meditterranean, about 140 miles long and 35 broad. It was at one time a very prosperous and populous island, having a "hundred cities." The character of the people is described in Paul's quotation from "one of their own poets" (Epimenides) in his epistle to Titus: "The Cretans are alway liars, evil beasts, slow bellies" (<reflink target="XXX">Titus 1:12</reflink>). Jews from Crete were in Jerusalem on the day of Pentecost (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 2:11</reflink>). The island was visited by Paul on his voyage to Rome (Acts 27). Here Paul subsequently left Titus (1:5) "to ordain elders." Some have supposed that it was the original home of the Caphtorim (q.v.) or Philistines.</description>

  <item id="Cross">
    <description>in the New Testament the instrument of crucifixion, and hence used for the crucifixion of Christ itself (<reflink target="XXX">Eph. 2:16; Heb. 12:2; 1 Cor. 1:17, 18; Gal. 5:11; 6:12, 14; Phil. 3:18</reflink>). The word is also used to denote any severe affliction or trial (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 10:38; 16:24; Mark 8:34; 10:21</reflink>).</description>
    <description>The forms in which the cross is represented are these:</description>
    <description>1. The crux simplex (I), a "single piece without transom."</description>
    <description>2. The crux decussata (X), or St. Andrew's cross.</description>
    <description>3. The crux commissa (T), or St. Anthony's cross.</description>
    <description>4. The crux immissa (t), or Latin cross, which was the kind of cross on which our Saviour died. Above our Lord's head, on the projecting beam, was placed the "title." (See CRUCIFIXION</description>
    <description>After the conversion, so-called, of Constantine the Great (B.C. 313), the cross first came into use as an emblem of Christianity. He pretended at a critical moment that he saw a flaming cross in the heavens bearing the inscription, "In hoc signo vinces", i.e., By this sign thou shalt conquer, and that on the following night Christ himself appeared and ordered him to take for his standard the sign of this cross. In this form a new standard, called the Labarum, was accordingly made, and borne by the Roman armies. It remained the standard of the Roman army till the downfall of the Western empire. It bore the embroidered monogram of Christ, i.e., the first two Greek letters of his name, X and P (chi and rho), with the Alpha and Omega. (<see target="x-self">See A.</see>)</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Crown">
    <description>(1.) Denotes the plate of gold in the front of the high priest's mitre (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 29:6; 39:30</reflink>). The same Hebrew word so rendered (ne'zer) denotes the diadem worn by Saul in battle (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 1:10</reflink>), and also that which was used at the coronation of Joash (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 11:12</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(2.) The more general name in Hebrew for a crown is _'atarah_, meaning a "circlet." This is used of crowns and head ornaments of divers kinds, including royal crowns. Such was the crown taken from the king of Ammon by David (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 12:30</reflink>). The crown worn by the Assyrian kings was a high mitre, sometimes adorned with flowers. There are sculptures also representing the crowns worn by the early Egyptian and Persian kings. Sometimes a diadem surrounded the royal head-dress of two or three fillets. This probably signified that the wearer had dominion over two or three countries. In Rev. 12:3; 13:1, we read of "many crowns," a token of extended dominion.</description>
    <description>(3.) The ancient Persian crown (<reflink target="XXX">Esther 1:11; 2:17; 6:8</reflink>) was called _kether_; i.e., "a chaplet," a high cap or tiara. Crowns were worn sometimes to represent honour and power (<reflink target="XXX">Ezek. 23:42</reflink>). They were worn at marriages (<reflink target="XXX">Cant. 3:11; Isa. 61:10, "ornaments;" R.V., "a garland"</reflink>), and at feasts and public festivals.</description>
    <description>The crown was among the Romans and Greeks a symbol of victory and reward. The crown or wreath worn by the victors in the Olympic games was made of leaves of the wild olive; in the Pythian games, of laurel; in the Nemean games, of parsley; and in the Isthmian games, of the pine. The Romans bestowed the "civic crown" on him who saved the life of a citizen. It was made of the leaves of the oak. In opposition to all these fading crowns the apostles speak of the incorruptible crown, the crown of life (<reflink target="XXX">James 1:12; Rev. 2:10</reflink>) "that fadeth not away" (<reflink target="XXX">1 Pet. 5:4, Gr. amarantinos; comp. 1:4</reflink>). Probably the word "amaranth" was applied to flowers we call "everlasting," the "immortal amaranth."</description>

  <item id="Crown of thorns">
    <description>our Lord was crowned with a, in mockery by the Romans (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 27:29</reflink>). The object of Pilate's guard in doing this was probably to insult, and not specially to inflict pain. There is nothing to show that the shrub thus used was, as has been supposed, the spina Christi, which could have been easily woven into a wreath. It was probably the thorny nabk, which grew abundantly round about Jerusalem, and whose flexible, pliant, and round branches could easily be platted into the form of a crown. (<see target="x-self">See THORN , 3.</see>)</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Crucifixion">
    <description>a common mode of punishment among heathen nations in early times. It is not certain whether it was known among the ancient Jews; probably it was not. The modes of capital punishment according to the Mosaic law were, by the sword (Ex. 21), strangling, fire (Lev. 20), and stoning (Deut. 21).</description>
    <description>This was regarded as the most horrible form of death, and to a Jew it would acquire greater horror from the curse in Deut. 21:23.</description>
    <description>This punishment began by subjecting the sufferer to scourging. In the case of our Lord, however, his scourging was rather before the sentence was passed upon him, and was inflicted by Pilate for the purpose, probably, of exciting pity and procuring his escape from further punishment (<reflink target="XXX">Luke 23:22; John 19:1</reflink>).</description>
    <description>The condemned one carried his own cross to the place of execution, which was outside the city, in some conspicuous place set apart for the purpose. Before the nailing to the cross took place, a medicated cup of vinegar mixed with gall and myrrh (the sopor) was given, for the purpose of deadening the pangs of the sufferer. Our Lord refused this cup, that his senses might be clear (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 27:34</reflink>). The spongeful of vinegar, sour wine, posca, the common drink of the Roman soldiers, which was put on a hyssop stalk and offered to our Lord in contemptuous pity (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 27:48; Luke 23:36</reflink>), he tasted to allay the agonies of his thirst (<reflink target="XXX">John 19:29</reflink>). The accounts given of the crucifixion of our Lord are in entire agreement with the customs and practices of the Roman in such cases. He was crucified between two "malefactors" (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 53:12; Luke 23:32</reflink>), and was watched by a party of four soldiers (<reflink target="XXX">John 19:23; Matt. 27:36, 54</reflink>), with their centurion. The "breaking of the legs" of the malefactors was intended to hasten death, and put them out of misery (<reflink target="XXX">John 19:31</reflink>); but the unusual rapidity of our Lord's death (19:33) was due to his previous sufferings and his great mental anguish. The omission of the breaking of his legs was the fulfilment of a type (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 12:46</reflink>). He literally died of a broken heart, a ruptured heart, and hence the flowing of blood and water from the wound made by the soldier's spear (<reflink target="XXX">John 19:34</reflink>). Our Lord uttered seven memorable words from the cross, namely, (1) Luke 23:34; (2) 23:43; (3) John 19:26; (4) Matt. 27:46, Mark 15:34; (5) John 19:28; (6) 19:30; (7) Luke 23:46.</description>

    <description>a utensil; a flask or cup for holding water (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 26:11, 12, 16; 1 Kings 19:6</reflink>) or oil (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 17:12, 14, 16</reflink>). In 1 Kings 14:3 the word there so rendered means properly a bottle, as in Jer. 19:1, 10, or pitcher. In 2 Kings 2:20, a platter or flat metal saucer is intended. The Hebrew word here used is translated "dish" in 21:13; "pans," in 2 Chr. 35:13; and "bosom," in Prov. 19:24; 26:15 (R.V., "dish").</description>

    <description>(<reflink target="XXX">Ezek. 1:22, with the epithet "terrible," as dazzling the spectators with its brightness</reflink>). The word occurs in Rev. 4:6; 21:11; 22:1. It is a stone of the flint order, the most refined kind of quartz. The Greek word here used means also literally "ice." The ancients regarded the crystal as only pure water congealed into extreme hardness by great length of time.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Cubit">
    <description>Heb. 'ammah; i.e., "mother of the arm," the fore-arm, is a word derived from the Latin cubitus, the lower arm. It is difficult to determine the exact length of this measure, from the uncertainty whether it included the entire length from the elbow to the tip of the longest finger, or only from the elbow to the root of the hand at the wrist. The probability is that the longer was the original cubit. The common computation as to the length of the cubit makes it 20.24 inches for the ordinary cubit, and 21.888 inches for the sacred one. This is the same as the Egyptian measurements.</description>
    <description>A rod or staff the measure of a cubit is called in Judg. 3:16 _gomed_, which literally means a "cut," something "cut off." The LXX. and Vulgate render it "span."</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Cuckoo">
    <description>(Heb. shahaph), from a root meaning "to be lean; slender." This bird is mentioned only in Lev. 11:16 and Deut. 14:15 (R.V., "seamew"). Some have interpreted the Hebrew word by "petrel" or "shearwater" (Puffinus cinereus), which is found on the coast of Syria; others think it denotes the "sea-gull" or "seamew." The common cuckoo (Cuculus canorus) feeds on reptiles and large insects. It is found in Asia and Africa as well as in Europe. It only passes the winter in Palestine. The Arabs suppose it to utter the cry _Yakub_, and hence they call it _tir el-Yakub_; i.e., "Jacob's bird."</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Cucumbers">
    <description>(Heb. plur. kishshuim; i.e., "hard," "difficult" of digestion, only in Num. 11:5). This vegetable is extensively cultivated in the East at the present day, as it appears to have been in earlier times among the Hebrews. It belongs to the gourd family of plants. In the East its cooling pulp and juice are most refreshing. "We need not altogether wonder that the Israelites, wearily marching through the arid solitudes of the Sinaitic peninsula, thought more of the cucumbers and watermelons of which they had had no lack in Egypt, rather than of the cruel bondage which was the price of these luxuries." Groser's Scripture Natural History.</description>
    <description>Isaiah speaks of a "lodge" (1:8; Heb. sukkah), i.e., a shed or edifice more solid than a booth, for the protection throughout the season from spring to autumn of the watchers in a "garden of cucumbers."</description>

    <description>(Heb. kammon; i.e., a "condiment"), the fruit or seed of an umbelliferous plant, the Cuminum sativum, still extensively cultivated in the East. Its fruit is mentioned in Isa. 28:25, 27. In the New Testament it is mentioned in Matt. 23:23, where our Lord pronounces a "woe" on the scribes and Pharisees, who were zealous in paying tithes of "mint and anise and cummin," while they omitted the weightier matters of the law." "It is used as a spice, both bruised, to mix with bread, and also boiled, in the various messes and stews which compose an Oriental banquet." Tristram, Natural History.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Cup">
    <description>a wine-cup (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 40:11, 21</reflink>), various forms of which are found on Assyrian and Egyptian monuments. All Solomon's drinking vessels were of gold (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 10: 21</reflink>). The cups mentioned in the New Testament were made after Roman and Greek models, and were sometimes of gold (<reflink target="XXX">Rev. 17:4</reflink>).</description>
    <description>The art of divining by means of a cup was practiced in Egypt (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 44:2-17</reflink>), and in the East generally.</description>
    <description>The "cup of salvation" (<reflink target="XXX">Ps. 116:13</reflink>) is the cup of thanksgiving for the great salvation. The "cup of consolation" (<reflink target="XXX">Jer. 16:7</reflink>) refers to the custom of friends sending viands and wine to console relatives in mourning (<reflink target="XXX">Prov. 31:6</reflink>). In 1 Cor. 10:16, the "cup of blessing" is contrasted with the "cup of devils" (<reflink target="XXX">1 Cor. 10:21</reflink>). The sacramental cup is the "cup of blessing," because of blessing pronounced over it (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 26:27; Luke 22:17</reflink>). The "portion of the cup" (<reflink target="XXX">Ps. 11:6; 16:5</reflink>) denotes one's condition of life, prosperous or adverse. A "cup" is also a type of sensual allurement (<reflink target="XXX">Jer. 51:7; Prov. 23:31; Rev. 17:4</reflink>). We read also of the "cup of astonishment," the "cup of trembling," and the "cup of God's wrath" (<reflink target="XXX">Ps. 75:8; Isa. 51:17; Jer. 25:15; Lam. 4:21; Ezek. 23:32; Rev. 16:19; comp. Matt. 26:39, 42; John 18:11</reflink>). The cup is also the symbol of death (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 16:28; Mark 9:1; Heb. 2:9</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Cup-bearer">
    <description>an officer of high rank with Egyptian, Persian, Assyrian, and Jewish monarchs. The cup-bearer of the king of Egypt is mentioned in connection with Joseph's history (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 40:1-21; 41:9</reflink>). Rabshakeh (q.v.) was cup-bearer in the Assyrian court (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 18:17</reflink>). Nehemiah filled this office to the king of Persia (<reflink target="XXX">Neh. 1:11</reflink>). We read also of Solomon's cup-bearers (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 10:5; 2 Chr. 9:4</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Curious arts">
    <description>(<reflink target="XXX">Acts 19:19</reflink>), magical arts; jugglery practised by the Ephesian conjurers. Ephesus was noted for its wizard and the "Ephesian spells;" i.e., charms or scraps of parchment written over with certain formula, which were worn as a safeguard against all manner of evils. The more important and powerful of these charms were written out in books which circulated among the exorcists, and were sold at a great price.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Curse">
    <description>denounced by God against the serpent (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 3:14</reflink>), and against Cain (4:11). These divine maledictions carried their effect with them. Prophetical curses were sometimes pronounced by holy men (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 9:25; 49:7; Deut. 27:15; Josh. 6:26</reflink>). Such curses are not the consequence of passion or revenge, they are predictions.</description>
    <description>No one on pain of death shall curse father or mother (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 21:17</reflink>), nor the prince of his people (22:28), nor the deaf (<reflink target="XXX">Lev. 19:14</reflink>). Cursing God or blaspheming was punishable by death (<reflink target="XXX">Lev. 24:10-16</reflink>). The words "curse God and die" (R.V., "renounce God and die"), used by Job's wife (<reflink target="XXX">Job 2:9</reflink>), have been variously interpreted. Perhaps they simply mean that as nothing but death was expected, God would by this cursing at once interpose and destroy Job, and so put an end to his sufferings.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Curtain">
    <description>(1.) Ten curtains, each twenty-eight cubits long and four wide, made of fine linen, also eleven made of goat's hair, covered the tabernacle (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 26:1-13; 36:8-17</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(2.) The sacred curtain, separating the holy of holies from the sanctuary, is designated by a different Hebrew word (peroketh). It is described as a "veil of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen of cunning work" (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 26:31; Lev. 16:2; Num. 18:7</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(3.) "Stretcheth out the heavens as a curtain" (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 40:22</reflink>), is an expression used with reference to the veil or awning which Orientals spread for a screen over their courts in summer. According to the prophet, the heavens are spread over our heads as such an awning. Similar expressions are found in Ps. 104:2l; comp. Isa. 44:24; Job 9:8.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Cush">
    <description>black. (1.) A son, probably the eldest, of Ham, and the father of Nimrod (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 10:8; 1 Chr. 1:10</reflink>). From him the land of Cush seems to have derived its name. The question of the precise locality of the land of Cush has given rise to not a little controversy. The second river of Paradise surrounded the whole land of Cush (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 2:13, R.V.</reflink>). The term Cush is in the Old Testament generally applied to the countries south of the Israelites. It was the southern limit of Egypt (<reflink target="XXX">Ezek. 29:10, A.V. "Ethiopia," Heb. Cush</reflink>), with which it is generally associated (<reflink target="XXX">Ps. 68:31; Isa. 18:1; Jer. 46:9, etc.</reflink>). It stands also associated with Elam (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 11:11</reflink>), with Persia (<reflink target="XXX">Ezek. 38:5</reflink>), and with the Sabeans (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 45:14</reflink>). From these facts it has been inferred that Cush included Arabia and the country on the west coast of the Red Sea. Rawlinson takes it to be the country still known as Khuzi-stan, on the east side of the Lower Tigris. But there are intimations which warrant the conclusion that there was also a Cush in Africa, the Ethiopia (so called by the Greeks) of Africa. Ezekiel speaks (29:10; comp. 30:4-6) of it as lying south of Egypt. It was the country now known to us as Nubia and Abyssinia (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 18:1; Zeph. 3:10, Heb. Cush</reflink>). In ancient Egyptian inscriptions Ethiopia is termed _Kesh_. The Cushites appear to have spread along extensive tracts, stretching from the Upper Nile to the Euphrates and Tigris. At an early period there was a stream of migration of Cushites "from Ethiopia, properly so called, through Arabia, Babylonia, and Persia, to Western India." The Hamite races, soon after their arrival in Africa, began to spread north, east, and west. Three branches of the Cushite or Ethiopian stock, moving from Western Asia, settled in the regions contiguous to the Persian Gulf. One branch, called the Cossaeans, settled in the mountainous district on the east of the Tigris, known afterwards as Susiana; another occupied the lower regions of the Euphrates and the Tigris; while a third colonized the southern shores and islands of the gulf, whence they afterwards emigrated to the Mediterranean and settled on the coast of Palestine as the Phoenicians. Nimrod was a great Cushite chief. He conquered the Accadians, a Tauranian race, already settled in Mesopotamia, and founded his kingdom, the Cushites mingling with the Accads, and so forming the Chaldean nation.</description>
    <description>(2.) A Benjamite of this name is mentioned in the title of Ps. 7. "Cush was probably a follower of Saul, the head of his tribe, and had sought the friendship of David for the purpose of 'rewarding evil to him that was at peace with him.'"</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Cushan">
    <description>probably a poetic or prolonged name of the land of Cush, the Arabian Cush (<reflink target="XXX">Hab. 3:7</reflink>). Some have, however, supposed this to be the same as Chushan-rishathaim (<reflink target="XXX">Judg. 3:8, 10</reflink>), i.e., taking the latter part of the name as a title or local appellation, Chushan "of the two iniquities" (= oppressing Israel, and provoking them to idolatry), a Mesopotamian king, identified by Rawlinson with Asshur-ris-ilim (the father of Tiglathpileser I.); but incorrectly, for the empire of Assyria was not yet founded. He held Israel in bondage for eight years.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Cushite">
    <description>(1.) The messenger sent by Joab to David to announce his victory over Absalom (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 18:32</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(2.) The father of Shelemiah (<reflink target="XXX">Jer. 36:14</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(3.) Son of Gedaliah, and father of the prophet Zephaniah (1:1).</description>
    <description>(4.) Moses married a Cushite woman (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 12:1</reflink>). From this circumstance some have supposed that Zipporah was meant, and hence that Midian was Cush.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Custom">
    <description>a tax imposed by the Romans. The tax-gatherers were termed publicans (q.v.), who had their stations at the gates of cities, and in the public highways, and at the place set apart for that purpose, called the "receipt of custom" (<reflink target="XXX">Matt.9: 9; Mark 2:14</reflink>), where they collected the money that was to be paid on certain goods (<reflink target="XXX">Matt.17:25</reflink>). These publicans were tempted to exact more from the people than was lawful, and were, in consequence of their extortions, objects of great hatred. The Pharisees would have no intercourse with them (<reflink target="XXX">Matt.5:46, 47; 9:10, 11</reflink>).</description>
    <description>A tax or tribute (q.v.) of half a shekel was annually paid by every adult Jew for the temple. It had to be paid in Jewish coin (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 22:17-19; Mark 12:14, 15</reflink>). Money-changers (q.v.) were necessary, to enable the Jews who came up to Jerusalem at the feasts to exchange their foreign coin for Jewish money; but as it was forbidden by the law to carry on such a traffic for emolument (<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 23:19, 20</reflink>), our Lord drove them from the temple (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 21:12: Mark 11:15</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Cuthah">
    <description>one of the Babylonian cities or districts from which Shalmaneser transplanted certain colonists to Samaria (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 17:24</reflink>). Some have conjectured that the "Cutheans" were identical with the "Cossaeans" who inhabited the hill-country to the north of the river Choaspes. Cuthah is now identified with Tell Ibrahim, 15 miles north-east of Babylon.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Cutting">
    <description>the flesh in various ways was an idolatrous practice, a part of idol-worship (<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 14:1; 1 Kings 18:28</reflink>). The Israelites were commanded not to imitate this practice (<reflink target="XXX">Lev. 19:28; 21:5; Deut. 14:1</reflink>). The tearing of the flesh from grief and anguish of spirit in mourning for the dead was regarded as a mark of affection (<reflink target="XXX">Jer. 16:6; 41:5; 48:37</reflink>).</description>
    <description>Allusions are made in Revelation (13:16; 17:5; 19:20) to the practice of printing marks on the body, to indicate allegiance to a deity. We find also references to it, through in a different direction, by Paul (Gal. 6; 7) and by Ezekiel (9:4). (<see target="x-self">See HAIR.</see>)</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Cymbals">
    <description>(Heb. tzeltzelim, from a root meaning to "tinkle"), musical instruments, consisting of two convex pieces of brass one held in each hand, which were clashed together to produce a loud clanging sound; castanets; "loud cymbals." "Highsounding cymbals" consisted of two larger plates, one held also in each hand (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 6:5; Ps. 150:5; 1 Chr. 13:8; 15:16, 19, 28; 1 Cor. 13:1</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Cypress">
    <description>(Heb. tirzah, "hardness"), mentioned only in Isa. 44:14 (R.V., "holm tree"). The oldest Latin version translates this word by ilex, i.e., the evergreen oak, which may possibly have been the tree intended; but there is great probability that our Authorized Version is correct in rendering it "cypress." This tree grows abundantly on the mountains of Hermon. Its wood is hard and fragrant, and very durable. Its foliage is dark and gloomy. It is an evergreen (Cupressus sempervirens). "Throughout the East it is used as a funereal tree; and its dark, tall, waving plumes render it peculiarly appropriate among the tombs."</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Cyprus">
    <description>one of the largest islands of the Mediterranean, about 148 miles long and 40 broad. It is distant about 60 miles from the Syrian coast. It was the "Chittim" of the Old Testament (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 24:24</reflink>). The Greek colonists gave it the name of Kypros, from the cyprus, i.e., the henna (<see target="x-self">see CAMPHIRE</see>), which grew on this island. It was originally inhabited by Phoenicians. In B.C. 477 it fell under the dominion of the Greeks; and became a Roman province B.C. 58. In ancient times it was a centre of great commercial activity. Corn and wine and oil were produced here in the greatest perfection. It was rich also in timber and in mineral wealth.</description>
    <description>It is first mentioned in the New Testament (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 4:36</reflink>) as the native place of Barnabas. It was the scene of Paul's first missionary labours (13:4-13), when he and Barnabas and John Mark were sent forth by the church of Antioch. It was afterwards visited by Barnabas and Mark alone (15:39). Mnason, an "old disciple," probaly one of the converts of the day of Pentecost belonging to this island, is mentioned (21:16). It is also mentioned in connection with the voyages of Paul (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 21:3; 27:4</reflink>). After being under the Turks for three hundred years, it was given up to the British Government in 1878.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Cyrene">
    <description>a city (now Tripoli) in Upper Libya, North Africa, founded by a colony of Greeks (B.C. 630). It contained latterly a large number of Jews, who were introduced into the city by Ptolemy, the son of Lagus, because he thought they would contribute to the security of the place. They increased in number and influence; and we are thus prepared for the frequent references to them in connection with the early history of Christianity. Simon, who bore our Lord's cross, was a native of this place (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 27:32; Mark 15:21</reflink>). Jews from Cyrene were in Jerusalem at Pentecost (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 2:10</reflink>); and Cyrenian Jews had a synagogue at Jerusalem (6:9). Converts belonging to Cyrene contributed to the formation of the first Gentile church at Antioch (11:20). Among "the prophets and teachers" who "ministered to the Lord at Antioch" was Lucius of Cyrene (13:1).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Cyrenius">
    <description>the Grecized form of Quirinus. His full name was Publius Sulpicius Quirinus. Recent historical investigation has proved that Quirinus was governor of Cilicia, which was annexed to Syria at the time of our Lord's birth. Cilicia, which he ruled, being a province of Syria, he is called the governor, which he was de jure, of Syria. Some ten years afterwards he was appointed governor of Syria for the second time. During his tenure of office, at the time of our Lord's birth (<reflink target="XXX">Luke 2:2</reflink>), a "taxing" (R.V., "enrolment;" i.e., a registration) of the people was "first made;" i.e., was made for the first time under his government. (<see target="x-self">See TAXING.</see>)</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Cyrus">
    <description>(Heb. Ko'resh), the celebrated "King of Persia" (Elam) who was conqueror of Babylon, and issued the decree of liberation to the Jews (<reflink target="XXX">Ezra 1:1, 2</reflink>). He was the son of Cambyses, the prince of Persia, and was born about B.C. 599. In the year B.C. 559 he became king of Persia, the kingdom of Media being added to it partly by conquest. Cyrus was a great military leader, bent on universal conquest. Babylon fell before his army (B.C. 538) on the night of Belshazzar's feast (<reflink target="XXX">Dan. 5:30</reflink>), and then the ancient dominion of Assyria was also added to his empire (cf., "Go up, O Elam", Isa.21:2).</description>
    <description>Hitherto the great kings of the earth had only oppressed the Jews. Cyrus was to them as a "shepherd" (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 44:28; 45:1</reflink>). God employed him in doing service to his ancient people. He may posibly have gained, through contact with the Jews, some knowledge of their religion.</description>
    <description>The "first year of Cyrus" (<reflink target="XXX">Ezra 1:1</reflink>) is not the year of his elevation to power over the Medes, nor over the Persians, nor the year of the fall of Babylon, but the year succeeding the two years during which "Darius the Mede" was viceroy in Babylon after its fall. At this time only (B.C. 536) Cyrus became actual king over Palestine, which became a part of his Babylonian empire. The edict of Cyrus for the rebuilding of Jerusalem marked a great epoch in the history of the Jewish people (<reflink target="XXX">2 Chr. 36:22, 23; Ezra 1:1-4; 4:3; 5:13-17; 6:3-5</reflink>).</description>
    <description>This decree was discovered "at Achmetha [R.V. marg., "Ecbatana"], in the palace that is in the province of the Medes" (<reflink target="XXX">Ezra 6:2</reflink>). A chronicle drawn up just after the conquest of Babylonia by Cyrus, gives the history of the reign of Nabonidus (Nabunahid), the last king of Babylon, and of the fall of the Babylonian empire. In B.C. 538 there was a revolt in Southern Babylonia, while the army of Cyrus entered the country from the north. In June the Babylonian army was completely defeated at Opis, and immediately afterwards Sippara opened its gates to the conqueror. Gobryas (Ugbaru), the governor of Kurdistan, was then sent to Babylon, which surrendered "without fighting," and the daily services in the temples continued without a break. In October, Cyrus himself arrived, and proclaimed a general amnesty, which was communicated by Gobryas to "all the province of Babylon," of which he had been made governor. Meanwhile, Nabonidus, who had concealed himself, was captured, but treated honourably; and when his wife died, Cambyses, the son of Cyrus, conducted the funeral. Cyrus now assumed the title of "king of Babylon," claimed to be the descendant of the ancient kings, and made rich offerings to the temples. At the same time he allowed the foreign populations who had been deported to Babylonia to return to their old homes, carrying with them the images of their gods. Among these populations were the Jews, who, as they had no images, took with them the sacred vessels of the temple.</description>

  <item id="Daberath">
    <description>pasture, a Levitical town of Issachar (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 19:12; 21:28</reflink>), near the border of Zebulum. It is the modern small village of Deburich, at the base of Mount Tabor. Tradition has incorrectly made it the scene of the miracle of the cure of the lunatic child (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 17:14</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Daemon">
    <description>the Greek form, rendered "devil" in the Authorized Version of the New Testament. Daemons are spoken of as spiritual beings (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 8:16; 10:1; 12:43-45</reflink>) at enmity with God, and as having a certain power over man (<reflink target="XXX">James 2:19; Rev. 16:14</reflink>). They recognize our Lord as the Son of God (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 8:20; Luke 4:41</reflink>). They belong to the number of those angels that "kept not their first estate," "unclean spirits," "fallen angels," the angels of the devil (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 25:41; Rev. 12:7-9</reflink>). They are the "principalities and powers" against which we must "wrestle" (<reflink target="XXX">Eph. 6:12</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Daemoniac">
    <description>one "possessed with a devil." In the days of our Lord and his apostles, evil spirits, "daemons," were mysteriously permitted by God to exercise an influence both over the souls and bodies of men, inflicting dumbness (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 9:32</reflink>), blindness (12:22), epilepsy (<reflink target="XXX">Mark 9:17-27</reflink>), insanity (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 8:28; Mark 5:1-5</reflink>). Daemoniacs are frequently distinguished from those who are afflicted with ordinary bodily maladies (<reflink target="XXX">Mark 1:32; 16:17, 18; Luke 6:17, 18</reflink>). The daemons speak in their own persons (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 8:29; Mark 1:23, 24; 5:7</reflink>). This influence is clearly distinguished from the ordinary power of corruption and of temptation over men. In the daemoniac his personality seems to be destroyed, and his actions, words, and even thoughts to be overborne by the evil spirit (Mark, l.c.; Acts 19:15).</description>

  <item id="Dagon">
    <description>little fish; diminutive from dag = a fish, the fish-god; the national god of the Philistines (<reflink target="XXX">Judg. 16:23</reflink>). This idol had the body of a fish with the head and hands of a man. It was an Assyrio-Babylonian deity, the worship of which was introduced among the Philistines through Chaldea. The most famous of the temples of Dagon were at Gaza (<reflink target="XXX">Judg. 16:23-30</reflink>) and Ashdod (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 5:1-7</reflink>). (<see target="x-self">See FISH.</see>)</description>

    <description>(<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 5:2</reflink>), or Beth-dagon, as elsewhere rendered (<reflink target="XXX">Josh.15: 41; 19:27</reflink>), was the sanctuary or temple of Dagon.</description>
    <description>The Beth-dagon of Josh. 15:41 was one of the cities of the tribe of Judah, in the lowland or plain which stretches westward. It has not been identified.</description>
    <description>The Beth-dagon of Josh. 19:27 was one of the border cities of Asher.</description>
    <description>That of 1 Chr. 10:10 was in the western half-tribe of Manasseh, where the Philistines, after their victory at Gilboa, placed Saul's head in the temple of their god. (Comp. 1 Sam. 31:8-13).</description>

  <item id="Daily sacrifice">
    <description>(<reflink target="XXX">Dan. 8:12; 11:31; 12:11</reflink>), a burnt offering of two lambs of a year old, which were daily sacrificed in the name of the whole Israelitish people upon the great altar, the first at dawn of day, and the second at evening (<reflink target="XXX">Dan. 9:21</reflink>), or more correctly, "between the two evenings."

  <item id="Dale, the king's">
    <description>the name of a valley, the alternative for "the valley of Shaveh" (q.v.), near the Dead Sea, where the king of Sodom met Abraham (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 14:17</reflink>). Some have identified it with the southern part of the valley of Jehoshaphat, where Absalom reared his family monument (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 18:18</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Dalmanutha">
    <description>a place on the west of the Sea of Galilee, mentioned only in Mark 8:10. In the parallel passage it is said that Christ came "into the borders of Magdala" (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 15:39</reflink>). It is plain, then, that Dalmanutha was near Magdala, which was probably the Greek name of one of the many Migdols (i.e., watch-towers) on the western side of the lake of Gennesaret. It has been identified in the ruins of a village about a mile from Magdala, in the little open valley of 'Ain-el-Barideh, "the cold fountain," called el-Mejdel, possibly the "Migdal-el" of Josh. 19:38.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Dalmatia">
    <description>a mountainous country on the eastern shore of the Adriatic, a part of the Roman province of Illyricum. It still bears its ancient name. During Paul's second imprisonment at Rome, Titus left him to visit Dalmatia (<reflink target="XXX">2 Tim. 4:10</reflink>) for some unknown purpose. Paul had himself formerly preached in that region (<reflink target="XXX">Rom. 15:19</reflink>).</description>

  <item id="Damascus">
    <description>activity, the most ancient of Oriental cities; the capital of Syria (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 7:8; 17:3</reflink>); situated about 133 miles to the north of Jerusalem. Its modern name is Esh-Sham; i.e., "the East."</description>
    <description>The situation of this city is said to be the most beautiful of all Western Asia. It is mentioned among the conquests of the Egyptian king Thothmes III. (B.C. 1500), and in the Amarna tablets (B.C. 1400).</description>
    <description>It is first mentioned in Scripture in connection with Abraham's victory over the confederate kings under Chedorlaomer (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 14:15</reflink>). It was the native place of Abraham's steward (15:2). It is not again noticed till the time of David, when "the Syrians of Damascus came to succour Hadadezer" (q.v.), 2 Sam. 8:5; 1 Chr. 18:5. In the reign of Solomon, Rezon became leader of a band who revolted from Hadadezer (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 11:23</reflink>), and betaking themselves to Damascus, settled there and made their leader king. There was a long war, with varying success, between the Israelites and Syrians, who at a later period became allies of Israel against Judah (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 15:37</reflink>).</description>
    <description>The Syrians were at length subdued by the Assyrians, the city of Damascus was taken and destroyed, and the inhabitants carried captive into Assyria (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 16:7-9; comp. Isa. 7:8</reflink>). In this, prophecy was fulfilled (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 17:1; Amos 1:4; Jer. 49:24</reflink>). The kingdom of Syria remained a province of Assyria till the capture of Nineveh by the Medes (B.C. 625), when it fell under the conquerors. After passing through various vicissitudes, Syria was invaded by the Romans (B.C. 64), and Damascus became the seat of the government of the province. In A.D. 37 Aretas, the king of Arabia, became master of Damascus, having driven back Herod Antipas.</description>
    <description>This city is memorable as the scene of Saul's conversion (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 9:1-25</reflink>). The street called "Straight," in which Judas lived, in whose house Saul was found by Ananias, is known by the name Sultany, or "Queen's Street." It is the principal street of the city. Paul visited Damascus again on his return from Arabia (<reflink target="XXX">Gal. 1:16, 17</reflink>). Christianity was planted here as a centre (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 9:20</reflink>), from which it spread to the surrounding regions.</description>
    <description>In A.D. 634 Damascus was conquered by the growing Mohammedan power. In A.D. 1516 it fell under the dominion of the Turks, its present rulers. It is now the largest city in Asiatic Turkey. Christianity has again found a firm footing within its walls.</description>

  <item id="Damnation">
    <description>in Rom. 13:2, means "condemnation," which comes on those who withstand God's ordinance of magistracy. This sentence of condemnation comes not from the magistrate, but from God, whose authority is thus resisted.</description>
    <description>In 1 Cor. 11:29 (R.V., "judgment") this word means condemnation, in the sense of exposure to severe temporal judgements from God, as the following verse explains.</description>
    <description>In Rom. 14:23 the word "damned" means "condemned" by one's own conscience, as well as by the Word of God. The apostle shows here that many things which are lawful are not expedient; and that in using our Christian liberty the question should not simply be, Is this course I follow lawful? but also, Can I follow it without doing injury to the spiritual interests of a brother in Christ? He that "doubteth", i.e., is not clear in his conscience as to "meats", will violate his conscience "if he eat," and in eating is condemned; and thus one ought not so to use his liberty as to lead one who is "weak" to bring upon himself this condemnation.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Dan">
    <description>a judge. (1.) The fifth son of Jacob. His mother was Bilhah, Rachel's maid (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 30:6, "God hath judged me", Heb. dananni</reflink>). The blessing pronounced on him by his father was, "Dan shall judge his people" (49:16), probably in allusion to the judgeship of Samson, who was of the tribe of Dan.</description>
    <description>The tribe of Dan had their place in the march through the wilderness on the north side of the tabernacle (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 2:25, 31; 10:25</reflink>). It was the last of the tribes to receive a portion in the Land of Promise. Its position and extent are described in Josh. 19:40-48.</description>
    <description>The territory of Dan extended from the west of that of Ephraim and Benjamin to the sea. It was a small territory, but was very fertile. It included in it, among others, the cities of Lydda, Ekron, and Joppa, which formed its northern boundary. But this district was too limited. "Squeezed into the narrow strip between the mountains and the sea, its energies were great beyond its numbers." Being pressed by the Amorites and the Philistines, whom they were unable to conquer, they longed for a wider space. They accordingly sent out five spies from two of their towns, who went north to the sources of the Jordan, and brought back a favourable report regarding that region. "Arise," they said, "be not slothful to go, and to possess the land," for it is "a place where there is no want of any thing that is in the earth" (<reflink target="XXX">Judg. 18:10</reflink>). On receiving this report, 600 Danites girded on their weapons of war, and taking with them their wives and their children, marched to the foot of Hermon, and fought against Leshem, and took it from the Sidonians, and dwelt therein, and changed the name of the conquered town to Dan (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 19:47</reflink>). This new city of Dan became to them a new home, and was wont to be spoken of as the northern limit of Palestine, the length of which came to be denoted by the expression "from Dan to Beersheba", i.e., about 144 miles.</description>
    <description>"But like Lot under a similar temptation, they seem to have succumbed to the evil influences around them, and to have sunk down into a condition of semi-heathenism from which they never emerged. The mounds of ruins which mark the site of the city show that it covered a considerable extent of ground. But there remains no record of any noble deed wrought by the degenerate tribe. Their name disappears from the roll-book of the natural and the spiritual Israel.", Manning's Those Holy Fields.</description>
    <description>This old border city was originally called Laish. Its modern name is Tell el-Kady, "Hill of the Judge." It stands about four miles below Caesarea Philippi, in the midst of a region of surpassing richness and beauty.</description>
    <description>(2.) This name occurs in Ezek 27:19, Authorize Version; but the words there, "Dan also," should be simply, as in the Revised Version, "Vedan," an Arabian city, from which various kinds of merchandise were brought to Tyre. Some suppose it to have been the city of Aden in Arabia. (<see target="x-self">See MAHANEH-DAN.</see>)</description>

  <item id="Dan-jaan">
    <description>woodland Dan, a place probably somewhere in the direction of Dan, near the sources of the Jordan (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 24:6</reflink>). The LXX. and the Vulgate read "Dan-ja'ar", i.e., "Dan in the forest."</description>

  <item id="Dance">
    <description>found in Judg. 21:21, 23; Ps. 30:11; 149:3; 150:4; Jer. 31:4, 13, etc., as the translation of _hul_, which points to the whirling motion of Oriental sacred dances. It is the rendering of a word (rakad') which means to skip or leap for joy, in Eccl. 3:4; Job 21:11; Isa. 13:21, etc.</description>
    <description>In the New Testament it is in like manner the translation of different Greek words, circular motion (<reflink target="XXX">Luke 15:25</reflink>); leaping up and down in concert (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 11:17</reflink>), and by a single person (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 14:6</reflink>).</description>
    <description>It is spoken of as symbolical of rejoicing (<reflink target="XXX">Eccl. 3:4. Comp. Ps. 30:11; Matt. 11: 17</reflink>). The Hebrews had their sacred dances expressive of joy and thanksgiving, when the performers were usually females (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 15:20; 1 Sam. 18:6</reflink>).</description>
    <description>The ancient dance was very different from that common among Western nations. It was usually the part of the women only (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 15:20; Judg. 11:34; comp. 5:1</reflink>). Hence the peculiarity of David's conduct in dancing before the ark of the Lord (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 6:14</reflink>). The women took part in it with their timbrels. Michal should, in accordance with the example of Miriam and others, have herself led the female choir, instead of keeping aloof on the occasion and "looking through the window." David led the choir "uncovered", i.e., wearing only the ephod or linen tunic. He thought only of the honour of God, and forgot himself.</description>
    <description>From being reserved for occasions of religious worship and festivity, it came gradually to be practised in common life on occasions of rejoicing (<reflink target="XXX">Jer. 31:4</reflink>). The sexes among the Jews always danced separately. The daughter of Herodias danced alone (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 14:6</reflink>).</description>

  <item id="Daniel">
    <description>God is my judge, or judge of God. (1.) David's second son, "born unto him in Hebron, of Abigail the Carmelitess" (<reflink target="XXX">1 Chr. 3:1</reflink>). He is called also Chileab (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 3:3</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(2.) One of the four great prophets, although he is not once spoken of in the Old Testament as a prophet. His life and prophecies are recorded in the Book of Daniel. He was descended from one of the noble families of Judah (<reflink target="XXX">Dan. 1:3</reflink>), and was probably born in Jerusalem about B.C. 623, during the reign of Josiah. At the first deportation of the Jews by Nebuchadnezzar (the kingdom of Israel had come to an end nearly a century before), or immediately after his victory over the Egyptians at the second battle of Carchemish, in the fourth year of the reign of Jehoiakim (B.C. 606), Daniel and other three noble youths were carried off to Babylon, along with part of the vessels of the temple. There he was obliged to enter into the service of the king of Babylon, and in accordance with the custom of the age received the Chaldean name of Belteshazzar, i.e., "prince of Bel," or "Bel protect the king!" His residence in Babylon was very probably in the palace of Nebuchadnezzar, now identified with a mass of shapeless mounds called the Kasr, on the right bank of the river.</description>
    <description>His training in the schools of the wise men in Babylon (<reflink target="XXX">Dan. 1:4</reflink>) was to fit him for service to the empire. He was distinguished during this period for his piety and his stict observance of the Mosaic law (1:8-16), and gained the confidence and esteem of those who were over him. His habit of attention gained during his education in Jerusalem enabled him soon to master the wisdom and learning of the Chaldeans, and even to excel his compeers.</description>
    <description>At the close of his three years of discipline and training in the royal schools, Daniel was distinguished for his proficiency in the "wisdom" of his day, and was brought out into public life. He soon became known for his skill in the interpretation of dreams (1:17; 2:14), and rose to the rank of governor of the province of Babylon, and became "chief of the governors" (Chald. Rab-signin) over all the wise men of Babylon. He made known and also interpreted Nebuchadnezzar's dream; and many years afterwards, when he was now an old man, amid the alarm and consternation of the terrible night of Belshazzar's impious feast, he was called in at the instance of the queen-mother (perhaps Nitocris, the daughter of Nebuchadnezzar) to interpret the mysterious handwriting on the wall. He was rewarded with a purple robe and elevation to the rank of "third ruler." The place of "second ruler" was held by Belshazzar as associated with his father, Nabonidus, on the throne (5:16). Daniel interpreted the handwriting, and "in that night was Belshazzar the king of the Chaldeans slain."</description>
    <description>After the taking of Babylon, Cyrus, who was now master of all Asia from India to the Dardanelles, placed Darius (q.v.), a Median prince, on the throne, during the two years of whose reign Daniel held the office of first of the "three presidents" of the empire, and was thus practically at the head of affairs, no doubt interesting himself in the prospects of the captive Jews (Dan. 9), whom he had at last the happiness of seeing restored to their own land, although he did not return with them, but remained still in Babylon. His fidelity to God exposed him to persecution, and he was cast into a den of lions, but was miraculously delivered; after which Darius issued a decree enjoining reverence for "the God of Daniel" (6:26). He "prospered in the reign of Darius, and in the reign of Cyrus the Persian," whom he probably greatly influenced in the matter of the decree which put an end to the Captivity (B.C. 536).</description>
    <description>He had a series of prophetic visions vouch-safed to him which opened up the prospect of a glorious future for the people of God, and must have imparted peace and gladness to his spirit in his old age as he waited on at his post till the "end of the days." The time and circumstances of his death are not recorded. He probably died at Susa, about eighty-five years of age.</description>
    <description>Ezekiel, with whom he was contemporary, mentions him as a pattern of righteousness (14:14, 20) and wisdom (28:3). (<see target="x-self">See NEBUCHADNEZZAR.</see>)</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Daniel, Book of">
    <description>is ranked by the Jews in that division of their Bible called the Hagiographa (Heb. Khethubim). (<see target="x-self">See BIBLE.</see>) It consists of two distinct parts. The first part, consisting of the first six chapters, is chiefly historical; and the second part, consisting of the remaining six chapters, is chiefly prophetical.</description>
    <description>The historical part of the book treats of the period of the Captivity. Daniel is "the historian of the Captivity, the writer who alone furnishes any series of events for that dark and dismal period during which the harp of Israel hung on the trees that grew by the Euphrates. His narrative may be said in general to intervene between Kings and Chronicles on the one hand and Ezra on the other, or (more strictly) to fill out the sketch which the author of the Chronicles gives in a single verse in his last chapter: 'And them that had escaped from the sword carried he [i.e., Nebuchadnezzar] away to Babylon; where they were servants to him and his sons until the reign of the kingdom of Persia'" (<reflink target="XXX">2 Chr. 36:20</reflink>).</description>
    <description>The prophetical part consists of three visions and one lengthened prophetical communication.</description>
    <description>The genuineness of this book has been much disputed, but the arguments in its favour fully establish its claims. (1.) We have the testimony of Christ (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 24:15; 25:31; 26:64</reflink>) and his apostles (<reflink target="XXX">1 Cor. 6:2; 2 Thess. 2:3</reflink>) for its authority; and (2) the important testimony of Ezekiel (14:14, 20; 28:3). (3.) The character and records of the book are also entirely in harmony with the times and circumstances in which the author lived. (4.) The linguistic character of the book is, moreover, just such as might be expected. Certain portions (<reflink target="XXX">Dan. 2:4; 7</reflink>) are written in the Chaldee language; and the portions written in Hebrew are in a style and form having a close affinity with the later books of the Old Testament, especially with that of Ezra. The writer is familiar both with the Hebrew and the Chaldee, passing from the one to the other just as his subject required. This is in strict accordance with the position of the author and of the people for whom his book was written. That Daniel is the writer of this book is also testified to in the book itself (7:1, 28; 8:2; 9:2; 10:1, 2; 12:4, 5). (<see target="x-self">See BELSHAZZAR.</see>)</description>

It was a gold coin, bearing the figure of a Persian King with his crown and armed with bow and arrow. It was current among the Jews after their return from Babylon, i.e., while under the Persian domination. It weighed about 128 grains troy, and was of the value of about one guinea or rather more of our money. It is the first coin mentioned in Scripture, and is the oldest that history makes known to us.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Darius">
    <description>the holder or supporter, the name of several Persian kings. (1.) Darius the Mede (<reflink target="XXX">Dan. 11:1</reflink>), "the son of Ahasuerus, of the seed of the Medes" (9:1). On the death of Belshazzar the Chaldean he "received the kingdom" of Babylon as viceroy from Cyrus. During his brief reign (B.C. 538-536) Daniel was promoted to the highest dignity (<reflink target="XXX">Dan. 6:1, 2</reflink>); but on account of the malice of his enemies he was cast into the den of lions. After his miraculous escape, a decree was issued by Darius enjoining "reverence for the God of Daniel" (6:26). This king was probably the "Astyages" of the Greek historians. Nothing can, however, be with certainty affirmed regarding him. Some are of opinion that the name "Darius" is simply a name of office, equivalent to "governor," and that the "Gobryas" of the inscriptions was the person intended by the name.</description>
    <description>(2.) Darius, king of Persia, was the son of Hystaspes, of the royal family of the Achaemenidae. He did not immediately succeed Cyrus on the throne. There were two intermediate kings, viz., Cambyses (the Ahasuerus of Ezra), the son of Cyrus, who reigned from B.C. 529-522, and was succeeded by a usurper named Smerdis, who occupied the throne only ten months, and was succeeded by this Darius (B.C. 521-486). Smerdis was a Margian, and therefore had no sympathy with Cyrus and Cambyses in the manner in which they had treated the Jews. He issued a decree prohibiting the restoration of the temple and of Jerusalem (<reflink target="XXX">Ezra 4:17-22</reflink>). But soon after his death and the accession of Darius, the Jews resumed their work, thinking that the edict of Smerdis would be now null and void, as Darius was in known harmony with the religious policy of Cyrus. The enemies of the Jews lost no time in bringing the matter under the notice of Darius, who caused search to be made for the decree of Cyrus (q.v.). It was not found at Babylon, but at Achmetha (<reflink target="XXX">Ezra 6:2</reflink>); and Darius forthwith issued a new decree, giving the Jews full liberty to prosecute their work, at the same time requiring the Syrian satrap and his subordinates to give them all needed help. It was with the army of this king that the Greeks fought the famous battle of Marathon (B.C. 490). During his reign the Jews enjoyed much peace and prosperity. He was succeeded by Ahasuerus, known to the Greeks as Xerxes, who reigned for twenty-one years.</description>
    <description>(3.) Darius the Persian (<reflink target="XXX">Neh. 12:22</reflink>) was probably the Darius II. (Ochus or Nothus) of profane history, the son of Artaxerxes Longimanus, who was the son and successor of Ahasuerus (Xerxes). There are some, however, who think that the king here meant was Darius III. (Codomannus), the antagonist of Alexander the Great (B.C. 336-331).</description>

  <item id="Darkness">
    <description>The plague (the ninth) of darkness in Egypt (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 10:21</reflink>) is described as darkness "which may be felt." It covered "all the land of Egypt," so that "they saw not one another." It did not extend to the land of Goshen (ver. 23).</description>
    <description>When Jesus hung upon the cross (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 27:45; Luke 23:44</reflink>), from the "sixth hour there was darkness over all the land unto the ninth hour."</description>
    <description>On Mount Sinai, Moses (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 20:21</reflink>) "drew near unto the thick darkness where God was." This was the "thick cloud upon the mount" in which Jehovah was when he spake unto Moses there. The Lord dwelt in the cloud upon the mercy-seat (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 8:12</reflink>), the cloud of glory. When the psalmist (<reflink target="XXX">Ps. 97:2</reflink>) describes the inscrutable nature of God's workings among the sons of men, he says, "Clouds and darkness are round about him." God dwells in thick darkness.</description>
    <description>Darkness (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 13:9, 10; Matt. 24:29</reflink>) also is a symbol of the judgments that attend on the coming of the Lord. It is a symbol of misery and adversity (<reflink target="XXX">Job 18:6; Ps. 107:10; Isa. 8:22; Ezek. 30:18</reflink>). The "day of darkness" in Joel 2:2, caused by clouds of locusts, is a symbol of the obscurity which overhangs all divine proceedings. "Works of darkness" are impure actions (<reflink target="XXX">Eph. 5:11</reflink>). "Outer darkness" refers to the darkness of the streets in the East, which are never lighted up by any public or private lamps after nightfall, in contrast with the blaze of cheerful light in the house. It is also a symbol of ignorance (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 9:2; 60:2; Matt. 6:23</reflink>) and of death (<reflink target="XXX">Job 10:21; 17:13</reflink>).</description>

Women as natives of a place, or as professing the religion of a place; as, "the daughters of Zion" (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 3:16</reflink>), "daughters of the Philistines" (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 1:20</reflink>). (3.) Small towns and villages lying around a city are its "daughters," as related to the metropolis or mother city. Tyre is in this sense called the daughter of Sidon (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 23:12</reflink>). (4.)

  <item id="David">
    <description>beloved, the eighth and youngest son of Jesse, a citizen of Bethlehem. His father seems to have been a man in humble life. His mother's name is not recorded. Some think she was the Nahash of 2 Sam. 17:25. As to his personal appearance, we only know that he was red-haired, with beautiful eyes and a fair face (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 16:12; 17:42</reflink>).</description>
    <description>His early occupation was that of tending his father's sheep on the uplands of Judah. From what we know of his after history, doubtless he frequently beguiled his time, when thus engaged, with his shepherd's flute, while he drank in the many lessons taught him by the varied scenes spread around him. His first recorded exploits were his encounters with the wild beasts of the field. He mentions that with his own unaided hand he slew a lion and also a bear, when they came out against his flock, beating them to death in open conflict with his club (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 17:34, 35</reflink>).</description>
    <description>While David, in the freshness of ruddy youth, was thus engaged with his flocks, Samuel paid an unexpected visit to Bethlehem, having been guided thither by divine direction (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 16:1-13</reflink>). There he offered up sacrifice, and called the elders of Israel and Jesse's family to the sacrificial meal. Among all who appeared before him he failed to discover the one he sought. David was sent for, and the prophet immediately recognized him as the chosen of God, chosen to succeed Saul, who was now departing from the ways of God, on the throne of the kingdom. He accordingly, in anticipation, poured on his head the anointing oil. David went back again to his shepherd life, but "the Spirit of the Lord came upon David from that day forward," and "the Spirit of the Lord departed from Saul" (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 16:13, 14</reflink>).</description>
    <description>Not long after this David was sent for to soothe with his harp the troubled spirit of Saul, who suffered from a strange melancholy dejection. He played before the king so skilfully that Saul was greatly cheered, and began to entertain great affection for the young shepherd. After this he went home to Bethlehem. But he soon again came into prominence. The armies of the Philistines and of Israel were in battle array in the valley of Elah, some 16 miles south-west of Bethlehem; and David was sent by his father with provisions for his three brothers, who were then fighting on the side of the king. On his arrival in the camp of Israel, David (now about twenty years of age) was made aware of the state of matters when the champion of the Philistines, Goliath of Gath, came forth to defy Israel. David took his sling, and with a well-trained aim threw a stone "out of the brook," which struck the giant's forehead, so that he fell senseless to the ground. David then ran and slew him, and cut off his head with his own sword (1 Sam. 17). The result was a great victory to the Israelites, who pursued the Philistines to the gates of Gath and Ekron.</description>
    <description>David's popularity consequent on this heroic exploit awakened Saul's jealousy (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 18:6-16</reflink>), which he showed in various ways. He conceived a bitter hatred toward him, and by various stratagems sought his death (1 Sam. 18-30). The deep-laid plots of the enraged king, who could not fail to observe that David "prospered exceedingly," all proved futile, and only endeared the young hero the more to the people, and very specially to Jonathan, Saul's son, between whom and David a life-long warm friendship was formed.</description>
    <description>A fugitive. To escape from the vengeance of Saul, David fled to Ramah (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 19:12-18</reflink>) to Samuel, who received him, and he dwelt among the sons of the prophets, who were there under Samuel's training. It is supposed by some that the sixth, seventh, and eleventh Psalms were composed by him at this time. This place was only 3 miles from the residence of Saul, who soon discovered whither the fugitive had gone, and tried ineffectually to bring him back. Jonathan made a fruitless effort to bring his father to a better state of mind toward David (1 Sam. 20), who, being made aware of the fact, saw no hope of safety but in flight to a distance. We accordingly find him first at Nob (21:1-9) and then at Gath, the chief city of the Philistines. The king of the Philistines would not admit him into his service, as he expected that he would, and David accordingly now betook himself to the stronghold of Adullam (22:1-4; 1 Chr. 12:8-18). Here in a short time 400 men gathered around him and acknowledged him as their leader. It was at this time that David, amid the harassment and perils of his position, cried, "Oh that one would give me drink of the water of the well of Bethlehem;" when three of his heroes broke through the lines of the Philistines and brought him the water for which he longed (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 23:13-17</reflink>), but which he would not drink.</description>
    <description>In his rage at the failure of all his efforts to seize David, Saul gave orders for the massacre of the entire priestly family at Nob, "persons who wore a linen ephod", to the number of eighty-five persons, who were put to death by Doeg the Edomite. The sad tidings of the massacre were brought to David by Abiathar, a son of Ahimelech, the only one who escaped. Comp. Ps. 52.</description>
    <description>Hearing that Keilah, a town on the western frontier, was harassed by the Philistines, David with his men relieved it (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 23:1-14</reflink>); and then, for fear of Saul, he fled to the strongholds in the "hill country" of Judah. Comp. Ps. 31. While encamped there, in the forest in the district of Ziph, he was visited by Jonathan, who spoke to him words of encouragement (23:16-18). The two now parted never to meet again. Saul continued his pursuit of David, who narrowly escaped from him at this time, and fled to the crags and ravines of Engedi, on the western shore of the Dead Sea (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 23:29</reflink>). Here Saul, who still pursued him with his army, narrowly escaped, through the generous forbearance of David, and was greatly affected by what David had done for him. He returned home from pursuing him, and David betook himself to Maon, where, with his 600 men, he maintained himself by contributions gathered from the district. Here occurred the incident connected with Nabal and his wife Abigail (1 Sam. 25), whom David married after Nabal's death.</description>
    <description>Saul again went forth (1 Sam. 26) in pursuit of David, who had hid himself "in the hill Hachilah, which is before Jeshimon," in the wilderness of Ziph, and was a second time spared through his forbearance. He returned home, professing shame and penitence for the way in which he had treated David, and predicting his elevation to the throne.</description>
    <description>Fighting against Israel. Harassed by the necessity of moving from place to place through fear of Saul, David once more sought refuge among the Philistines (1 Sam. 27). He was welcomed by the king, who assigned him Ziklag as his residence. Here David lived among his followers for some time as an independent chief engaged in frequent war with the Amalekites and other tribes on the south of Judah.</description>
    <description>Achish summoned David with his men to join his army against Saul; but the lords of the Philistines were suspicious of David's loyalty, and therefore he was sent back to Ziklag, which he found to his dismay may had been pillaged and burnt during his brief absence. David pursued after the raiders, the Amalekites, and completely routed them. On his return to Ziklag tidings reached him of Saul's death (2 Sam. 1). An Amalekite brought Saul's crown and bracelet and laid them at his feet. David and his men rent their clothes and mourned for Saul, who had been defeated in battle near Mount Gilboa. David composed a beautiful elegy, the most beautiful of all extant Hebrew odes, a "lamentation over Saul and over Jonathan his son" (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 1:18-27</reflink>). It bore the title of "The Bow," and was to be taught to the children, that the memory of Saul and Jonathan might be preserved among them. "Behold, it is written in the book of Jasher" (q.v.).</description>
    <description>David king over Judah. David and his men now set out for Hebron under divine direction (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 2:1-4</reflink>). There they were cordially welcomed, and he was at once anointed as king. He was now about thirty years of age.</description>
    <description>But his title to the throne was not undisputed. Abner took Ish-bosheth, Saul's only remaining son, over the Jordan to Mahanaim, and there crowned him as king. Then began a civil war in Israel. The first encounter between the two opposing armies, led on the one side by Abner, and on the other by Joab, took place at the pool of Gibeon. It resulted in the defeat of Abner. Other encounters, however, between Israel and Judah followed (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 3:1, 5</reflink>), but still success was on the side of David. For the space of seven and a half years David reigned in Hebron. Abner now sided with David, and sought to promote his advancement; but was treacherously put to death by Joab in revenge for his having slain his brother Asahel at Gibeon (3:22-39). This was greatly to David's regret. He mourned for the death of Abner. Shortly after this Ish-bosheth was also treacherously put to death by two Canaanites of Beeroth; and there being now no rival, David was anointed king over all Israel (4:1-12).</description>
    <description>David king over all Israel (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 5:1-5; 1 Chr. 11:1-3</reflink>). The elders of Israel now repaired to Hebron and offered allegiance to David in name of all the people, among whom the greatest enthusiasm prevailed. He was anointed king over all Israel, and sought out a new seat of government, more suitable than Hebron, as the capital of his empire. At this time there was a Jebusite fortress, "the stronghold", on the hill of Zion, called also Jebus. This David took from the Jebusites, and made it Israel's capital, and established here his residence, and afterwards built for himself a palace by the aid of Tyrian tradesmen. The Philistines, who had for some time observed a kind of truce, now made war against David; but were defeated in battle at a place afterwards called, in remembrance of the victory, Baal-perazim. Again they invaded the land, and were a second time routed by him. He thus delivered Israel from their enemies.</description>
    <description>David now resolved to bring up the ark of the covenant to his new capital (2 Sam. 6). It was in the house of Abinadab at Kirjath-jearim, about 7 miles from Jerusalem, where it had been for many years, from the time when the Philistines had sent it home (1 Sam. 6; 7). In consequence of the death of Uzzah (for it was a divine ordinance that only the Levites should handle the ark, Num. 4), who had put forth his hand to steady the ark when the cart in which it was being conveyed shook by reason of the roughness of the road, David stayed the procession, and conveyed the ark into the house of Obed-edom, a Philistine from Gath. After three months David brought the ark from the house of Obed-edom up to Jerusalem. Comp. Ps. 24. Here it was placed in a new tent or tabernacle which David erected for the purpose. About seventy years had passed since it had stood in the tabernacle at Shiloh. The old tabernacle was now at Gibeah, at which Zadok ministered. David now (1 Chr. 16) carefully set in order all the ritual of divine worship at Jerusalem, along with Abiathar the high priest. A new religious era began. The service of praise was for the first time introduced into public worship. Zion became henceforth "God's holy hill."</description>
    <description>David's wars. David now entered on a series of conquests which greatly extended and strengthened his kingdom (2 Sam. 8). In a few years the whole territory from the Euphrates to the river of Egypt, and from Gaza on the west to Thapsacus on the east, was under his sway (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 8:3-13; 10</reflink>).</description>
    <description>David's fall. He had now reached the height of his glory. He ruled over a vast empire, and his capital was enriched with the spoils of many lands. But in the midst of all this success he fell, and his character became stained with the sin of adultery (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 11:2-27</reflink>). It has been noted as characteristic of the Bible that while his military triumphs are recorded in a few verses, the sad story of his fall is given in detail, a story full of warning, and therefore recorded. This crime, in the attempt to conceal it, led to anoter. He was guilty of murder. Uriah, whom he had foully wronged, an officer of the Gibborim, the corps of heros (23:39), was, by his order, "set in the front of the hottest battle" at the siege of Rabbah, in order that he might be put to death. Nathan the prophet (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 7:1-17; 12:1-23</reflink>) was sent by God to bring home his crimes to the conscience of the guilty monarch. He became a true penitent. He bitterly bewailed his sins before God. The thirty-second and fifty-first Psalms reveal the deep struggles of his soul, and his spiritual recovery.</description>
    <description>Bathsheba became his wife after Uriah's death. Her first-born son died, according to the word of the prophet. She gave birth to a second son, whom David called Solomon, and who ultimately succeeded him on the throne (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 12:24, 25</reflink>).</description>
    <description>Peace. After the successful termination of all his wars, David formed the idea of building a temple for the ark of God. This he was not permitted to carry into execution, because he had been a man of war. God, however, sent Nathan to him with a gracious message (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 7:1-16</reflink>). On receiving it he went into the sanctuary, the tent where the ark was, and sat before the Lord, and poured out his heart in words of devout thanksgiving (18-29). The building of the temple was reserved for his son Solomon, who would be a man of peace (<reflink target="XXX">1 Chr. 22:9; 28:3</reflink>).</description>
    <description>A cloudy evening. Hitherto David's carrer had been one of great prosperity and success. Now cloudy and dark days came. His eldest son Amnon, whose mother was Ahinoam of Jezreel, was guilty of a great and shameful crime (2 Sam. 13). This was the beginning of the disasters of his later years. After two years Absalom terribly avenged the crime against Tamar, and put Amnon to death. This brought sore trouble to David's heart. Absalom, afraid of the consequences of his guilt, fled to Geshur beyond Jordan, where he remained for three years, when he was brought back through the intrigue of Joab (2 Sam. 14).</description>
    <description>After this there fell upon the land the calamity of three years' famine (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 21:1-14</reflink>). This was soon after followed by a pestilence, brought upon the land as a punishment for David's sinful pride in numbering the people (2 Sam. 24), in which no fewer than 70,000 perished in the space of three days.</description>
    <description>Rebellion of Absalom. The personal respect for David was sadly lowered by the incident of Bathsheba. There was a strong popular sentiment against the taking of the census, and the outburst of the plague in connection with it deepened the feeling of jealously that had begun to manifest itself among some of the tribes against David. Absalom, taking full advantage of this state of things, gradually gained over the people, and at length openly rebelled against his father, and usurped the throne. Ahithophel was Absalom's chief counsellor. The revolt began in Hebron, the capital of Judah. Absalom was there proclaimed king. David was now in imminent danger, and he left Jerusalem (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 15:13-20</reflink>), and once more became a fugitive. It was a momentous day in Israel. The incidents of it are recorded with a fulness of detail greater than of any other day in Old Testament history. David fled with his followers to Mahanarm, on the east of Jordan. An unnatural civil war broke out. After a few weeks the rival armies were mustered and organized. They met in hostile array at the wood of Ephraim (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 18:1-8</reflink>). Absalom's army was defeated, and himself put to death by the hand of Joab (9-18). The tidings of the death of his rebellious son filled the heart of David with the most poignant grief. He "went up to the chamber over the gate, and wept" (33), giving utterance to the heart-broken cry, "Would God I had died for thee, O Absalom, my son, my son!" Peace was now restored, and David returned to Jerusalem and resumed the direction of affairs. An unhappy dispute arose between the men of Judah and the men of Israel (19:41-43). Sheba, a Benjamite, headed a revolt of the men of Israel. He was pursued to Abelbeth-maachah, and was there put to death, and so the revolt came to an end.</description>
    <description>The end. After the suppression of the rebellion of Absalom and that of Sheba, ten comparatively peaceful years of David's life passed away. During those years he seems to have been principally engaged in accumulating treasures of every kind for the great temple at Jerusalem, which it was reserved to his successor to build (1 Chr. 22; 28; 29), a house which was to be "exceeding magnifical, of fame and of glory throughout all countries" (22:5). The exciting and laborious life he had spent, and the dangers and trials through which he had passed, had left him an enfeebled man, prematurely old. It became apparent that his life was now drawing to its close. A new palace conspiracy broke out as to who should be his successor. Joab favoured Adonijah. The chiefs of his party met at the "Fuller's spring," in the valley of Kidron, to proclaim him king; but Nathan hastened on a decision on the part of David in favour of Solomon, and so the aim of Adonijah's party failed. Solomon was brought to Jerusalem, and was anointed king and seated on his father's throne (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 1:11-53</reflink>). David's last words are a grand utterance, revealing his unfailing faith in God, and his joyful confidence in his gracious covenant promises (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 23:1-7</reflink>).</description>
    <description>After a reign of forty years and six months (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 5:5; 1 Chr. 3:4</reflink>) David died (B.C. 1015) at the age of seventy years, "and was buried in the city of David." His tomb is still pointed out on Mount Zion.</description>
    <description>Both in his prophetical and in his regal character David was a type of the Messiah (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 16:13</reflink>). The book of Psalms commonly bears the title of the "Psalms of David," from the circumstance that he was the largest contributor (about eighty psalms) to the collection. (<see target="x-self">See PSALMS.</see>)</description>
    <description>"The greatness of David was felt when he was gone. He had lived in harmony with both the priesthood and the prophets; a sure sign that the spirit of his government had been throughly loyal to the higher aims of the theocracy. The nation had not been oppressed by him, but had been left in the free enjoyment of its ancient liberties. As far as his power went he had striven to act justly to all (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 8:15</reflink>). His weak indulgence to his sons, and his own great sin besides, had been bitterly atoned, and were forgotten at his death in the remembrance of his long-tried worth. He had reigned thirty-three years in Jerusalem and seven and a half at Hebron (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 5:5</reflink>). Israel at his accession had reached the lowest point of national depression; its new-born unity rudely dissolved; its territory assailed by the Philistines. But he had left it an imperial power, with dominions like those of Egypt or Assyria. The sceptre of Solomon was already, before his father's death, owned from the Mediterranean to the Euphrates, and from the Orontes to the Red Sea.", Geikie's Hours etc., iii.</description>

  <item id="David, City of">
    <description>(1.) David took from the Jebusites the fortress of Mount Zion. He "dwelt in the fort, and called it the city of David" (<reflink target="XXX">1 Chr. 11:7</reflink>). This was the name afterwards given to the castle and royal palace on Mount Zion, as distinguished from Jerusalem generally (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 3:1; 8:1</reflink>), It was on the south-west side of Jerusalem, opposite the temple mount, with which it was connected by a bridge over the Tyropoeon valley.</description>
    <description>(2) Bethlehem is called the "city of David" (<reflink target="XXX">Luke 2:4, 11</reflink>), because it was David's birth-place and early home (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 17:12</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Day">
    <description>The Jews reckoned the day from sunset to sunset (<reflink target="XXX">Lev. 23:32</reflink>). It was originally divided into three parts (<reflink target="XXX">Ps. 55:17</reflink>). "The heat of the day" (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 11:11; Neh. 7:3</reflink>) was at our nine o'clock, and "the cool of the day" just before sunset (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 3:8</reflink>). Before the Captivity the Jews divided the night into three watches, (1) from sunset to midnight (<reflink target="XXX">Lam. 2:19</reflink>); (2) from midnight till the cock-crowing (<reflink target="XXX">Judg. 7:19</reflink>); and (3) from the cock-crowing till sunrise (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 14:24</reflink>). In the New Testament the division of the Greeks and Romans into four watches was adopted (<reflink target="XXX">Mark 13:35</reflink>). (<see target="x-self">See WATCHES.</see>)</description>
    <description>The division of the day by hours is first mentioned in Dan. 3:6, 15; 4:19; 5:5. This mode of reckoning was borrowed from the Chaldeans. The reckoning of twelve hours was from sunrise to sunset, and accordingly the hours were of variable length (<reflink target="XXX">John 11:9</reflink>).</description>
    <description>The word "day" sometimes signifies an indefinite time (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 2:4; Isa. 22:5; Heb. 3:8, etc.</reflink>). In Job 3:1 it denotes a birthday, and in Isa. 2:12, Acts 17:31, and 2 Tim. 1:18, the great day of final judgment.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Day's journey">
    <description>The usual length of a day's journey in the East, on camel or horseback, in six or eight hours, is about 25 or 30 miles. The "three days' journey" mentioned in Ex. 3:18 is simply a journey which would occupy three days in going and returning.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Daysman">
    <description>an umpire or arbiter or judge (<reflink target="XXX">Job 9:33</reflink>). This word is formed from the Latin diem dicere, i.e., to fix a day for hearing a cause. Such an one is empowered by mutual consent to decide the cause, and to "lay his hand", i.e., to impose his authority, on both, and enforce his sentence.</description>

  </item>
  <item id="Deacon">
    <description>Anglicized form of the Greek word diaconos, meaning a "runner," "messenger," "servant." For a long period a feeling of mutual jealousy had existed between the "Hebrews," or Jews proper, who spoke the sacred language of palestine, and the "Hellenists," or Jews of the Grecian speech, who had adopted the Grecian language, and read the Septuagint version of the Bible instead of the Hebrew. This jealousy early appeared in the Christian community. It was alleged by the Hellenists that their widows were overlooked in the daily distribution of alms. This spirit must be checked. The apostles accordingly advised the disciples to look out for seven men of good report, full of the Holy Ghost, and men of practical wisdom, who should take entire charge of this distribution, leaving them free to devote themselves entirely to the spiritual functions of their office (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 6:1-6</reflink>). This was accordingly done. Seven men were chosen, who appear from their names to have been Hellenists. The name "deacon" is nowhere applied to them in the New Testament; they are simply called "the seven" (21:8). Their office was at first secular, but it afterwards became also spiritual; for among other qualifications they must also be "apt to teach" (<reflink target="XXX">1 Tim. 3: 8-12</reflink>). Both Philip and Stephen, who were of "the seven," preached; they did "the work of evangelists."</description>

  </item>
  <item id="Dead Sea">
    <description>the name given by Greek writers of the second century to that inland sea called in Scripture the "salt sea" (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 14:3; Num. 34:12</reflink>), the "sea of the plain" (<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 3:17</reflink>), the "east sea" (<reflink target="XXX">Ezek. 47:18; Joel 2:20</reflink>), and simply "the sea" (<reflink target="XXX">Ezek. 47:8</reflink>). The Arabs call it Bahr Lut, i.e., the Sea of Lot. It lies about 16 miles in a straight line to the east of Jerusalem. Its surface is 1,292 feet below the surface of the Mediterranean Sea. It covers an area of about 300 square miles. Its depth varies from 1,310 to 11 feet. From various phenomena that have been observed, its bottom appears to be still subsiding. It is about 53 miles long, and of an average breadth of 10 miles. It has no outlet, the great heat of that region causing such rapid evaporation that its average depth, notwithstanding the rivers that run into it (<see target="x-self">see JORDAN</see>), is maintained with little variation. The Jordan alone discharges into it no less than six million tons of water every twenty-four hours.</description>
    <description>The waters of the Dead Sea contain 24.6 per cent. of mineral salts, about seven times as much as in ordinary sea-water; thus they are unusually buoyant. Chloride of magnesium is most abundant; next to that chloride of sodium (common salt). But terraces of alluvial deposits in the deep valley of the Jordan show that formerly one great lake extended from the Waters of Merom to the foot of the watershed in the Arabah. The waters were then about 1,400 feet above the present level of the Dead Sea, or slightly above that of the Mediterranean, and at that time were much less salt.</description>
    <description>Nothing living can exist in this sea. "The fish carried down by the Jordan at once die, nor can even mussels or corals live in it; but it is a fable that no bird can fly over it, or that there are no living creatures on its banks. Dr. Tristram found on the shores three kinds of kingfishers, gulls, ducks, and grebes, which he says live on the fish which enter the sea in shoals, and presently die. He collected one hundred and eighteen species of birds, some new to science, on the shores, or swimming or flying over the waters. The cane-brakes which fringe it at some parts are the homes of about forty species of mammalia, several of them animals unknown in England; and innumerable tropical or semi-tropical plants perfume the atmosphere wherever fresh water can reach. The climate is perfect and most delicious, and indeed there is perhaps no place in the world where a sanatorium could be established with so much prospect of benefit as at Ain Jidi (Engedi).", Geikie's Hours, etc.</description>

  <item id="Death">
    <description>may be simply defined as the termination of life. It is represented under a variety of aspects in Scripture: (1.) "The dust shall return to the earth as it was" (<reflink target="XXX">Eccl. 12:7</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(2.) "Thou takest away their breath, they die" (<reflink target="XXX">Ps. 104:29</reflink>).</description>

    <description>The grave is represented as "the gates of death" (<reflink target="XXX">Job 38:17; Ps. 9:13; 107:18</reflink>). The gloomy silence of the grave is spoken of under the figure of the "shadow of death" (<reflink target="XXX">Jer. 2:6</reflink>).</description>
    <description>Death is the effect of sin (<reflink target="XXX">Heb. 2:14</reflink>), and not a "debt of nature." It is but once (9:27), universal (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 3:19</reflink>), necessary (<reflink target="XXX">Luke 2:28-30</reflink>). Jesus has by his own death taken away its sting for all his followers (<reflink target="XXX">1 Cor. 15:55-57</reflink>).</description>
    <description>There is a spiritual death in trespasses and sins, i.e., the death of the soul under the power of sin (<reflink target="XXX">Rom. 8:6; Eph. 2:1, 3; Col. 2:13</reflink>).</description>
    <description>The "second death" (<reflink target="XXX">Rev. 2:11</reflink>) is the everlasting perdition of the wicked (<reflink target="XXX">Rev. 21:8</reflink>), and "second" in respect to natural or temporal death.</description>

    <description>oracle town; sanctuary. (1.) One of the eleven cities to the west of Hebron, in the highlands of Judah (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 15:49; Judg. 1:11-15</reflink>). It was originally one of the towns of the Anakim (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 15:15</reflink>), and was also called Kirjath-sepher (q.v.) and Kirjath-sannah (49). Caleb, who had conquered and taken possession of the town and district of Hebron (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 14:6-15</reflink>), offered the hand of his daughter to any one who would successfully lead a party against Debir. Othniel, his younger brother (<reflink target="XXX">Judg. 1:13; 3:9</reflink>), achieved the conquest, and gained Achsah as his wife. She was not satisfied with the portion her father gave her, and as she was proceeding toward her new home, she "lighted from off her ass" and said to him, "Give me a blessing [i.e., a dowry]: for thou hast given me a south land" (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 15:19, A.V.</reflink>); or, as in the Revised Version, "Thou hast set me in the land of the south", i.e., in the Negeb, outside the rich valley of Hebron, in the dry and barren land.

Here they were kept confined till Joshua returned from the pursuit of their discomfited armies, when he caused them to be brought forth, and "Joshua smote them, and slew them, and hanged them on five trees" (26).</description>

  <item id="Deborah">
    <description>a bee. (1.) Rebekah's nurse. She accompanied her mistress when she left her father's house in Padan-aram to become the wife of Isaac (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 24:59</reflink>). Many years afterwards she died at Bethel, and was buried under the "oak of weeping", Allon-bachuth (35:8).</description>
    <description>(2.) A prophetess, "wife" (woman?) of Lapidoth. Jabin, the king of Hazor, had for twenty years held Israel in degrading subjection. The spirit of patriotism seemed crushed out of the nation. In this emergency Deborah roused the people from their lethargy. Her fame spread far and wide. She became a "mother in Israel" (<reflink target="XXX">Judg. 4:6, 14; 5:7</reflink>), and "the children of Israel came up to her for judgment" as she sat in her tent under the palm tree "between Ramah and Bethel." Preparations were everywhere made by her direction for the great effort to throw off the yoke of bondage. She summoned Barak from Kadesh to take the command of 10,000 men of Zebulun and Naphtali, and lead them to Mount Tabor on the plain of Esdraelon at its north-east end. With his aid she organized this army. She gave the signal for attack, and the Hebrew host rushed down impetuously upon the army of Jabin, which was commanded by Sisera, and gained a great and decisive victory. The Canaanitish army almost wholly perished. That was a great and ever-memorable day in Israel. In Judg. 5 is given the grand triumphal ode, the "song of Deborah," which she wrote in grateful commemoration of that great deliverance.

  <item id="Debt">
    <description>The Mosaic law encouraged the practice of lending (<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 15:7; Ps. 37:26; Matt. 5:42</reflink>); but it forbade the exaction of interest except from foreigners. Usury was strongly condemned (<reflink target="XXX">Prov. 28:8; Ezek. 18:8, 13, 17; 22:12; Ps. 15:5</reflink>). On the Sabbatical year all pecuniary obligations were cancelled (<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 15:1-11</reflink>). These regulations prevented the accumulation of debt.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Debtor">
    <description>Various regulations as to the relation between debtor and creditor are laid down in the Scriptures.</description>
    <description>(1.) The debtor was to deliver up as a pledge to the creditor what he could most easily dispense with (<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 24:10, 11</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(2.) A mill, or millstone, or upper garment, when given as a pledge, could not be kept over night (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 22:26, 27</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(3.) A debt could not be exacted during the Sabbatic year (<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 15:1-15</reflink>).</description>
    <description>For other laws bearing on this relation see Lev. 25:14, 32, 39; Matt. 18:25, 34.</description>
    <description>(4.) A surety was liable in the same way as the original debtor (<reflink target="XXX">Prov. 11:15; 17:18</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Decalogue">
    <description>the name given by the Greek fathers to the ten commandments; "the ten words," as the original is more literally rendered (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 20:3-17</reflink>). These commandments were at first written on two stone slabs (31:18), which were broken by Moses throwing them down on the ground (32:19). They were written by God a second time (34:1). The decalogue is alluded to in the New Testament five times (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 5:17, 18, 19; Mark 10:19; Luke 18:20; Rom. 7:7, 8; 13:9; 1 Tim. 1:9, 10</reflink>).</description>
    <description>These commandments have been divided since the days of Origen the Greek father, as they stand in the Confession of all the Reformed Churches except the Lutheran. The division adopted by Luther, and which has ever since been received in the Lutheran Church, makes the first two commandments one, and the third the second, and so on to the last, which is divided into two. "Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's house" being ranked as ninth, and "Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's wife," etc., the tenth. (<see target="x-self">See COMMANDMENTS.</see>)</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Decapoils">
    <description>ten cities=deka, ten, and polis, a city, a district on the east and south-east of the Sea of Galilee containing "ten cities," which were chiefly inhabited by Greeks. It included a portion of Bashan and Gilead, and is mentioned three times in the New Testament (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 4:25; Mark 5:20; 7:31</reflink>). These cities were Scythopolis, i.e., "city of the Scythians", (ancient Bethshean, the only one of the ten cities on the west of Jordan), Hippos, Gadara, Pella (to which the Christians fled just before the destruction of Jerusalem), Philadelphia (ancient Rabbath-ammon), Gerasa, Dion, Canatha, Raphana, and Damascus. When the Romans conquered Syria (B.C. 65) they rebuilt, and endowed with certain privileges, these "ten cities," and the province connected with them they called "Decapolis."</description>

  <item id="Decision, Valley of">
    <description>a name given to the valley of Jehoshaphat (q.v.) as the vale of the sentence. The scene of Jehovah's signal inflictions on Zion's enemies (<reflink target="XXX">Joel 3:14; marg., "valley of concision or threshing"</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Decrees of God">
    <description>"The decrees of God are his eternal, unchangeable, holy, wise, and sovereign purpose, comprehending at once all things that ever were or will be in their causes, conditions, successions, and relations, and determining their certain futurition. The several contents of this one eternal purpose are, because of the limitation of our faculties, necessarily conceived of by us in partial aspects, and in logical relations, and are therefore styled Decrees." The decree being the act of an infinite, absolute, eternal, unchangeable, and sovereign Person, comprehending a plan including all his works of all kinds, great and small, from the beginning of creation to an unending eternity; ends as well as means, causes as well as effects, conditions and instrumentalities as well as the events which depend upon them, must be incomprehensible by the finite intellect of man. The decrees are eternal (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 15:18; Eph. 1:4; 2 Thess. 2:13</reflink>), unchangeable (<reflink target="XXX">Ps. 33:11; Isa. 46:9</reflink>), and comprehend all things that come to pass (<reflink target="XXX">Eph. 1:11; Matt. 10:29, 30; Eph. 2:10; Acts 2:23; 4:27, 28; Ps. 17:13, 14</reflink>).</description>
    <description>The decrees of God are (1) efficacious, as they respect those events he has determined to bring about by his own immediate agency; or (2) permissive, as they respect those events he has determined that free agents shall be permitted by him to effect.</description>
    <description>This doctrine ought to produce in our minds "humility, in view of the infinite greatness and sovereignty of God, and of the dependence of man; confidence and implicit reliance upon wisdom, rightenousness, goodness, and immutability of God's purpose."</description>

  <item id="Dedan">
    <description>low ground. (1.) A son of Raamah (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 10:7</reflink>). His descendants are mentioned in Isa. 21:13, and Ezek. 27:15. They probably settled among the sons of Cush, on the north-west coast of the Persian Gulf.</description>
    <description>(2.) A son of Jokshan, Abraham's son by Keturah (<reflink target="XXX">1 Chr. 1:32</reflink>). His descendants settled on the Syrian borders about the territory of Edom. They probably led a pastoral life.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Dedanim">
    <description>the descendants of Dedan, the son of Raamah. They are mentioned in Isa. 21:13 as sending out "travelling companies" which lodged "in the forest of Arabia." They are enumerated also by Ezekiel (27:20) among the merchants who supplied Tyre with precious things.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Dedication, Feast of the">
    <description>(<reflink target="XXX">John 10:22, 42</reflink>), i.e., the feast of the renewing. It was instituted B.C. 164 to commemorate the purging of the temple after its pollution by Antiochus Epiphanes (B.C. 167), and the rebuilding of the altar after the Syrian invaders had been driven out by Judas Maccabaeus. It lasted for eight days, beginning on the 25th of the month Chisleu (December), which was often a period of heavy rains (<reflink target="XXX">Ezra 10:9, 13</reflink>). It was an occasion of much rejoicing and festivity.</description>
    <description>But there were other dedications of the temple. (1) That of Solomon's temple (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 8:2; 2 Chr. 5:3</reflink>); (2) the dedication in the days of Hezekiah (2 Chr. 29); and (3) the dedication of the temple after the Captivity (<reflink target="XXX">Ezra 6:16</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Deep">
    <description>used to denote (1) the grave or the abyss (<reflink target="XXX">Rom. 10:7; Luke 8:31</reflink>); (2) the deepest part of the sea (<reflink target="XXX">Ps. 69:15</reflink>); (3) the chaos mentioned in Gen. 1:2; (4) the bottomless pit, hell (<reflink target="XXX">Rev. 9:1, 2; 11:7; 20:13</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Degrees, Song of">
    <description>song of steps, a title given to each of these fifteen psalms, 120-134 inclusive. The probable origin of this name is the circumstance that these psalms came to be sung by the people on the ascents or goings up to Jerusalem to attend the three great festivals (<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 16:16</reflink>). They were well fitted for being sung by the way from their peculiar form, and from the sentiments they express. "They are characterized by brevity, by a key-word, by epanaphora [i.e, repetition], and by their epigrammatic style...More than half of them are cheerful, and all of them hopeful." They are sometimes called "Pilgrim Songs." Four of them were written by David, one (127) by Solomon, and the rest are anonymous.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Dehavites">
    <description>villagers, one of the Assyrian tribes which Asnapper sent to repopulate Samaria (<reflink target="XXX">Ezra 4:9</reflink>). They were probably a nomad Persian tribe on the east of the Caspian Sea, and near the Sea of Azof.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Delaiah">
    <description>freed by Jehovah. (1.) The head of the twenty-third division of the priestly order (<reflink target="XXX">1 Chr. 24:18</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(2.) A son of Shemaiah, and one of the courtiers to whom Jeremiah's first roll of prophecy was read (<reflink target="XXX">Jer. 36:12</reflink>).</description>

  <item id="Delilah">
    <description>languishing, a Philistine woman who dwelt in the valley of Sorek (<reflink target="XXX">Judg. 16:4-20</reflink>). She was bribed by the "lords of the Philistines" to obtain from Samson the secret of his strength and the means of overcoming it (<reflink target="XXX">Judg. 16:4-18</reflink>). She tried on three occasions to obtain from him this secret in vain. On the fourth occasion she wrung it from him. She made him sleep upon her knees, and then called the man who was waiting to help her; who "cut off the seven locks of his head," and so his "strength went from him." (<see target="x-self">See SAMSON.</see>)</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Deluge">
    <description>the name given to Noah's flood, the history of which is recorded in Gen. 7 and 8.</description>
    <description>It began in the year 2516 B.C., and continued twelve lunar months and ten days, or exactly one solar year.</description>
    <description>The cause of this judgment was the corruption and violence that filled the earth in the ninth generation from Adam. God in righteous indignation determined to purge the earth of the ungodly race. Amid a world of crime and guilt there was one household that continued faithful and true to God, the household of Noah. "Noah was a just man and perfect in his generations."</description>
    <description>At the command of God, Noah made an ark 300 cubits long, 50 broad, and 30 high. He slowly proceeded with this work during a period of one hundred and twenty years (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 6:3</reflink>). At length the purpose of God began to be carried into effect. The following table exhibits the order of events as they occurred:</description>
    <description>In the six hundredth year of his life Noah is commanded by God to enter the ark, taking with him his wife, and his three sons with their wives (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 7:1-10</reflink>).</description>
    <description>The rain begins on the seventeenth day of the second month (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 7:11-17</reflink>).</description>
    <description>The rain ceases, the waters prevail, fifteen cubits upward (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 7:18-24</reflink>).</description>
    <description>The ark grounds on one of the mountains of Ararat on the seventeenth day of the seventh month, or one hundred and fifty days after the Deluge began (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 8:1-4</reflink>).</description>
    <description>Tops of the mountains visible on the first day of the tenth month (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 8:5</reflink>).</description>
    <description>Raven and dove sent out forty days after this (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 8:6-9</reflink>).</description>
    <description>Dove again sent out seven days afterwards; and in the evening she returns with an olive leaf in her mouth (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 8:10, 11</reflink>).</description>
    <description>Dove sent out the third time after an interval of other seven days, and returns no more (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 8:12</reflink>).</description>
    <description>The ground becomes dry on the first day of the first month of the new year (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 8:13</reflink>).</description>
    <description>Noah leaves the ark on the twenty-seventh day of the second month (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 8:14-19</reflink>).</description>
    <description>The historical truth of the narrative of the Flood is established by the references made to it by our Lord (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 24:37; comp. Luke 17:26</reflink>). Peter speaks of it also (<reflink target="XXX">1 Pet. 3:20; 2 Pet. 2:5</reflink>). In Isa. 54:9 the Flood is referred to as "the waters of Noah." The Biblical narrative clearly shows that so far as the human race was concerned the Deluge was universal; that it swept away all men living except Noah and his family, who were preserved in the ark; and that the present human race is descended from those who were thus preserved.</description>
    <description>Traditions of the Deluge are found among all the great divisions of the human family; and these traditions, taken as a whole, wonderfully agree with the Biblical narrative, and agree with it in such a way as to lead to the conclusion that the Biblical is the authentic narrative, of which all these traditions are more or less corrupted versions. The most remarkable of these traditions is that recorded on tablets prepared by order of Assur-bani-pal, the king of Assyria. These were, however, copies of older records which belonged to somewhere about B.C. 2000, and which formed part of the priestly library at Erech (q.v.), "the ineradicable remembrance of a real and terrible event." (<see target="x-self">See NOAH; CHALDEA.</see>)</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Demas">
    <description>a companion and fellow-labourer of Paul during his first imprisonment at Rome (<reflink target="XXX">Philemon 1:24; Col. 4:14</reflink>). It appears, however, that the love of the world afterwards mastered him, and he deserted the apostle (<reflink target="XXX">2 Tim. 4:10</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Demetrius">
    <description>(1.) A silversmith at Ephesus, whose chief occupation was to make "silver shrines for Diana" (q.v.), Acts 19:24,i.e., models either of the temple of Diana or of the statue of the goddess. This trade brought to him and his fellow-craftsmen "no small gain," for these shrines found a ready sale among the countless thousands who came to this temple from all parts of Asia Minor. This traffic was greatly endangered by the progress of the gospel, and hence Demetrius excited the tradesmen employed in the manufacture of these shrines, and caused so great a tumult that "the whole city was filled with confusion."</description>
    <description>(2.) A Christian who is spoken of as having "a good report of all men, and of the truth itself" (<reflink target="XXX">3 John 1:12</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Demon">
    <description>See DAEMON.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Den">
    <description>a lair of wild beasts (<reflink target="XXX">Ps. 10:9; 104:22; Job 37:8</reflink>); the hole of a venomous reptile (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 11:8</reflink>); a recess for secrecy "in dens and caves of the earth" (<reflink target="XXX">Heb. 11:38</reflink>); a resort of thieves (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 21:13; Mark 11:17</reflink>). Daniel was cast into "the den of lions" (<reflink target="XXX">Dan. 6:16, 17</reflink>). Some recent discoveries among the ruins of Babylon have brought to light the fact that the practice of punishing offenders against the law by throwing them into a den of lions was common.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Deputy">
    <description>in 1 Kings 22:47, means a prefect; one set over others. The same Hebrew word is rendered "officer;" i.e., chief of the commissariat appointed by Solomon (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 4:5, etc.</reflink>).</description>
    <description>In Esther 8:9; 9:3 (R.V., "governor") it denotes a Persian prefect "on this side" i.e., in the region west of the Euphrates. It is the modern word _pasha_.</description>
    <description>In Acts 13:7, 8, 12; 18:12, it denotes a proconsul; i.e., the governor of a Roman province holding his appointment from the senate. The Roman provinces were of two kinds, (1) senatorial and (2) imperial. The appointment of a governor to the former was in the hands of the senate, and he bore the title of proconsul (Gr. anthupatos). The appointment of a governor to the latter was in the hands of the emperor, and he bore the title of propraetor (Gr. antistrategos).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Derbe">
    <description>a small town on the eastern part of the upland plain of Lycaonia, about 20 miles from Lystra. Paul passed through Derbe on his route from Cilicia to Iconium, on his second missionary journey (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 16:1</reflink>), and probably also on his third journey (18:23; 19:1). On his first journey (14:20, 21) he came to Derbe from the other side; i.e., from Iconium. It was the native place of Gaius, one of Paul's companions (20:4). He did not here suffer persecution (<reflink target="XXX">2 Tim. 3:11</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Desert">
    <description>(1.) Heb. midbar, "pasture-ground;" an open tract for pasturage; a common (<reflink target="XXX">Joel 2:22</reflink>). The "backside of the desert" (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 3:1</reflink>) is the west of the desert, the region behind a man, as the east is the region in front. The same Hebrew word is rendered "wildernes," and is used of the country lying between Egypt and Palestine (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 21:14, 21; Ex. 4:27; 19:2; Josh. 1:4</reflink>), the wilderness of the wanderings. It was a grazing tract, where the flocks and herds of the Israelites found pasturage during the whole of their journey to the Promised Land.</description>
    <description>The same Hebrew word is used also to denote the wilderness of Arabia, which in winter and early spring supplies good pasturage to the flocks of the nomad tribes than roam over it (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 9:18</reflink>).</description>
    <description>The wilderness of Judah is the mountainous region along the western shore of the Dead Sea, where David fed his father's flocks (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 17:28; 26:2</reflink>). Thus in both of these instances the word denotes a country without settled inhabitants and without streams of water, but having good pasturage for cattle; a country of wandering tribes, as distinguished from that of a settled people (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 35:1; 50:2; Jer. 4:11</reflink>). Such, also, is the meaning of the word "wilderness" in Matt. 3:3; 15:33; Luke 15:4.</description>
    <description>(2.) The translation of the Hebrew _Aribah'_, "an arid tract" (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 35:1, 6; 40:3; 41:19; 51:3, etc.</reflink>). The name Arabah is specially applied to the deep valley of the Jordan (the Ghor of the Arabs), which extends from the lake of Tiberias to the Elanitic gulf. While _midbar_ denotes properly a pastoral region, _arabah_ denotes a wilderness. It is also translated "plains;" as "the plains of Jericho" (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 5:10; 2 Kings 25:5</reflink>), "the plains of Moab" (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 22:1; Deut. 34:1, 8</reflink>), "the plains of the wilderness" (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 17:16</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(3.) In the Revised Version of Num. 21:20 the Hebrew word _jeshimon_ is properly rendered "desert," meaning the waste tracts on both shores of the Dead Sea. This word is also rendered "desert" in Ps. 78:40; 106:14; Isa. 43:19, 20. It denotes a greater extent of uncultivated country than the other words so rendered. It is especially applied to the desert of the peninsula of Arabia (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 21:20; 23:28</reflink>), the most terrible of all the deserts with which the Israelites were acquainted. It is called "the desert" in Ex. 23:31; Deut. 11:24. (See JESHIMON</description>
    <description>(4.) A dry place; hence a desolation (<reflink target="XXX">Ps. 9:6</reflink>), desolate (<reflink target="XXX">Lev. 26:34</reflink>); the rendering of the Hebrew word _horbah'_. It is rendered "desert" only in Ps. 102:6, Isa. 48:21, and Ezek. 13:4, where it means the wilderness of Sinai.</description>
    <description>(5.) This word is the symbol of the Jewish church when they had forsaken God (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 40:3</reflink>). Nations destitute of the knowledge of God are called a "wilderness" (32:15, _midbar_). It is a symbol of temptation, solitude, and persecution (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 27:10, _midbar_; 33:9, _arabah_</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Desire of all nations">
    <description>(<reflink target="XXX">Hag. 2:7</reflink>), usually interpreted as a title of the Messiah. The Revised Version, however, more correctly renders "the desirable things of all nations;" i.e., the choicest treasures of the Gentiles shall be consecrated to the Lord.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Desolation, Abomination of">
    <description>(<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 24:15; Mark 13:14; comp. Luke 21:20</reflink>), is interpreted of the eagles, the standards of the Roman army, which were an abomination to the Jews. These standards, rising over the site of the temple, were a sign that the holy place had fallen under the idolatrous Romans. The references are to Dan. 9:27. (<see target="x-self">See ABOMINATION.</see>)</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Destroyer">
    <description>(<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 12:23</reflink>), the agent employed in the killing of the first-born; the destroying angel or messenger of God. (Comp. 2 Kings 19:35; 2 Sam. 24:15, 16; Ps. 78:49; Acts 12:23.)</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Destruction">
    <description>in Job 26:6, 28:22 (Heb. abaddon) is sheol, the realm of the dead.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Destruction, City of">
    <description>(<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 19:18; Heb. Ir-ha-Heres, "city of overthrow," because of the evidence it would present of the overthrow of heathenism</reflink>), the ideal title of On or Heliopolis (q.v.).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Deuteronomy">
    <description>In all the Hebrew manuscripts the Pentateuch (q.v.) forms one roll or volume divided into larger and smaller sections called _parshioth_ and _sedarim_. It is not easy to say when it was divided into five books. This was probably first done by the Greek translators of the book, whom the Vulgate follows. The fifth of these books was called by the Greeks Deuteronomion, i.e., the second law, hence our name Deuteronomy, or a second statement of the laws already promulgated. The Jews designated the book by the two first Hebrew words that occur, _'Elle haddabharim_, i.e., "These are the words." They divided it into eleven _parshioth_. In the English Bible it contains thirty-four chapters.</description>
    <description>It consists chiefly of three discourses delivered by Moses a short time before his death. They were spoken to all Israel in the plains of Moab, in the eleventh month of the last year of their wanderings.</description>
    <description>The first discourse (1-4:40) recapitulates the chief events of the last forty years in the wilderness, with earnest exhortations to obedience to the divine ordinances, and warnings against the danger of forsaking the God of their fathers.</description>
    <description>The seond discourse (5-26:19) is in effect the body of the whole book. The first address is introductory to it. It contains practically a recapitulation of the law already given by God at Mount Sinai, together with many admonitions and injunctions as to the course of conduct they were to follow when they were settled in Canaan.</description>
    <description>The concluding discourse (ch. 27-30) relates almost wholly to the solemn sanctions of the law, the blessings to the obedient, and the curse that would fall on the rebellious. He solemnly adjures them to adhere faithfully to the covenant God had made with them, and so secure for themselves and their posterity the promised blessings.</description>
    <description>These addresses to the people are followed by what may be called three appendices, namely (1), a song which God had commanded Moses to write (32:1-47); (2) the blessings he pronounced on the separate tribes (ch. 33); and (3) the story of his death (32:48-52) and burial (ch. 34), written by some other hand, probably that of Joshua.</description>
    <description>These farewell addresses of Moses to the tribes of Israel he had so long led in the wilderness "glow in each line with the emotions of a great leader recounting to his contemporaries the marvellous story of their common experience. The enthusiasm they kindle, even to-day, though obscured by translation, reveals their matchless adaptation to the circumstances under which they were first spoken. Confidence for the future is evoked by remembrance of the past. The same God who had done mighty works for the tribes since the Exodus would cover their head in the day of battle with the nations of Palestine, soon to be invaded. Their great lawgiver stands before us, vigorous in his hoary age, stern in his abhorrence of evil, earnest in his zeal for God, but mellowed in all relations to earth by his nearness to heaven. The commanding wisdom of his enactments, the dignity of his position as the founder of the nation and the first of prophets, enforce his utterances. But he touches our deepest emotions by the human tenderness that breathes in all his words. Standing on the verge of life, he speaks as a father giving his parting counsels to those he loves; willing to depart and be with God he has served so well, but fondly lengthening out his last farewell to the dear ones of earth. No book can compare with Deuteronomy in its mingled sublimity and tenderness." Geikie, Hours, etc.</description>
    <description>The whole style and method of this book, its tone and its peculiarities of conception and expression, show that it must have come from one hand. That the author was none other than Moses is established by the following considerations: (1.) The uniform tradition both of the Jewish and the Christian Church down to recent times. (2.) The book professes to have been written by Moses (1:1; 29:1; 31:1, 9-11, etc.), and was obviously intended to be accepted as his work. (3.) The incontrovertible testimony of our Lord and his apostles (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 19:7, 8; Mark 10:3, 4; John 5:46, 47; Acts 3:22; 7:37; Rom. 10:19</reflink>) establishes the same conclusion. (4.) The frequent references to it in the later books of the canon (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 8:31; 1 Kings 2:9; 2 Kings 14:6; 2 Chr. 23:18; 25:4; 34:14; Ezra 3:2; 7:6; Neh. 8:1; Dan. 9:11, 13</reflink>) prove its antiquity; and (5) the archaisms found in it are in harmony with the age in which Moses lived. (6.) Its style and allusions are also strikingly consistent with the circumstances and position of Moses and of the people at that time.</description>
    <description>This body of positive evidence cannot be set aside by the conjectures and reasonings of modern critics, who contended that the book was somewhat like a forgery, introduced among the Jews some seven or eight centuries after the Exodus.</description>

  <item id="Devil">
    <description>(Gr. diabolos), a slanderer, the arch-enemy of man's spiritual interest (<reflink target="XXX">Job 1:6; Rev. 2:10; Zech. 3:1</reflink>). He is called also "the accuser of the brethen" (<reflink target="XXX">Rev. 12:10</reflink>).</description>
    <description>In Lev. 17:7 the word "devil" is the translation of the Hebrew _sair_, meaning a "goat" or "satyr" (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 13:21; 34:14</reflink>), alluding to the wood-daemons, the objects of idolatrous worship among the heathen.</description>
    <description>In Deut. 32:17 and Ps. 106:37 it is the translation of Hebrew _shed_, meaning lord, and idol, regarded by the Jews as a "demon," as the word is rendered in the Revised Version.</description>
    <description>In the narratives of the Gospels regarding the "casting out of devils" a different Greek word (daimon) is used. In the time of our Lord there were frequent cases of demoniacal possession (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 12:25-30; Mark 5:1-20; Luke 4:35; 10:18, etc.</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Dew">
    <description>"There is no dew properly so called in Palestine, for there is no moisture in the hot summer air to be chilled into dew-drops by the coldness of the night. From May till October rain is unknown, the sun shining with unclouded brightness day after day. The heat becomes intense, the ground hard, and vegetation would perish but for the moist west winds that come each night from the sea. The bright skies cause the heat of the day to radiate very quickly into space, so that the nights are as cold as the day is the reverse, a peculiarity of climate from which poor Jacob suffered thousands of years ago (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 31:40</reflink>). To this coldness of the night air the indispensable watering of all plant-life is due. The winds, loaded with moisture, are robbed of it as they pass over the land, the cold air condensing it into drops of water, which fall in a gracious rain of mist on every thirsty blade. In the morning the fog thus created rests like a sea over the plains, and far up the sides of the hills, which raise their heads above it like so many islands. At sunrise, however, the scene speedily changes. By the kindling light the mist is transformed into vast snow-white clouds, which presently break into separate masses and rise up the mountain-sides, to disappear in the blue above, dissipated by the increasing heat. These are 'the morning clouds and the early dew that go away' of which Hosea (6:4; 13:3) speaks so touchingly" (Geikie's The Holy Land, etc., i., p. 72). Dew is a source of great fertility (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 27:28; Deut. 33:13; Zech. 8:12</reflink>), and its withdrawal is regarded as a curse from God (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 1:21; 1 Kings 17:1</reflink>). It is the symbol of a multitude (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 17:12; Ps. 110:3</reflink>); and from its refreshing influence it is an emblem of brotherly love and harmony (<reflink target="XXX">Ps. 133:3</reflink>), and of rich spiritual blessings (<reflink target="XXX">Hos. 14:5</reflink>).</description>

  <item id="Diadem">
    <description>the tiara of a king (<reflink target="XXX">Ezek. 21:26; Isa. 28:5; 62:3</reflink>); the turban (<reflink target="XXX">Job 29:14</reflink>). In the New Testament a careful distinction is drawn between the diadem as a badge of royalty (<reflink target="XXX">Rev. 12:3; 13:1; 19:12</reflink>) and the crown as a mark of distinction in private life. It is not known what the ancient Jewish "diadem" was. It was the mark of Oriental sovereigns. (<see target="x-self">See CROWN.</see>)</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Dial">
    <description>for the measurement of time, only once mentioned in the Bible, erected by Ahaz (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 20:11; Isa. 38:8</reflink>). The Hebrew word (ma'aloth) is rendered "steps" in Ex. 20:26, 1 Kings 10:19, and "degrees" in 2 Kings 20:9, 10, 11. The _ma'aloth_ was probably stairs on which the shadow of a column or obelisk placed on the top fell. The shadow would cover a greater or smaller number of steps, according as the sun was low or high.</description>
    <description>Probably the sun-dial was a Babylonian invention. Daniel at Babylon (<reflink target="XXX">Dan. 3:6</reflink>) is the first to make mention of the "hour."</description>

  <item id="Diamond">
    <description>(1.) A precious gem (Heb. yahalom', in allusion to its hardness), otherwise unknown, the sixth, i.e., the third in the second row, in the breastplate of the high priest, with the name of Naphtali engraven on it (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 28:18; 39:11; R.V. marg., "sardonyx."</reflink>)</description>
    <description>(2.) A precious stone (Heb. shamir', a sharp point) mentioned in Jer. 17:1. From its hardness it was used for cutting and perforating other minerals. It is rendered "adamant" (q.v.) in Ezek. 3:9, Zech. 7:12. It is the hardest and most valuable of precious stones.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Diana">
    <description>so called by the Romans; called Artemis by the Greeks, the "great" goddess worshipped among heathen nations under various modifications. Her most noted temple was that at Ephesus. It was built outside the city walls, and was one of the seven wonders of the ancient world. "First and last it was the work of 220 years; built of shining marble; 342 feet long by 164 feet broad; supported by a forest of columns, each 56 feet high; a sacred museum of masterpieces of sculpture and painting. At the centre, hidden by curtains, within a gorgeous shrine, stood the very ancient image of the goddess, on wood or ebony reputed to have fallen from the sky. Behind the shrine was a treasury, where, as in 'the safest bank in Asia,' nations and kings stored their most precious things. The temple as St. Paul saw it subsisted till A.D. 262, when it was ruined by the Goths" (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 19:23-41</reflink>)., Moule on Ephesians: Introd.</description>

  <item id="Dibon">
    <description>pining; wasting. (1.) A city in Moab (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 21:30</reflink>); called also Dibon-gad (33:45), because it was built by Gad and Dimon (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 15:9</reflink>). It has been identified with the modern Diban, about 3 miles north of the Arnon and 12 miles east of the Dead Sea. (<see target="x-self">See Moabite Stone.</see>)</description>
    <description>(2.) A city of the tribe of Judah, inhabited after the Captivity (<reflink target="XXX">Neh. 11:25</reflink>); called also Dimonah (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 15:22</reflink>). It is probably the modern ed-Dheib.</description>

  <item id="Dinah">
    <description>judged; vindicated, daughter of Jacob by Leah, and sister of Simeon and Levi (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 30:21</reflink>). She was seduced by Shechem, the son of Hamor, the Hivite chief, when Jacob's camp was in the neighbourhood of Shechem. This led to the terrible revenge of Simeon and Levi in putting the Shechemites to death (Gen. 34). Jacob makes frequent reference to this deed of blood with abhorrence and regret (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 34:30; 49:5-7</reflink>). She is mentioned among the rest of Jacob's family that went down into Egypt (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 46:8, 15</reflink>).</description>

  <item id="Dine">
    <description>(<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 43:16</reflink>). It was the custom in Egypt to dine at noon. But it is probable that the Egyptians took their principal meal in the evening, as was the general custom in the East (<reflink target="XXX">Luke 14:12</reflink>).</description>

  <item id="Dinhabah">

  <item id="Disciple">
    <description>a scholar, sometimes applied to the followers of John the Baptist (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 9:14</reflink>), and of the Pharisees (22:16), but principally to the followers of Christ. A disciple of Christ is one who (1) believes his doctrine, (2) rests on his sacrifice, (3) imbibes his spirit, and (4) imitates his example (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 10:24; Luke 14:26, 27, 33; John 6:69</reflink>).</description>

  <item id="Dish">

Judas dipped his hand with a "sop" or piece of bread in the same dish with our Lord, thereby indicating friendly intimacy (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 26:23</reflink>). The "lordly dish" in Judg. 5:25 was probably the shallow drinking cup, usually of brass. In Judg. 6:38 the same Hebrew word is rendered "bowl."</description>

  <item id="Dispensation">
    <description>(Gr. oikonomia, "management," "economy"). (1.) The method or scheme according to which God carries out his purposes towards men is called a dispensation. There are usually reckoned three dispensations, the Patriarchal, the Mosaic or Jewish, and the Christian. (<see target="x-self">See COVENANT, Administration of.</see>) These were so many stages in God's unfolding of his purpose of grace toward men. The word is not found with this meaning in Scripture.</description>
    <description>(2.) A commission to preach the gospel (<reflink target="XXX">1 Cor. 9:17; Eph. 1:10; 3:2; Col. 1:25</reflink>).</description>
    <description>Dispensations of Providence are providential events which affect men either in the way of mercy or of judgement.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Dispersion">
    <description>(Gr. diaspora, "scattered," James 1:1; 1 Pet. 1:1) of the Jews. At various times, and from the operation of divers causes, the Jews were separated and scattered into foreign countries "to the outmost parts of heaven" (<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 30:4</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(1.) Many were dispersed over Assyria, Media, Babylonia, and Persia, descendants of those who had been transported thither by the Exile. The ten tribes, after existing as a separate kingdom for two hundred and fifty-five years, were carried captive (B.C. 721) by Shalmaneser (or Sargon), king of Assyria. They never returned to their own land as a distinct people, although many individuals from among these tribes, there can be no doubt, joined with the bands that returned from Babylon on the proclamation of Cyrus.</description>
    <description>(2.) Many Jews migrated to Egypt and took up their abode there. This migration began in the days of Solomon (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 18:21, 24; Isa. 30:7</reflink>). Alexander the Great placed a large number of Jews in Alexandria, which he had founded, and conferred on them equal rights with the Egyptians. Ptolemy Philadelphus, it is said, caused the Jewish Scriptures to be translated into Greek (the work began B.C. 284), for the use of the Alexandrian Jews. The Jews in Egypt continued for many ages to exercise a powerful influence on the public interests of that country. From Egypt they spread along the coast of Africa to Cyrene (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 2:10</reflink>) and to Ethiopia (8:27).</description>
    <description>(3.) After the time of Seleucus Nicator (B.C. 280), one of the captains of Alexander the Great, large numbers of Jews migrated into Syria, where they enjoyed equal rights with the Macedonians. From Syria they found their way into Asia Minor. Antiochus the Great, king of Syria and Asia, removed 3,000 families of Jews from Mesopotamia and Babylonia, and planted them in Phrygia and Lydia.</description>
    <description>(4.) From Asia Minor many Jews moved into Greece and Macedonia, chiefly for purposes of commerce. In the apostles' time they were found in considerable numbers in all the principal cities.</description>
    <description>From the time of Pompey the Great (B.C. 63) numbers of Jews from Palestine and Greece went to Rome, where they had a separate quarter of the city assigned to them. Here they enjoyed considerable freedom.</description>
    <description>Thus were the Jews everywhere scattered abroad. This, in the overruling providence of God, ultimately contributed in a great degree toward opening the way for the spread of the gospel into all lands.</description>
    <description>Dispersion, from the plain of Shinar. This was occasioned by the confusion of tongues at Babel (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 11:9</reflink>). They were scattered abroad "every one after his tongue, after their families, in their nations" (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 10:5, 20,31</reflink>).</description>
    <description>The tenth chapter of Genesis gives us an account of the principal nations of the earth in their migrations from the plain of Shinar, which was their common residence after the Flood. In general, it may be said that the descendants of Japheth were scattered over the north, those of Shem over the central regions, and those of Ham over the extreme south. The following table shows how the different families were dispersed:</description>
    <description>- Japheth           - Gomer               Cimmerians, Armenians           - Magog               Caucasians, Scythians           - Madal               Medes and Persian tribes           - Javan               - Elishah                   Greeks               - Tarshish                   Etruscans, Romans               - Chittim                   Cyprians, Macedonians               - Dodanim                   Rhodians           - Tubal               Tibareni, Tartars           - Mechech               Moschi, Muscovites           - Tiras               Thracians         - Shem           - Elam               Persian tribes           - Asshur               Assyrian           - Arphaxad               - Abraham                   - Isaac                       - Jacob                           Hebrews                       - Esau                           Edomites                   - Ishmael                       Mingled with Arab tribes           - Lud               Lydians           - Aram               Syrians         - Ham           - Cush               Ethiopans           - Mizrain               Egyptians           - Phut               Lybians, Mauritanians           - Canaan               Canaanites, Phoenicians</description>

  <item id="Divination">
    <description>of false prophets (<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 18:10, 14; Micah 3:6, 7, 11</reflink>), of necromancers (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 28:8</reflink>), of the Philistine priests and diviners (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 6:2</reflink>), of Balaam (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 13:22</reflink>). Three kinds of divination are mentioned in Ezek. 21:21, by arrows, consulting with images (the teraphim), and by examining the entrails of animals sacrificed. The practice of this art seems to have been encouraged in ancient Egypt. Diviners also abounded among the aborigines of Canaan and the Philistines (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 2:6; 1 Sam. 28</reflink>). At a later period multitudes of magicians poured from Chaldea and Arabia into the land of Israel, and pursued their occupations (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 8:19; 2 Kings 21:6; 2 Chr. 33:6</reflink>). This superstition widely spread, and in the time of the apostles there were "vagabond Jews, exorcists" (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 19:13</reflink>), and men like Simon Magus (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 8:9</reflink>), Bar-jesus (13:6, 8), and other jugglers and impostors (19:19; 2 Tim. 3:13). Every species and degree of this superstition was strictly forbidden by the law of Moses (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 22:18; Lev. 19:26, 31; 20:27; Deut. 18:10, 11</reflink>).</description>
    <description>But beyond these various forms of superstition, there are instances of divination on record in the Scriptures by which God was pleased to make known his will.</description>
    <description>(1.) There was divination by lot, by which, when resorted to in matters of moment, and with solemnity, God intimated his will (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 7:13</reflink>). The land of Canaan was divided by lot (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 26:55, 56</reflink>); Achan's guilt was detected (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 7:16-19</reflink>), Saul was elected king (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 10:20, 21</reflink>), and Matthias chosen to the apostleship, by the solem lot (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 1:26</reflink>). It was thus also that the scape-goat was determined (<reflink target="XXX">Lev. 16:8-10</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(2.) There was divination by dreams (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 20:6; Deut. 13:1, 3; Judg. 7:13, 15; Matt. 1:20; 2:12, 13, 19, 22</reflink>). This is illustrated in the history of Joseph (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 41:25-32</reflink>) and of Daniel (2:27; 4:19-28).</description>
    <description>(3.) By divine appointment there was also divination by the Urim and Thummim (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 27:21</reflink>), and by the ephod.</description>
    <description>(4.) God was pleased sometimes to vouch-safe direct vocal communications to men (<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 34:10; Ex. 3:4; 4:3; Deut. 4:14, 15; 1 Kings 19:12</reflink>). He also communed with men from above the mercy-seat (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 25:22</reflink>), and at the door of the tabernacle (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 29:42, 43</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(5.) Through his prophets God revealed himself, and gave intimations of his will (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 13:17; Jer. 51:63, 64</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Divorce">
    <description>The dissolution of the marriage tie was regulated by the Mosaic law (<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 24:1-4</reflink>). The Jews, after the Captivity, were reguired to dismiss the foreign women they had married contrary to the law (<reflink target="XXX">Ezra 10:11-19</reflink>). Christ limited the permission of divorce to the single case of adultery. It seems that it was not uncommon for the Jews at that time to dissolve the union on very slight pretences (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 5:31, 32; 19:1-9; Mark 10:2-12; Luke 16:18</reflink>). These precepts given by Christ regulate the law of divorce in the Christian Church.</description>

  <item id="Doctor">
    <description>(<reflink target="XXX">Luke 2:46; 5:17; Acts 5:34</reflink>), a teacher. The Jewish doctors taught and disputed in synagogues, or wherever they could find an audience. Their disciples were allowed to propose to them questions. They assumed the office without any appointment to it. The doctors of the law were principally of the sect of the Pharisees. Schools were established after the destruction of Jerusalem at Babylon and Tiberias, in which academical degrees were conferred on those who passed a certain examination. Those of the school of Tiberias were called by the title "rabbi," and those of Babylon by that of "master."</description>

  <item id="Dog">
    <description>frequently mentioned both in the Old and New Testaments. Dogs were used by the Hebrews as a watch for their houses (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 56:10</reflink>), and for guarding their flocks (<reflink target="XXX">Job 30:1</reflink>). There were also then as now troops of semi-wild dogs that wandered about devouring dead bodies and the offal of the streets (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 14:11; 16:4; 21:19, 23; 22:38; Ps. 59:6, 14</reflink>).</description>
    <description>As the dog was an unclean animal, the terms "dog," "dog's head," "dead dog," were used as terms of reproach or of humiliation (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 24:14; 2 Sam. 3:8; 9:8; 16:9</reflink>). Paul calls false apostles "dogs" (<reflink target="XXX">Phil. 3:2</reflink>). Those who are shut out of the kingdom of heaven are also so designated (<reflink target="XXX">Rev. 22:15</reflink>). Persecutors are called "dogs" (<reflink target="XXX">Ps. 22:16</reflink>). Hazael's words, "Thy servant which is but a dog" (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 8:13</reflink>), are spoken in mock humility=impossible that one so contemptible as he should attain to such power.</description>

  <item id="Doleful creatures">
    <description>(<reflink target="XXX">occurring only Isa. 13:21. Heb. ochim, i.e., "shrieks;" hence "howling animals"</reflink>), a general name for screech owls (howlets), which occupy the desolate palaces of Babylon. Some render the word "hyaenas."</description>

  <item id="Door-keeper">
    <description>This word is used in Ps. 84:10 (R.V. marg., "stand at the threshold of," etc.), but there it signifies properly "sitting at the threshold in the house of God." The psalmist means that he would rather stand at the door of God's house and merely look in, than dwell in houses where iniquity prevailed.</description>
    <description>Persons were appointed to keep the street door leading into the interior of the house (<reflink target="XXX">John 18:16, 17; Acts 12:13</reflink>). Sometimes females held this post.</description>

  <item id="Door-posts">
    <description>The Jews were commanded to write the divine name on the posts (mezuzoth') of their doors (<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 6:9</reflink>). The Jews, misunderstanding this injunction, adopted the custom of writing on a slip of parchment these verses (<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 6:4-9, and 11:13-21</reflink>), which they enclosed in a reed or cylinder and fixed on the right-hand door-post of every room in the house.</description>

In the interior of Oriental houses, curtains were frequently used instead of doors.</description>
    <description>The entrances of the tabernacle had curtains (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 26:31-33, 36</reflink>). The "valley of Achor" is called a "door of hope," because immediately after the execution of Achan the Lord said to Joshua, "Fear not," and from that time Joshua went forward in a career of uninterrupted conquest. Paul speaks of a "door opened" for the spread of the gospel (<reflink target="XXX">1 Cor. 16:9; 2 Cor. 2:12; Col. 4:3</reflink>). Our Lord says of himself, "I am the door" (<reflink target="XXX">John 10:9</reflink>). John (<reflink target="XXX">Rev. 4:1</reflink>) speaks of a "door opened in heaven."</description>

  <item id="Dophkah">
    <description>knocking, an encampment of the Israelites in the wilderness (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 33:12</reflink>). It was in the desert of Sin, on the eastern shore of the western arm of the Red Sea, somewhere in the Wady Feiran.</description>

  <item id="Dor">
    <description>dwelling, the Dora of the Romans, an ancient royal city of the Canaanites (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 11:1, 2; 12:23</reflink>). It was the most southern settlement of the Phoenicians on the coast of Syria. The original inhabitants seem never to have been expelled, although they were made tributary by David. It was one of Solomon's commissariat districts (<reflink target="XXX">Judg. 1:27; 1 Kings 4:11</reflink>). It has been identified with Tantura (so named from the supposed resemblance of its tower to a tantur, i.e., "a horn"). This tower fell in 1895, and nothing remains but debris and foundation walls, the remains of an old Crusading fortress. It is about 8 miles north of Caesarea, "a sad and sickly hamlet of wretched huts on a naked sea-beach."</description>

  <item id="Dorcas">
    <description>a female antelope, or gazelle, a pious Christian widow at Joppa whom Peter restored to life (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 9:36-41</reflink>). She was a Hellenistic Jewess, called Tabitha by the Jews and Dorcas by the Greeks.</description>

  <item id="Dothan">
    <description>two wells, a famous pasture-ground where Joseph found his brethren watching their flocks. Here, at the suggestion of Judah, they sold him to the Ishmaelite merchants (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 37:17</reflink>). It is mentioned on monuments in B.C. 1600.</description>
    <description>It was the residence of Elisha (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 6:13</reflink>), and the scene of a remarkable vision of chariots and horses of fire surrounding the mountain on which the city stood. It is identified with the modern Tell-Dothan, on the south side of the plain of Jezreel, about 12 miles north of Samaria, among the hills of Gilboa. The "two wells" are still in existence, one of which bears the name of the "pit of Joseph" (Jubb Yusuf).</description>

  <item id="Dough">
    <description>(batsek, meaning "swelling," i.e., in fermentation). The dough the Israelites had prepared for baking was carried away by them out of Egypt in their kneading-troughs (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 12:34, 39</reflink>). In the process of baking, the dough had to be turned (<reflink target="XXX">Hos. 7:8</reflink>).</description>

  <item id="Dove">
    <description>In their wild state doves generally build their nests in the clefts of rocks, but when domesticated "dove-cots" are prepared for them (<reflink target="XXX">Cant. 2:14; Jer. 48:28; Isa. 60:8</reflink>). The dove was placed on the standards of the Assyrians and Babylonians in honour, it is supposed, of Semiramis (<reflink target="XXX">Jer. 25:38; Vulg., "fierceness of the dove;" comp. Jer. 46:16; 50:16</reflink>). Doves and turtle-doves were the only birds that could be offered in sacrifice, as they were clean according to the Mosaic law (<reflink target="XXX">Ge. 15:9; Lev. 5:7; 12:6; Luke 2:24</reflink>). The dove was the harbinger of peace to Noah (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 8:8, 10</reflink>). It is often mentioned as the emblem of purity (<reflink target="XXX">Ps. 68:13</reflink>). It is a symbol of the Holy Spirit (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 1:2; Matt. 3:16; Mark 1:10; Luke 3:22; John 1:32</reflink>); also of tender and devoted affection (<reflink target="XXX">Cant. 1:15; 2:14</reflink>). David in his distress wished that he had the wings of a dove, that he might fly away and be at rest (<reflink target="XXX">Ps. 55:6-8</reflink>). There is a species of dove found at Damascus "whose feathers, all except the wings, are literally as yellow as gold" (68:13).</description>

  <item id="Dove's dung">
    <description>(<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 6:25</reflink>) has been generally understood literally. There are instances in history of the dung of pigeons being actually used as food during a famine. Compare also the language of Rabshakeh to the Jews (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 18:27; Isa. 36:12</reflink>). This name, however, is applied by the Arabs to different vegetable substances, and there is room for the opinion of those who think that some such substance is here referred to, as, e.g., the seeds of a kind of millet, or a very inferior kind of pulse, or the root of the ornithogalum, i.e., bird-milk, the star-of-Bethlehem.</description>

  <item id="Dowry">
    <description>(mohar; i.e., price paid for a wife, Gen. 34:12; Ex. 22:17; 1 Sam. 18:25), a nuptial present; some gift, as a sum of money, which the bridegroom offers to the father of his bride as a satisfaction before he can receive her. Jacob had no dowry to give for his wife, but he gave his services (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 29:18; 30:20; 34:12</reflink>).</description>

  <item id="Dragon">
    <description>(1.) Heb. tannim, plural of tan. The name of some unknown creature inhabiting desert places and ruins (<reflink target="XXX">Job 30:29; Ps. 44:19; Isa. 13:22; 34:13; 43:20; Jer. 10:22; Micah 1:8; Mal. 1:3</reflink>); probably, as translated in the Revised Version, the jackal (q.v.).</description>
    <description>(2.) Heb. tannin. Some great sea monster (<reflink target="XXX">Jer. 51:34</reflink>). In Isa. 51:9 it may denote the crocodile. In Gen. 1:21 (Heb. plural tanninim) the Authorized Version renders "whales," and the Revised Version "sea monsters." It is rendered "serpent" in Ex. 7:9. It is used figuratively in Ps. 74:13; Ezek. 29:3.</description>
    <description>In the New Testament the word "dragon" is found only in Rev. 12:3, 4, 7, 9, 16, 17, etc., and is there used metaphorically of "Satan." (<see target="x-self">See WHALE.</see>)</description>

    <description>The Authorized Version understood the word 'adarkonim (<reflink target="XXX">1 Chr. 29:7; Ezra 8:27</reflink>), and the similar word darkomnim (<reflink target="XXX">Ezra 2:69; Neh. 7:70</reflink>), as equivalent to the Greek silver coin the drachma. But the Revised Version rightly regards it as the Greek dareikos, a Persian gold coin (the daric) of the value of about 1 pound, 2s., which was first struck by Darius, the son of Hystaspes, and was current in Western Asia long after the fall of the Persian empire.

  <item id="Dream">
    <description>God has frequently made use of dreams in communicating his will to men. The most remarkable instances of this are recorded in the history of Jacob (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 28:12; 31:10</reflink>), Laban (31:24), Joseph (37:9-11), Gideon (Judg. 7), and Solomon (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 3:5</reflink>). Other significant dreams are also recorded, such as those of Abimelech (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 20:3-7</reflink>), Pharaoh's chief butler and baker (40:5), Pharaoh (41:1-8), the Midianites (<reflink target="XXX">Judg. 7:13</reflink>), Nebuchadnezzar (<reflink target="XXX">Dan. 2:1; 4:10, 18</reflink>), the wise men from the east (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 2:12</reflink>), and Pilate's wife (27:19).</description>
    <description>To Joseph "the Lord appeared in a dream," and gave him instructions regarding the infant Jesus (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 1:20; 2:12, 13, 19</reflink>). In a vision of the night a "man of Macedonia" stood before Paul and said, "Come over into Macedonia and help us" (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 16:9; see also 18:9; 27:23</reflink>).</description>

  </item>
  <item id="Dress">
    <description>(1.) Materials used. The earliest and simplest an apron of fig-leaves sewed together (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 3:7</reflink>); then skins of animals (3:21). Elijah's dress was probably the skin of a sheep (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 1:8</reflink>). The Hebrews were early acquainted with the art of weaving hair into cloth (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 26:7; 35:6</reflink>), which formed the sackcloth of mourners. This was the material of John the Baptist's robe (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 3:4</reflink>). Wool was also woven into garments (<reflink target="XXX">Lev. 13:47; Deut. 22:11; Ezek. 34:3; Job 31:20; Prov. 27:26</reflink>). The Israelites probably learned the art of weaving linen when they were in Egypt (<reflink target="XXX">1 Chr. 4:21</reflink>). Fine linen was used in the vestments of the high priest (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 28:5</reflink>), as well as by the rich (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 41:42; Prov. 31:22; Luke 16:19</reflink>). The use of mixed material, as wool and flax, was forbidden (<reflink target="XXX">Lev. 19:19; Deut. 22:11</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(2.) Colour. The prevailing colour was the natural white of the material used, which was sometimes rendered purer by the fuller's art (<reflink target="XXX">Ps. 104:1, 2; Isa. 63:3; Mark 9:3</reflink>). The Hebrews were acquainted with the art of dyeing (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 37:3, 23</reflink>). Various modes of ornamentation were adopted in the process of weaving (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 28:6; 26:1, 31; 35:25</reflink>), and by needle-work (<reflink target="XXX">Judg. 5:30; Ps. 45:13</reflink>). Dyed robes were imported from foreign countries, particularly from Phoenicia (<reflink target="XXX">Zeph. 1:8</reflink>). Purple and scarlet robes were the marks of the wealthy (<reflink target="XXX">Luke 16:19; 2 Sam. 1:24</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(3.) Form. The robes of men and women were not very much different in form from each other.</description>
    <description>(a) The "coat" (kethoneth), of wool, cotton, or linen, was worn by both sexes. It was a closely-fitting garment, resembling in use and form our shirt (<reflink target="XXX">John 19:23</reflink>). It was kept close to the body by a girdle (<reflink target="XXX">John 21:7</reflink>). A person wearing this "coat" alone was described as naked (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 19:24; Isa. 20:2; 2 Kings 6:30; John 21:7</reflink>); deprived of it he would be absolutely naked.</description>
    <description>(b) A linen cloth or wrapper (sadin) of fine linen, used somewhat as a night-shirt (<reflink target="XXX">Mark 14:51</reflink>). It is mentioned in Judg. 14:12, 13, and rendered there "sheets."</description>
    <description>(c) An upper tunic (meil), longer than the "coat" (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 2:19; 24:4; 28:14</reflink>). In 1 Sam. 28:14 it is the mantle in which Samuel was enveloped; in 1 Sam. 24:4 it is the "robe" under which Saul slept. The disciples were forbidden to wear two "coats" (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 10:10; Luke 9:3</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(d) The usual outer garment consisted of a piece of woollen cloth like a Scotch plaid, either wrapped round the body or thrown over the shoulders like a shawl, with the ends hanging down in front, or it might be thrown over the head so as to conceal the face (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 15:30; Esther 6:12</reflink>). It was confined to the waist by a girdle, and the fold formed by the overlapping of the robe served as a pocket (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 4:39; Ps. 79:12; Hag. 2:12; Prov. 17:23; 21:14</reflink>).</description>
    <description>Female dress. The "coat" was common to both sexes (<reflink target="XXX">Cant. 5:3</reflink>). But peculiar to females were (1) the "veil" or "wimple," a kind of shawl (<reflink target="XXX">Ruth 3:15; rendered "mantle," R.V., Isa. 3:22</reflink>); (2) the "mantle," also a species of shawl (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 3:22</reflink>); (3) a "veil," probably a light summer dress (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 24:65</reflink>); (4) a "stomacher," a holiday dress (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 3:24</reflink>). The outer garment terminated in an ample fringe or border, which concealed the feet (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 47:2; Jer. 13:22</reflink>).</description>
    <description>The dress of the Persians is described in Dan. 3:21.</description>
    <description>The reference to the art of sewing are few, inasmuch as the garments generally came forth from the loom ready for being worn, and all that was required in the making of clothes devolved on the women of a family (<reflink target="XXX">Prov. 31:22; Acts 9:39</reflink>).</description>
    <description>Extravagance in dress is referred to in Jer. 4:30; Ezek. 16:10; Zeph. 1:8 (R.V., "foreign apparel"); 1 Tim. 2:9; 1 Pet. 3:3. Rending the robes was expressive of grief (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 37:29, 34</reflink>), fear (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 21:27</reflink>), indignation (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 5:7</reflink>), or despair (<reflink target="XXX">Judg. 11:35; Esther 4:1</reflink>).</description>
    <description>Shaking the garments, or shaking the dust from off them, was a sign of renunciation (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 18:6</reflink>); wrapping them round the head, of awe (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 19:13</reflink>) or grief (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 15:30; casting them off, of excitement (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 22:23</reflink></reflink>); laying hold of them, of supplication (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 15:27</reflink>). In the case of travelling, the outer garments were girded up (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 18:46</reflink>). They were thrown aside also when they would impede action (<reflink target="XXX">Mark 10:50; John 13:4; Acts 7:58</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Drink">
    <description>The drinks of the Hebrews were water, wine, "strong drink," and vinegar. Their drinking vessels were the cup, goblet or "basin," the "cruse" or pitcher, and the saucer.</description>
    <description>To drink water by measure (<reflink target="XXX">Ezek. 4:11</reflink>), and to buy water to drink (<reflink target="XXX">Lam. 5:4</reflink>), denote great scarcity. To drink blood means to be satiated with slaughter.</description>
    <description>The Jews carefully strained their drinks through a sieve, through fear of violating the law of Lev. 11:20, 23, 41, 42. (<reflink target="XXX">See Matt. 23:24. "Strain at" should be "strain out."</reflink>)</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Drink, strong">
    <description>(Heb. shekar'), an intoxicating liquor (<reflink target="XXX">Judg. 13:4; Luke 1:15; Isa. 5:11; Micah 2:11</reflink>) distilled from corn, honey, or dates. The effects of the use of strong drink are referred to in Ps. 107:27; Isa. 24:20; 49:26; 51:17-22. Its use prohibited, Prov. 20:1. (<see target="x-self">See WINE.</see>)</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Drink-offering">
    <description>consisted of wine (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 15:5; Hos. 9:4</reflink>) poured around the altar (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 30:9</reflink>). Joined with meat-offerings (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 6:15, 17; 2 Kings 16:13; Joel 1:9, 13; 2:14</reflink>), presented daily (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 29:40</reflink>), on the Sabbath (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 28:9</reflink>), and on feast-days (28:14). One-fourth of an hin of wine was required for one lamb, one-third for a ram, and one-half for a bullock (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 15:5; 28:7, 14</reflink>). "Drink offerings of blood" (<reflink target="XXX">Ps. 16:4</reflink>) is used in allusion to the heathen practice of mingling the blood of animals sacrificed with wine or water, and pouring out the mixture in the worship of the gods, and the idea conveyed is that the psalmist would not partake of the abominations of the heathen.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Dromedary">
    <description>(<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 60:6</reflink>), an African or Arabian species of camel having only one hump, while the Bactrian camel has two. It is distinguished from the camel only as a trained saddle-horse is distinguished from a cart-horse. It is remarkable for its speed (<reflink target="XXX">Jer. 2:23</reflink>). Camels are frequently spoken of in partriarchal times (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 12:16; 24:10; 30:43; 31:17, etc.</reflink>). They were used for carrying burdens (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 37:25; Judg. 6:5</reflink>), and for riding (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 24:64</reflink>). The hair of the camel falls off of itself in spring, and is woven into coarse cloths and garments (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 3:4</reflink>). (See CAMEL</description>

    <description>the impurities of silver separated from the one in the process of melting (<reflink target="XXX">Prov. 25:4; 26:23; Ps. 119:119</reflink>). It is also used to denote the base metal itself, probably before it is smelted, in Isa. 1:22, 25.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Drought">
    <description>From the middle of May to about the middle of August the land of Palestine is dry. It is then the "drought of summer" (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 31:40; Ps. 32:4</reflink>), and the land suffers (<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 28:23: Ps. 102:4</reflink>), vegetation being preserved only by the dews (<reflink target="XXX">Hag. 1:11</reflink>).

  </item>
  <item id="Drown">
    <description>(<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 15:4; Amos 8:8; Heb. 11:29</reflink>). Drowning was a mode of capital punishment in use among the Syrians, and was known to the Jews in the time of our Lord. To this he alludes in Matt. 18:6.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Drunk">
    <description>The first case of intoxication on record is that of Noah (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 9:21</reflink>). The sin of drunkenness is frequently and strongly condemned (<reflink target="XXX">Rom. 13:13; 1 Cor. 6:9, 10; Eph. 5:18; 1 Thess. 5:7, 8</reflink>). The sin of drinking to excess seems to have been not uncommon among the Israelites.</description>
    <description>The word is used figuratively, when men are spoken of as being drunk with sorrow, and with the wine of God's wrath (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 63:6; Jer. 51:57; Ezek. 23:33</reflink>). To "add drunkenness to thirst" (<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 29:19, A.V.</reflink>) is a proverbial expression, rendered in the Revised Version "to destroy the moist with the dry", i.e., the well-watered equally with the dry land, meaning that the effect of such walking in the imagination of their own hearts would be to destroy one and all.</description>

Felix, the Roman procurator of Judea, induced her to leave her husband, Azizus, the king of Emesa, and become his wife. She was present with Felix when Paul reasoned of "righteousness, temperance, and judgment to come" (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 24:24</reflink>). She and her son perished in the eruption of Mount Vesuvius, A.D. 79.</description>

  <item id="Duke">
    <description>derived from the Latin dux, meaning "a leader;" Arabic, "a sheik." This word is used to denote the phylarch or chief of a tribe (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 36:15-43; Ex. 15:15; 1 Chr. 1:51-54</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Dulcimer">
    <description>(Heb. sumphoniah), a musical instrument mentioned in Dan. 3:5, 15, along with other instruments there named, as sounded before the golden image. It was not a Jewish instrument. In the margin of the Revised Version it is styled the "bag-pipe." Luther translated it "lute," and Grotius the "crooked trumpet." It is probable that it was introduced into Babylon by some Greek or Western-Asiatic musician. Some Rabbinical commentators render it by "organ," the well-known instrument composed of a series of pipes, others by "lyre." The most probable interpretation is that it was a bag-pipe similar to the zampagna of Southern Europe.</description>

    <description>silence, (<reflink target="XXX">comp. Ps. 94:17</reflink>), the fourth son of Ishmael; also the tribe descended from him; and hence also the region in Arabia which they inhabited (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 25:14; 1 Chr. 1:30</reflink>).</description>
    <description>There was also a town of this name in Judah (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 15:52</reflink>), which has been identified with ed-Domeh, about 10 miles southwest of Hebron. The place mentioned in the "burden" of the prophet Isaiah (21:11) is Edom or Idumea.</description>

  <item id="Dumb">
    <description>from natural infirmity (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 4:11</reflink>); not knowing what to say (<reflink target="XXX">Prov. 31:8</reflink>); unwillingness to speak (<reflink target="XXX">Ps. 39:9; Lev. 10:3</reflink>). Christ repeatedly restored the dumb (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 9:32, 33; Luke 11:14; Matt. 12:22</reflink>) to the use of speech.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Dung">
    <description>(1.) Used as manure (<reflink target="XXX">Luke 13:8</reflink>); collected outside the city walls (<reflink target="XXX">Neh. 2:13</reflink>). Of sacrifices, burned outside the camp (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 29:14; Lev. 4:11; 8:17; Num. 19:5</reflink>). To be "cast out as dung," a figurative expression (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 14:10; 2 Kings 9:37; Jer. 8:2; Ps. 18:42</reflink>), meaning to be rejected as unprofitable.</description>
    <description>(2.) Used as fuel, a substitute for firewood, which was with difficulty procured in Syria, Arabia, and Egypt (<reflink target="XXX">Ezek. 4:12-15</reflink>), where cows' and camels' dung is used to the present day for this purpose.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Dung-gate">
    <description>(<reflink target="XXX">Neh. 2:13</reflink>), a gate of ancient Jerusalem, on the south-west quarter. "The gate outside of which lay the piles of sweepings and offscourings of the streets," in the valley of Tophet.</description>

  <item id="Dung-hill">
    <description>to sit on a, was a sign of the deepest dejection (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 2:8; Ps. 113:7; Lam. 4:5</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Dungeon">
    <description>different from the ordinary prison in being more severe as a place of punishment. Like the Roman inner prison (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 16:24</reflink>), it consisted of a deep cell or cistern (<reflink target="XXX">Jer. 38:6</reflink>). To be shut up in, a punishment common in Egypt (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 39:20; 40:3; 41:10; 42:19</reflink>). It is not mentioned, however, in the law of Moses as a mode of punishment. Under the later kings imprisonment was frequently used as a punishment (<reflink target="XXX">2 Chron. 16:10; Jer. 20:2; 32:2; 33:1; 37:15</reflink>), and it was customary after the Exile (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 11:2; Luke 3:20; Acts 5:18, 21; Matt. 18:30</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Dura">
    <description>the circle, the plain near Babylon in which Nebuchadnezzar set up a golden image, mentioned in Dan. 3:1. The place still retains its ancient name. On one of its many mounds the pedestal of what must have been a colossal statue has been found. It has been supposed to be that of the golden image.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Dust">
    <description>Storms of sand and dust sometimes overtake Eastern travellers. They are very dreadful, many perishing under them. Jehovah threatens to bring on the land of Israel, as a punishment for forsaking him, a rain of "powder and dust" (<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 28:24</reflink>).</description>
    <description>To cast dust on the head was a sign of mourning (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 7:6</reflink>); and to sit in dust, of extreme affliction (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 47:1</reflink>). "Dust" is used to denote the grave (<reflink target="XXX">Job 7:21</reflink>). "To shake off the dust from one's feet" against another is to renounce all future intercourse with him (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 10:14; Acts 13:51</reflink>). To "lick the dust" is a sign of abject submission (<reflink target="XXX">Ps. 72:9</reflink>); and to throw dust at one is a sign of abhorrence (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 16:13; comp. Acts 22:23</reflink>).</description>

  <item id="Dwarf">
    <description>a lean or emaciated person (<reflink target="XXX">Lev. 21:20</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Dwell">
    <description>Tents were in primitive times the common dwellings of men. Houses were afterwards built, the walls of which were frequently of mud (<reflink target="XXX">Job 24:16; Matt. 6:19, 20</reflink>) or of sun-dried bricks.</description>
    <description>God "dwells in light" (<reflink target="XXX">1 Tim. 6:16; 1 John 1:7</reflink>), in heaven (<reflink target="XXX">Ps. 123:1</reflink>), in his church (<reflink target="XXX">Ps. 9:11; 1 John 4:12</reflink>). Christ dwelt on earth in the days of his humiliation (<reflink target="XXX">John 1:14</reflink>). He now dwells in the hearts of his people (<reflink target="XXX">Eph. 3:17-19</reflink>). The Holy Spirit dwells in believers (<reflink target="XXX">1 Cor. 3:16; 2 Tim. 1:14</reflink>). We are exhorted to "let the word of God dwell in us richly" (<reflink target="XXX">Col. 3:16; Ps. 119:11</reflink>).</description>
    <description>Dwell deep occurs only in Jer. 49:8, and refers to the custom of seeking refuge from impending danger, in retiring to the recesses of rocks and caverns, or to remote places in the desert.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Dwellings">
    <description>The materials used in buildings were commonly bricks, sometimes also stones (<reflink target="XXX">Lev. 14:40, 42</reflink>), which were held together by cement (<reflink target="XXX">Jer. 43:9</reflink>) or bitumen (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 11:3</reflink>). The exterior was usually whitewashed (<reflink target="XXX">Lev. 14:41; Ezek. 13:10; Matt. 23:27</reflink>). The beams were of sycamore (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 9:10</reflink>), or olive-wood, or cedar (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 7:2; Isa. 9:10</reflink>).</description>
    <description>The form of Eastern dwellings differed in many respects from that of dwellings in Western lands. The larger houses were built in a quadrangle enclosing a court-yard (<reflink target="XXX">Luke 5:19; 2 Sam. 17:18; Neh. 8:16</reflink>) surrounded by galleries, which formed the guest-chamber or reception-room for visitors. The flat roof, surrounded by a low parapet, was used for many domestic and social purposes. It was reached by steps from the court. In connection with it (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 23:12</reflink>) was an upper room, used as a private chamber (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam 18:33; Dan. 6:11</reflink>), also as a bedroom (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 23:12</reflink>), a sleeping apartment for guests (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 4:10</reflink>), and as a sick-chamber (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 17:19</reflink>). The doors, sometimes of stone, swung on morticed pivots, and were generally fastened by wooden bolts. The houses of the more wealthy had a doorkeeper or a female porter (<reflink target="XXX">John 18:16; Acts 12:13</reflink>). The windows generally opened into the courtyard, and were closed by a lattice (<reflink target="XXX">Judg. 5:28</reflink>). The interior rooms were set apart for the female portion of the household.</description>
    <description>The furniture of the room (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 4:10</reflink>) consisted of a couch furnished with pillows (<reflink target="XXX">Amos 6:4; Ezek. 13:20</reflink>); and besides this, chairs, a table and lanterns or lamp-stands (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 4:10</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Dye">
    <description>The art of dyeing is one of great antiquity, although no special mention is made of it in the Old Testament. The Hebrews probably learned it from the Egyptians (<reflink target="XXX">see Ex. 26:1; 28:5-8</reflink>), who brought it to great perfection. In New Testament times Thyatira was famed for its dyers (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 16:14</reflink>). (<see target="x-self">See COLOUR.</see>)</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Eagle">
    <description>(Herb. nesher; properly the griffon vulture or great vulture, so called from its tearing its prey with its beak), referred to for its swiftness of flight (<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 28:49; 2 Sam. 1:23</reflink>), its mounting high in the air (<reflink target="XXX">Job 39:27</reflink>), its strength (<reflink target="XXX">Ps. 103:5</reflink>), its setting its nest in high places (<reflink target="XXX">Jer. 49:16</reflink>), and its power of vision (<reflink target="XXX">Job 39:27-30</reflink>).</description>
    <description>This "ravenous bird" is a symbol of those nations whom God employs and sends forth to do a work of destruction, sweeping away whatever is decaying and putrescent (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 24:28; Isa. 46:11; Ezek. 39:4; Deut. 28:49; Jer. 4:13; 48:40</reflink>). It is said that the eagle sheds his feathers in the beginning of spring, and with fresh plumage assumes the appearance of youth. To this, allusion is made in Ps. 103:5 and Isa. 40:31. God's care over his people is likened to that of the eagle in training its young to fly (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 19:4; Deut. 32:11, 12</reflink>). An interesting illustration is thus recorded by Sir Humphry Davy:, "I once saw a very interesting sight above the crags of Ben Nevis. Two parent eagles were teaching their offspring, two young birds, the maneuvers of flight. They began by rising from the top of the mountain in the eye of the sun. It was about mid-day, and bright for the climate. They at first made small circles, and the young birds imitated them. They paused on their wings, waiting till they had made their flight, and then took a second and larger gyration, always rising toward the sun, and enlarging their circle of flight so as to make a gradually ascending spiral. The young ones still and slowly followed, apparently flying better as they mounted; and they continued this sublime exercise, always rising till they became mere points in the air, and the young ones were lost, and afterwards their parents, to our aching sight." (<reflink target="XXX">See Isa. 40:31.</reflink>)</description>
    <description>There have been observed in Palestine four distinct species of eagles, (1) the golden eagle (Aquila chrysaetos); (2) the spotted eagle (Aquila naevia); (3) the common species, the imperial eagle (Aquila heliaca); and (4) the Circaetos gallicus, which preys on reptiles. The eagle was unclean by the Levitical law (<reflink target="XXX">Lev. 11:13; Deut. 14:12</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Ear">
    <description>used frequently in a figurative sense (<reflink target="XXX">Ps. 34:15</reflink>). To "uncover the ear" is to show respect to a person (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 20:2 marg.</reflink>). To have the "ear heavy", or to have "uncircumcised ears" (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 6:10</reflink>), is to be inattentive and disobedient. To have the ear "bored" through with an awl was a sign of perpetual servitude (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 21:6</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Earing">
    <description>an Old English word (from the Latin aro, I plough), meaning "ploughing." It is used in the Authorized Version in Gen. 45:6; Ex. 34:21; 1 Sam. 8:12; Deut. 21:4; Isa. 30:24; but the Revised Version has rendered the original in these places by the ordinary word to plough or till.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Earnest">
    <description>The Spirit is the earnest of the believer's destined inheritance (<reflink target="XXX">2 Cor. 1:22; 5:5; Eph. 1:14</reflink>). The word thus rendered is the same as that rendered "pledge" in Gen. 38:17-20; "indeed, the Hebrew word has simply passed into the Greek and Latin languages, probably through commercial dealings with the Phoenicians, the great trading people of ancient days. Originally it meant no more than a pledge; but in common usage it came to denote that particular kind of pledge which is a part of the full price of an article paid in advance; and as it is joined with the figure of a seal when applied to the Spirit, it seems to be used by Paul in this specific sense." The Spirit's gracious presence and working in believers is a foretaste to them of the blessedness of heaven. God is graciously pleased to give not only pledges but foretastes of future blessedness.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Earrings">
    <description>rings properly for the ear (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 35:4; Num. 31:50; Ezek. 16:12</reflink>). In Gen. 24:47 the word means a nose-jewel, and is so rendered in the Revised Version. In Isa. 3:20 the Authorized Version has "ear-rings," and the Revised Version "amulets," which more correctly represents the original word (lehashim), which means incantations; charms, thus remedies against enchantment, worn either suspended from the neck or in the ears of females. Ear-rings were ornaments used by both sexes (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 32:2</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Earth">
    <description>(1.) In the sense of soil or ground, the translation of the word _adamah'_. In Gen. 9:20 "husbandman" is literally "man of the ground or earth." Altars were to be built of earth (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 20:24</reflink>). Naaman asked for two mules' burden of earth (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 5:17</reflink>), under the superstitious notion that Jehovah, like the gods of the heathen, could be acceptably worshipped only on his own soil.</description>
    <description>(2). As the rendering of _'erets_, it means the whole world (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 1:2</reflink>); the land as opposed to the sea (1:10). _Erets_ also denotes a country (21:32); a plot of ground (23:15); the ground on which a man stands (33:3); the inhabitants of the earth (6:1; 11:1); all the world except Israel (<reflink target="XXX">2 Chr. 13:9</reflink>). In the New Testament "the earth" denotes the land of Judea (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 23:35</reflink>); also things carnal in contrast with things heavenly (<reflink target="XXX">John 3:31; Col. 3:1, 2</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Earthquake">
    <description>mentioned among the extraordinary phenomena of Palestine (<reflink target="XXX">Ps. 18:7; comp. Hab. 3:6; Nah. 1:5; Isa. 5:25</reflink>).</description>
    <description>The first earthquake in Palestine of which we have any record happened in the reign of Ahab (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 19:11, 12</reflink>). Another took place in the days of Uzziah, King of Judah (<reflink target="XXX">Zech. 14:5</reflink>). The most memorable earthquake taking place in New Testament times happened at the crucifixion of our Lord (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 27:54</reflink>). An earthquake at Philippi shook the prison in which Paul and Silas were imprisoned (<reflink target="XXX">Act 16:26</reflink>).</description>
    <description>It is used figuratively as a token of the presence of the Lord (<reflink target="XXX">Judg. 5:4; 2 Sam. 22:8; Ps. 77:18; 97:4; 104:32</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="East">
    <description>(1.) The orient (mizrah); the rising of the sun. Thus "the east country" is the country lying to the east of Syria, the Elymais (<reflink target="XXX">Zech. 8:7</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(2). Properly what is in front of one, or a country that is before or in front of another; the rendering of the word _kedem_. In pointing out the quarters, a Hebrew always looked with his face toward the east. The word _kedem_ is used when the four quarters of the world are described (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 13:14; 28:14</reflink>); and _mizrah_ when the east only is distinguished from the west (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 11:3; Ps. 50:1; 103:12, etc.</reflink>). In Gen. 25:6 "eastward" is literally "unto the land of kedem;" i.e., the lands lying east of Palestine, namely, Arabia, Mesopotamia, etc.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="East gate">
    <description>(<reflink target="XXX">Jer. 19:2</reflink>), properly the Potter's gate, the gate which led to the potter's field, in the valley of Hinnom.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="East sea">
    <description>(<reflink target="XXX">Joel 2:20; Ezek. 47:18</reflink>), the Dead Sea, which lay on the east side of the Holy Land. The Mediterranean, which lay on the west, was hence called the "great sea for the west border" (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 34:6</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="East wind">
    <description>the wind coming from the east (<reflink target="XXX">Job 27:21; Isa. 27:8, etc.</reflink>). Blight caused by this wind, "thin ears" (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 41:6</reflink>); the withered "gourd" (<reflink target="XXX">Jonah 4: 8</reflink>). It was the cause and also the emblem of evil (<reflink target="XXX">Ezek. 17:10; 19:12; Hos. 13:15</reflink>). In Palestine this wind blows from a burning desert, and hence is destitute of moisture necessary for vegetation.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="East, Children of the">
    <description>the Arabs as a whole, known as the Nabateans or Kedarenes, nomad tribes (<reflink target="XXX">Judg. 6:3,33; 7:12; 8:10</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Easter">
    <description>originally a Saxon word (Eostre), denoting a goddess of the Saxons, in honour of whom sacrifices were offered about the time of the Passover. Hence the name came to be given to the festival of the Resurrection of Christ, which occured at the time of the Passover. In the early English versions this word was frequently used as the translation of the Greek pascha (the Passover). When the Authorized Version (1611) was formed, the word "passover" was used in all passages in which this word pascha occurred, except in Act 12:4. In the Revised Version the proper word, "passover," is always used.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Eating">
    <description>The ancient Hebrews would not eat with the Egyptians (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 43:32</reflink>). In the time of our Lord they would not eat with Samaritans (<reflink target="XXX">John 4:9</reflink>), and were astonished that he ate with publicans and sinners (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 9:11</reflink>). The Hebrews originally sat at table, but afterwards adopted the Persian and Chaldean practice of reclining (<reflink target="XXX">Luke 7:36-50</reflink>). Their principal meal was at noon (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 43:16; 1 Kings 20:16; Ruth 2:14; Luke 14:12</reflink>). The word "eat" is used metaphorically in Jer. 15:16; Ezek. 3:1; Rev. 10:9. In John 6:53-58, "eating and drinking" means believing in Christ. Women were never present as guests at meals (q.v.).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Ebal">
    <description>stony. (1.) A mountain 3,076 feet above the level of the sea, and 1,200 feet above the level of the valley, on the north side of which stood the city of Shechem (q.v.). On this mountain six of the tribes (<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 27:12,13</reflink>) were appointed to take their stand and respond according to a prescribed form to the imprecations uttered in the valley, where the law was read by the Levites (11:29; 29:4, 13). This mountain was also the site of the first great altar erected to Jehovah (<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 27:5-8; Josh. 8:30-35</reflink>). After this the name of Ebal does not again occur in Jewish history. (<see target="x-self">See GERIZIM.</see>)</description>
    <description>(2.) A descendant of Eber (<reflink target="XXX">1 Chr. 1:22</reflink>), called also Obal (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 10:28</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(3.) A descendant of Seir the Horite (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 36:23</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Ebed">
    <description>slave, the father of Gaal, in whom the men of Shechem "put confidence" in their conspiracy against Abimelech (<reflink target="XXX">Judg. 9:26, 26, 30, 31</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Ebed-melech">
    <description>a servant of the king; probably an official title, an Ethiopian, "one of the eunuchs which was in the king's house;" i.e., in the palace of Zedekiah, king of Judah. He interceded with the king in Jeremiah's behalf, and was the means of saving him from death by famine (<reflink target="XXX">Jer. 38:7-13: comp. 39:15-18</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Eben-ezer">
    <description>stone of help, the memorial stone set up by Samuel to commemorate the divine assistance to Israel in their great battle against the Philistines, whom they totally routed (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 7:7-12</reflink>) at Aphek, in the neighbourhood of Mizpeh, in Benjamin, near the western entrance of the pass of Beth-horon. On this very battle-field, twenty years before, the Philistines routed the Israelites, "and slew of the army in the field about four thousand men" (4:1,2; here, and at 5:1, called "Eben-ezer" by anticipation). In this extremity the Israelites fetched the ark out of Shiloh and carried it into their camp. The Philistines a second time immediately attacked them, and smote them with a very great slaughter, "for there fell of Israel thirty thousand footmen. And the ark of God was taken" (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 4:10</reflink>). And now in the same place the Philistines are vanquished, and the memorial stone is erected by Samuel (q.v.). The spot where the stone was erected was somewhere "between Mizpeh and Shen." Some have identified it with the modern Beit Iksa, a conspicuous and prominent position, apparently answering all the necessary conditions; others with Dier Aban, 3 miles east of 'Ain Shems.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Eber">
    <description>beyond. (1.). The third post-duluvian patriach after Shem (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 10:24; 11:14</reflink>). He is regarded as the founder of the Hebrew race (10:21; Num. 24:24). In Luke 3:35 he is called Heber.</description>
    <description>(2.) One of the seven heads of the families of the Gadites (<reflink target="XXX">1 Chr. 5:13</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(3.) The oldest of the three sons of Elpaal the Benjamite (8:12).</description>
    <description>(4.) One of the heads of the familes of Benjamites in Jerusalem (22).</description>

  <item id="Ebony">
    <description>a black, hard wood, brought by the merchants from India to Tyre (<reflink target="XXX">Ezek. 27:15</reflink>). It is the heart-wood, brought by Diospyros ebenus, which grows in Ceylon and Southern India.</description>

  <item id="Ecclesiastes">
    <description>the Greek rendering of the Hebrew _Koheleth_, which means "Preacher." The old and traditional view of the authorship of this book attributes it to Solomon. This view can be satisfactorily maintained, though others date it from the Captivity. The writer represents himself implicitly as Solomon (1:12). It has been appropriately styled The Confession of King Solomon. "The writer is a man who has sinned in giving way to selfishness and sensuality, who has paid the penalty of that sin in satiety and weariness of life, but who has through all this been under the discipline of a divine education, and has learned from it the lesson which God meant to teach him." "The writer concludes by pointing out that the secret of a true life is that a man should consecrate the vigour of his youth to God." The key-note of the book is sounded in ch. 1:2,</description>
    <description>"Vanity of vanities! saith the Preacher, Vanity of vanities! all is vanity!"</description>
    <description>i.e., all man's efforts to find happiness apart from God are without result.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Eclipse">
    <description>of the sun alluded to in Amos 8:9; Micah 3:6; Zech. 14:6; Joel 2:10. Eclipses were regarded as tokens of God's anger (<reflink target="XXX">Joel 3:15; Job 9:7</reflink>). The darkness at the crucifixion has been ascribed to an eclipse (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 27:45</reflink>); but on the other hand it is argued that the great intensity of darkness caused by an eclipse never lasts for more than six minutes, and this darkness lasted for three hours. Moreover, at the time of the Passover the moon was full, and therefore there could not be an eclipse of the sun, which is caused by an interposition of the moon between the sun and the earth.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Ed">
    <description>witness, a word not found in the original Hebrew, nor in the LXX. and Vulgate, but added by the translators in the Authorized Version, also in the Revised Version, of Josh. 22:34. The words are literally rendered: "And the children of Reuben and the children of Gad named the altar. It is a witness between us that Jehovah is God." This great altar stood probably on the east side of the Jordan, in the land of Gilead, "over against the land of Canaan." After the division of the Promised Land, the tribes of Reuben and Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh, on returning to their own settlements on the east of Jordan (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 22:1-6</reflink>), erected a great altar, which they affirmed, in answer to the challenge of the other tribes, was not for sacrifice, but only as a witness ('Ed) or testimony to future generations that they still retained the same interest in the nation as the other tribes.</description>
  </item>

  <item id="Eden">
    <description>delight. (1.) The garden in which our first parents dewlt (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 2:8-17</reflink>). No geographical question has been so much discussed as that bearing on its site. It has been placed in Armenia, in the region west of the Caspian Sea, in Media, near Damascus, in Palestine, in Southern Arabia, and in Babylonia. The site must undoubtedly be sought for somewhere along the course of the great streams the Tigris and the Euphrates of Western Asia, in "the land of Shinar" or Babylonia. The region from about lat. 33 degrees 30' to lat. 31 degrees, which is a very rich and fertile tract, has been by the most competent authorities agreed on as the probable site of Eden. "It is a region where streams abound, where they divide and re-unite, where alone in the Mesopotamian tract can be found the phenomenon of a single river parting into four arms, each of which is or has been a river of consequence."</description>
    <description>Among almost all nations there are traditions of the primitive innocence of our race in the garden of Eden. This was the "golden age" to which the Greeks looked back. Men then lived a "life free from care, and without labour and sorrow. Old age was unknown; the body never lost its vigour; existence was a perpetual feast without a taint of evil. The earth brought forth spontaneously all things that were good in profuse abundance."</description>

    <description>(1.) The name of Esau (q.v.), Gen. 25:30, "Feed me, I pray thee, with that same red pottage [Heb. haadom, haadom, i.e., 'the red pottage, the red pottage'] ...Therefore was his name called Edom", i.e., Red.</description>
    <description>(2.) Idumea (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 34:5, 6; Ezek. 35:15</reflink>). "The field of Edom" (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 32:3</reflink>), "the land of Edom" (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 36:16</reflink>), was mountainous (<reflink target="XXX">Obad. 1:8, 9, 19, 21</reflink>). It was called the land, or "the mountain of Seir," the rough hills on the east side of the Arabah. It extended from the head of the Gulf of Akabah, the Elanitic gulf, to the foot of the Dead Sea (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 9:26</reflink>), and contained, among other cities, the rock-hewn Sela (q.v.), generally known by the Greek name Petra (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 14:7</reflink>). It is a wild and rugged region, traversed by fruitful valleys. Its old capital was Bozrah (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 63:1</reflink>). The early inhabitants of the land were Horites. They were destroyed by the Edomites (<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 2:12</reflink>), between whom and the kings of Israel and Judah there was frequent war (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 8:20; 2 Chr. 28:17</reflink>).</description>
    <description>At the time of the Exodus they churlishly refused permission to the Israelites to pass through their land (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 20:14-21</reflink>), and ever afterwards maintained an attitude of hostility toward them. They were conquered by David (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 8:14; comp. 1 Kings 9:26</reflink>), and afterwards by Amaziah (<reflink target="XXX">2 Chr. 25:11, 12</reflink>). But they regained again their independence, and in later years, during the decline of the Jewish kingdom (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 16:6; R.V. marg., "Edomites"</reflink>), made war against Israel. They took part with the Chaldeans when Nebuchadnezzar captured Jerusalem, and afterwards they invaded and held possession of the south of Palestine as far as Hebron. At length, however, Edom fell under the growing Chaldean power (<reflink target="XXX">Jer. 27:3, 6</reflink>).</description>
    <description>There are many prophecies concerning Edom (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 34:5, 6; Jer. 49:7-18; Ezek. 25:13; 35:1-15; Joel 3:19; Amos 1:11; Obad.; Mal. 1:3, 4</reflink>) which have been remarkably fulfilled. The present desolate condition of that land is a standing testimony to the inspiration of these prophecies. After an existence as a people for above seventeen hundred years, they have utterly disappeared, and their language even is forgotten for ever. In Petra, "where kings kept their court, and where nobles assembled, there no man dwells; it is given by lot to birds, and beasts, and reptiles."</description>
    <description>The Edomites were Semites, closely related in blood and in language to the Israelites. They dispossessed the Horites of Mount Seir; though it is clear, from Gen. 36, that they afterwards intermarried with the conquered population. Edomite tribes settled also in the south of Judah, like the Kenizzites (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 36:11</reflink>), to whom Caleb and Othniel belonged (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 15:17</reflink>). The southern part of Edom was known as Teman.</description>

  <item id="Edrei">
    <description>mighty; strength. (1.) One of the chief towns of the kingdom of Bashan (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 12:4, 5</reflink>). Here Og was defeated by the Israelites, and the strength of the Amorites broken (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 21:33-35</reflink>). It subsequently belonged to Manasseh, for a short time apparently, and afterwards became the abode of banditti and outlaws (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 13:31</reflink>). It has been identified with the modern Edr'a, which stands on a rocky promontory on the south-west edge of the Lejah (the Argob of the Hebrews, and Trachonitis of the Greeks). The ruins of Edr'a are the most extensive in the Hauran. They are 3 miles in circumference. A number of the ancient houses still remain; the walls, roofs, and doors being all of stone. The wild region of which Edrei was the capital is thus described in its modern aspect: "Elevated about 20 feet above the plain, it is a labyrinth of clefts and crevasses in the rock, formed by volcanic action; and owing to its impenetrable condition, it has become a refuge for outlaws and turbulent characters, who make it a sort of Cave of Adullam...It is, in fact, an impregnable natural fortress, about 20 miles in length and 15 in breadth" (Porter's Syria, etc.). Beneath this wonderful city there is also a subterranean city, hollowed out probably as a refuge for the population of the upper city in times of danger. (See BASHAN</description>

  <item id="Egg">
    <description>(Heb. beytsah, "whiteness"). Eggs deserted (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 10:14</reflink>), of a bird (<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 22:6</reflink>), an ostrich (<reflink target="XXX">Job 39:14</reflink>), the cockatrice (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 59:5</reflink>). In Luke 11:12, an egg is contrasted with a scorpion, which is said to be very like an egg in its appearance, so much so as to be with difficulty at times distinguished from it. In Job 6:6 ("the white of an egg") the word for egg (hallamuth') occurs nowhere else. It has been translated "purslain" (R.V. marg.), and the whole phrase "purslain-broth", i.e., broth made of that herb, proverbial for its insipidity; and hence an insipid discourse. Job applies this expression to the speech of Eliphaz as being insipid and dull. But the common rendering, "the white of an egg", may be satisfactorily maintained.</description>

Having entered into an alliance with Ammon and Amalek, he overran the trans-Jordanic region, and then crossing the Jordan, seized on Jericho, the "city of palm trees," which had been by this time rebuilt, but not as a fortress. He made this city his capital, and kept Israel in subjection for eighteen years. The people at length "cried unto the Lord" in their distress, and he "raised them up a deliverer" in Ehud (q.v.), the son of Gera, a Benjamite.</description>
    <description>(2.) A city in Judah, near Lachish (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 15:39</reflink>). It was destroyed by Joshua (10:5, 6). It has been identified with Tell Nejileh, 6 miles south of Tell Hesy or Ajlan, north-west of Lachish. (<see target="x-self">See LACHISH.</see>)</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Egypt">
    <description>the land of the Nile and the pyramids, the oldest kingdom of which we have any record, holds a place of great significance in Scripture.</description>
    <description>The Egyptians belonged to the white race, and their original home is still a matter of dispute. Many scholars believe that it was in Southern Arabia, and recent excavations have shown that the valley of the Nile was originally inhabited by a low-class population, perhaps belonging to the Nigritian stock, before the Egyptians of history entered it. The ancient Egyptian language, of which the latest form is Coptic, is distantly connected with the Semitic family of speech.</description>
    <description>Egypt consists geographically of two halves, the northern being the Delta, and the southern Upper Egypt, between Cairo and the First Cataract. In the Old Testament, Northern or Lower Egypt is called Mazor, "the fortified land" (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 19:6; 37: 25, where the A.V. mistranslates "defence" and "besieged places"</reflink>); while Southern or Upper Egypt is Pathros, the Egyptian Pa-to-Res, or "the land of the south" (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 11:11</reflink>). But the whole country is generally mentioned under the dual name of Mizraim, "the two Mazors."</description>
    <description>The civilization of Egypt goes back to a very remote antiquity. The two kingdoms of the north and south were united by Menes, the founder of the first historical dynasty of kings. The first six dynasties constitute what is known as the Old Empire, which had its capital at Memphis, south of Cairo, called in the Old Testament Moph (<reflink target="XXX">Hos. 9:6</reflink>) and Noph. The native name was Mennofer, "the good place."</description>
    <description>The Pyramids were tombs of the monarchs of the Old Empire, those of Gizeh being erected in the time of the Fourth Dynasty. After the fall of the Old Empire came a period of decline and obscurity. This was followed by the Middle Empire, the most powerful dynasty of which was the Twelfth. The Fayyum was rescued for agriculture by the kings of the Twelfth Dynasty; and two obelisks were erected in front of the temple of the sun-god at On or Heliopolis (near Cairo), one of which is still standing. The capital of the Middle Empire was Thebes, in Upper Egypt.</description>
    <description>The Middle Empire was overthrown by the invasion of the Hyksos, or shepherd princes from Asia, who ruled over Egypt, more especially in the north, for several centuries, and of whom there were three dynasties of kings. They had their capital at Zoan or Tanis (now San), in the north-eastern part of the Delta. It was in the time of the Hyksos that Abraham, Jacob, and Joseph entered Egypt. The Hyksos were finally expelled about B.C. 1600, by the hereditary princes of Thebes, who founded the Eighteenth Dynasty, and carried the war into Asia. Canaan and Syria were subdued, as well as Cyprus, and the boundaries of the Egyptian Empire were fixed at the Euphrates. The Soudan, which had been conquered by the kings of the Twelfth Dynasty, was again annexed to Egypt, and the eldest son of the Pharaoh took the title of "Prince of Cush."</description>
    <description>One of the later kings of the dynasty, Amenophis IV., or Khu-n-Aten, endeavoured to supplant the ancient state religion of Egypt by a new faith derived from Asia, which was a sort of pantheistic monotheism, the one supreme god being adored under the image of the solar disk. The attempt led to religious and civil war, and the Pharaoh retreated from Thebes to Central Egypt, where he built a new capital, on the site of the present Tell-el-Amarna. The cuneiform tablets that have been found there represent his foreign correspondence (about B.C. 1400). He surrounded himself with officials and courtiers of Asiatic, and more especially Canaanitish, extraction; but the native party succeeded eventually in overthrowing the government, the capital of Khu-n-Aten was destroyed, and the foreigners were driven out of the country, those that remained being reduced to serfdom.</description>
    <description>The national triumph was marked by the rise of the Nineteenth Dynasty, in the founder of which, Rameses I., we must see the "new king, who knew not Joseph." His grandson, Rameses II., reigned sixty-seven years (B.C. 1348-1281), and was an indefatigable builder. As Pithom, excavated by Dr. Naville in 1883, was one of the cities he built, he must have been the Pharaoh of the Oppression. The Pharaoh of the Exodus may have been one of his immediate successors, whose reigns were short. Under them Egypt lost its empire in Asia, and was itself attacked by barbarians from Libya and the north.</description>
    <description>The Nineteenth Dynasty soon afterwards came to an end; Egypt was distracted by civil war; and for a short time a Canaanite, Arisu, ruled over it.</description>
    <description>Then came the Twentieth Dynasty, the second Pharaoh of which, Rameses III., restored the power of his country. In one of his campaigns he overran the southern part of Palestine, where the Israelites had not yet settled. They must at the time have been still in the wilderness. But it was during the reign of Rameses III. that Egypt finally lost Gaza and the adjoining cities, which were seized by the Pulista, or Philistines.</description>
    <description>After Rameses III., Egypt fell into decay. Solomon married the daughter of one of the last kings of the Twenty-first Dynasty, which was overthrown by Shishak I., the general of the Libyan mercenaries, who founded the Twenty-second Dynasty (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 11:40; 14:25, 26</reflink>). A list of the places he captured in Palestine is engraved on the outside of the south wall of the temple of Karnak.</description>
    <description>In the time of Hezekiah, Egypt was conquered by Ethiopians from the Soudan, who constituted the Twenty-fifth Dynasty. The third of them was Tirhakah (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 19:9</reflink>). In B.C. 674 it was conquered by the Assyrians, who divided it into twenty satrapies, and Tirhakah was driven back to his ancestral dominions. Fourteen years later it successfully revolted under Psammetichus I. of Sais, the founder of the Twenty-sixth Dynasty. Among his successors were Necho (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 23:29</reflink>) and Hophra, or Apries (<reflink target="XXX">Jer. 37:5, 7, 11</reflink>). The dynasty came to an end in B.C. 525, when the country was subjugated by Cambyses. Soon afterwards it was organized into a Persian satrapy.</description>
    <description>The title of Pharaoh, given to the Egyptian kings, is the Egyptian Per-aa, or "Great House," which may be compared to that of "Sublime Porte." It is found in very early Egyptian texts.</description>
    <description>The Egyptian religion was a strange mixture of pantheism and animal worship, the gods being adored in the form of animals. While the educated classes resolved their manifold deities into manifestations of one omnipresent and omnipotent divine power, the lower classes regarded the animals as incarnations of the gods.</description>
    <description>Under the Old Empire, Ptah, the Creator, the god of Memphis, was at the head of the Pantheon; afterwards Amon, the god of Thebes, took his place. Amon, like most of the other gods, was identified with Ra, the sun-god of Heliopolis.</description>
    <description>The Egyptians believed in a resurrection and future life, as well as in a state of rewards and punishments dependent on our conduct in this world. The judge of the dead was Osiris, who had been slain by Set, the representative of evil, and afterwards restored to life. His death was avenged by his son Horus, whom the Egyptians invoked as their "Redeemer." Osiris and Horus, along with Isis, formed a trinity, who were regarded as representing the sun-god under different forms.</description>
    <description>Even in the time of Abraham, Egypt was a flourishing and settled monarchy. Its oldest capital, within the historic period, was Memphis, the ruins of which may still be seen near the Pyramids and the Sphinx. When the Old Empire of Menes came to an end, the seat of empire was shifted to Thebes, some 300 miles farther up the Nile. A short time after that, the Delta was conquered by the Hyksos, or shepherd kings, who fixed their capital at Zoan, the Greek Tanis, now San, on the Tanic arm of the Nile. All this occurred before the time of the new king "which knew not Joseph" (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 1:8</reflink>). In later times Egypt was conquered by the Persians (B.C. 525), and by the Greeks under Alexander the Great (B.C. 332), after whom the Ptolemies ruled the country for three centuries. Subsequently it was for a time a province of the Roman Empire; and at last, in A.D. 1517, it fell into the hands of the Turks, of whose empire it still forms nominally a part. Abraham and Sarah went to Egypt in the time of the shepherd kings. The exile of Joseph and the migration of Jacob to "the land of Goshen" occurred about 200 years later. On the death of Solomon, Shishak, king of Egypt, invaded Palestine (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 14:25</reflink>). He left a list of the cities he conquered.</description>
    <description>A number of remarkable clay tablets, discovered at Tell-el-Amarna in Upper Egypt, are the most important historical records ever found in connection with the Bible. They most fully confirm the historical statements of the Book of Joshua, and prove the antiquity of civilization in Syria and Palestine. As the clay in different parts of Palestine differs, it has been found possible by the clay alone to decide where the tablets come from when the name of the writer is lost. The inscriptions are cuneiform, and in the Aramaic language, resembling Assyrian. The writers are Phoenicians, Amorites, and Philistines, but in no instance Hittites, though Hittites are mentioned. The tablets consist of official dispatches and letters, dating from B.C. 1480, addressed to the two Pharaohs, Amenophis III. and IV., the last of this dynasty, from the kings and governors of Phoenicia and Palestine. There occur the names of three kings killed by Joshua, Adoni-zedec, king of Jerusalem, Japhia, king of Lachish (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 10:3</reflink>), and Jabin, king of Hazor (11:1); also the Hebrews (Abiri) are said to have come from the desert.</description>
    <description>The principal prophecies of Scripture regarding Egypt are these, Isa. 19; Jer. 43: 8-13; 44:30; 46; Ezek. 29-32; and it might be easily shown that they have all been remarkably fulfilled. For example, the singular disappearance of Noph (i.e., Memphis) is a fulfilment of Jer. 46:19, Ezek. 30:13.</description>

After the death of Othniel the people again fell into idolatry, and Eglon, the king of Moab, uniting his bands with those of the Ammonites and the Amalekites, crossed the Jordan and took the city of Jericho, and for eighteen years held that whole district in subjection, exacting from it an annual tribute. At length Ehud, by a stratagem, put Eglon to death with a two-edged dagger a cubit long, and routed the Moabites at the fords of the Jordan, putting 10,000 of them to death. Thenceforward the land, at least Benjamin, enjoyed rest "for fourscore years" (<reflink target="XXX">Judg. 3:12-30</reflink>). (<see target="x-self">See QUARRIES [2].</see>) But in the south-west the Philistines reduced the Israelites to great straits (<reflink target="XXX">Judg. 5:6</reflink>).

It was the last place to which the Philistines carried the ark before they sent it back to Israel (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 5:10; 6:1-8</reflink>).

The name Elam is an Assyrian word meaning "high."</description>
    <description>"The inhabitants of Elam, or 'the Highlands,' to the east of Babylon, were called Elamites. They were divided into several branches, speaking different dialects of the same agglutinative language. The race to which they belonged was brachycephalic, or short-headed, like the pre-Semitic Sumerians of Babylonia.</description>
    <description>"The earliest Elamite kingdom seems to have been that of Anzan, the exact site of which is uncertain; but in the time of Abraham, Shushan or Susa appears to have already become the capital of the country. Babylonia was frequently invaded by the Elamite kings, who at times asserted their supremacy over it (as in the case of Chedorlaomer, the Kudur-Lagamar, or 'servant of the goddess Lagamar,' of the cuneiform texts).</description>

Moses opened his commission to them (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 3:16</reflink>). They attended Moses on all important occasions. Seventy of them attended on him at the giving of the law (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 24:1</reflink>). Seventy also were selected from the whole number to bear with Moses the burden of the people (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 11:16, 17</reflink>). The "elder" is the keystone of the social and political fabric wherever the patriarchal system exists. At the present day this is the case among the Arabs, where the sheik (i.e., "the old man") is the highest authority in the tribe. The body of the "elders" of Israel were the representatives of the people from the very first, and were recognized as such by Moses. All down through the history of the Jews we find mention made of the elders as exercising authority among the people. They appear as governors (<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 31:28</reflink>), as local magistrates (16:18), administering justice (19:12). They were men of extensive influence (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 30:26-31</reflink>). In New Testament times they also appear taking an active part in public affairs (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 16:21; 21:23; 26:59</reflink>).</description>
    <description>The Jewish eldership was transferred from the old dispensation to the new. "The creation of the office of elder is nowhere recorded in the New Testament, as in the case of deacons and apostles, because the latter offices were created to meet new and special emergencies, while the former was transmitted from the earlies times. In other words, the office of elder was the only permanent essential office of the church under either dispensation."</description>
    <description>The "elders" of the New Testament church were the "pastors" (<reflink target="XXX">Eph. 4:11</reflink>), "bishops or overseers" (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 20:28</reflink>), "leaders" and "rulers" (<reflink target="XXX">Heb. 13:7; 1 Thess. 5:12</reflink>) of the flock. Everywhere in the New Testament bishop and presbyter are titles given to one and the same officer of the Christian church. He who is called presbyter or elder on account of his age or gravity is also called bishop or overseer with reference to the duty that lay upon him (<reflink target="XXX">Titus 1:5-7; Acts 20:17-28; Phil. 1:1</reflink>).</description>

    <description>God has ascended, a place in the pastoral country east of Jordan, in the tribe of Reuben (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 32:3, 37</reflink>).

  <item id="Eleazar">
    <description>God has helped. (1.) The third son of Aaron (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 6:23</reflink>). His wife, a daughter of Putiel, bore him Phinehas (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 6:25</reflink>). After the death of Nadab and Abihu (<reflink target="XXX">Lev. 10:12; Num. 3:4</reflink>) he was appointed to the charge of the sanctuary (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 3:32</reflink>). On Mount Hor he was clothed with the sacred vestments, which Moses took from off his brother Aaron and put upon him as successor to his father in the high priest's office, which he held for more than twenty years (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 20:25-29</reflink>). He took part with Moses in numbering the people (26:3, 4), and assisted at the inauguration of Joshua. He assisted in the distribution of the land after the conquest (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 14:1</reflink>). The high-priesthood remained in his family till the time of Eli, into whose family it passed, till it was restored to the family of Eleazar in the person of Zadok (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 2:35; comp. 1 Kings 2:27</reflink>). "And Eleazar the son of Aaron died; and they buried him in a hill that pertained to Phinehas his son" (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 24:33</reflink>). The word here rendered "hill" is Gibeah, the name of several towns in Palestine which were generally on or near a hill. The words may be more suitably rendered, "They buried him in Gibeah of Phinehas", i.e., in the city of Phinehas, which has been identified, in accordance with Jewish and Samaritan traditions, with Kefr Ghuweirah='Awertah, about 7 miles north of Shiloh, and a few miles south-east of Nablus. "His tomb is still shown there, overshadowed by venerable terebinths." Others, however, have identified it with the village of Gaba or Gebena of Eusebius, the modern Khurbet Jibia, 5 miles north of Guphna towards Nablus.</description>
    <description>(2.) An inhabitant of Kirjath-jearim who was "sanctified" to take charge of the ark, although not allowed to touch it, while it remained in the house of his father Abinadab (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 7:1, 2; comp. Num. 3:31; 4:15</reflink>).</description>

  <item id="Elect lady">

  </item>
  <item id="Election of Grace">
    <description>The Scripture speaks (1) of the election of individuals to office or to honour and privilege, e.g., Abraham, Jacob, Saul, David, Solomon, were all chosen by God for the positions they held; so also were the apostles. (2) There is also an election of nations to special privileges, e.g., the Hebrews (<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 7:6; Rom. 9:4</reflink>). (3) But in addition there is an election of individuals to eternal life (<reflink target="XXX">2 Thess. 2:13; Eph. 1:4; 1 Pet. 1:2; John 13:18</reflink>).</description>
    <description>The ground of this election to salvation is the good pleasure of God (<reflink target="XXX">Eph. 1:5, 11; Matt. 11:25, 26; John 15:16, 19</reflink>). God claims the right so to do (<reflink target="XXX">Rom. 9:16, 21</reflink>).</description>
    <description>It is not conditioned on faith or repentance, but is of soverign grace (<reflink target="XXX">Rom. 11:4-6; Eph. 1:3-6</reflink>). All that pertain to salvation, the means (<reflink target="XXX">Eph. 2:8; 2 Thess. 2:13</reflink>) as well as the end, are of God (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 5:31; 2 Tim. 2:25; 1 Cor. 1:30; Eph. 2:5, 10</reflink>). Faith and repentance and all other graces are the exercises of a regenerated soul; and regeneration is God's work, a "new creature."</description>
    <description>Men are elected "to salvation," "to the adoption of sons," "to be holy and without blame before him in love" (<reflink target="XXX">2 Thess. 2:13; Gal. 4:4, 5; Eph. 1:4</reflink>). The ultimate end of election is the praise of God's grace (<reflink target="XXX">Eph. 1:6, 12</reflink>). (See PREDESTINATION</description>

  <item id="Elements">
    <description>In its primary sense, as denoting the first principles or constituents of things, it is used in 2 Pet. 3:10: "The elements shall be dissolved." In a secondary sense it denotes the first principles of any art or science. In this sense it is used in Gal. 4:3, 9; Col. 2:8, 20, where the expressions, "elements of the world," "week and beggarly elements," denote that state of religious knowledge existing among the Jews before the coming of Christ, the rudiments of religious teaching. They are "of the world," because they are made up of types which appeal to the senses. They are "weak," because insufficient; and "beggarly," or "poor," because they are dry and barren, not being accompanied by an outpouring of spiritual gifts and graces, as the gospel is.</description>

  <item id="Elhanan">
    <description>whom God has graciously bestowed. (1.) A warrior of the time of David famed for his exploits. In the Authorized Version (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 21:19</reflink>) it is recorded that "Elhanan the son of Jaare-oregim, a Bethlehemite, slew the brother of Goliath." The Revised Version here rightly omits the words "the brother of." They were introduced in the Authorized Version to bring this passage into agreement with 1 Chr. 20:5, where it is said that he "slew Lahmi the brother of Goliath." Goliath the Gittite was killed by David (1 Sam. 17). The exploit of Elhanan took place late in David's reign.</description>

  <item id="Eli">
    <description>ascent, the high priest when the ark was at Shiloh (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 1:3, 9</reflink>). He was the first of the line of Ithamar, Aaron's fourth son (<reflink target="XXX">1 Chr. 24:3; comp. 2 Sam. 8:17</reflink>), who held that office. The office remained in his family till the time of Abiathar (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 2:26, 27</reflink>), whom Solomon deposed, and appointed Zadok, of the family of Eleazar, in his stead (35). He acted also as a civil judge in Israel after the death of Samson (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 4:18</reflink>), and judged Israel for forty years.</description>
    <description>His sons Hophni and Phinehas grossly misconducted themselves, to the great disgust of the people (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 2:27-36</reflink>). They were licentious reprobates. He failed to reprove them so sternly as he ought to have done, and so brought upon his house the judgment of God (2:22-33; 3:18). The Israelites proclaimed war against the Philistines, whose army was encamped at Aphek. The battle, fought a short way beyond Mizpeh, ended in the total defeat of Israel. Four thousand of them fell in "battle array". They now sought safety in having the "ark of the covenant of the Lord" among them. They fetched it from Shiloh, and Hophni and Phinehas accompanied it. This was the first time since the settlement of Israel in Canaan that the ark had been removed from the sanctuary. The Philistines put themselves again in array against Israel, and in the battle which ensued "Israel was smitten, and there was a very great slaughter." The tidings of this great disaster were speedily conveyed to Shiloh, about 20 miles distant, by a messenger, a Benjamite from the army. There Eli sat outside the gate of the sanctuary by the wayside, anxiously waiting for tidings from the battle-field. The full extent of the national calamity was speedily made known to him: "Israel is fled before the Philistines, there has also been a great slaughter among the people, thy two sons Hophni and Phinehas are dead, and the ark of God is taken" (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 4:12-18</reflink>). When the old man, whose eyes were "stiffened" (i.e., fixed, as of a blind eye unaffected by the light) with age, heard this sad story of woe, he fell backward from off his seat and died, being ninety and eight years old.

  </item>
  <item id="Elijah">
    <description>whose God is Jehovah. (1.) "The Tishbite," the "Elias" of the New Testament, is suddenly introduced to our notice in 1 Kings 17:1 as delivering a message from the Lord to Ahab. There is mention made of a town called Thisbe, south of Kadesh, but it is impossible to say whether this was the place referred to in the name given to the prophet.</description>
    <description>Having delivered his message to Ahab, he retired at the command of God to a hiding-place by the brook Cherith, beyond Jordan, where he was fed by ravens. When the brook dried up God sent him to the widow of Zarephath, a city of Zidon, from whose scanty store he was supported for the space of two years. During this period the widow's son died, and was restored to life by Elijah (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 17: 2-24</reflink>).</description>
    <description>During all these two years a famine prevailed in the land. At the close of this period of retirement and of preparation for his work (<reflink target="XXX">comp. Gal. 1:17, 18</reflink>) Elijah met Obadiah, one of Ahab's officers, whom he had sent out to seek for pasturage for the cattle, and bade him go and tell his master that Elijah was there. The king came and met Elijah, and reproached him as the troubler of Israel. It was then proposed that sacrifices should be publicly offered, for the purpose of determining whether Baal or Jehovah were the true God. This was done on Carmel, with the result that the people fell on their faces, crying, "The Lord, he is the God." Thus was accomplished the great work of Elijah's ministry. The prophets of Baal were then put to death by the order of Elijah. Not one of them escaped. Then immediately followed rain, according to the word of Elijah, and in answer to his prayer (<reflink target="XXX">James 5:18</reflink>).</description>
    <description>Jezebel, enraged at the fate that had befallen her priests of Baal, threatened to put Elijah to death (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 19:1-13</reflink>). He therefore fled in alarm to Beersheba, and thence went alone a day's journey into the wilderness, and sat down in despondency under a juniper tree. As he slept an angel touched him, and said unto him, "Arise and eat; because the journey is too great for thee." He arose and found a cake and a cruse of water. Having partaken of the provision thus miraculously supplied, he went forward on his solitary way for forty days and forty nights to Horeb, the mount of God, where he took up his abode in a cave. Here the Lord appeared unto him and said, "What dost thou here, Elijah?" In answer to his despondent words God manifests to him his glory, and then directs him to return to Damascus and anoint Hazael king over Syria, and Jehu king over Israel, and Elisha to be prophet in his room (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 19:13-21; comp. 2 Kings 8:7-15; 9:1-10</reflink>).</description>
    <description>Some six years after this he warned Ahab and Jezebel of the violent deaths they would die (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 21:19-24; 22:38</reflink>). He also, four years afterwards, warned Ahaziah (q.v.), who had succeeded his father Ahab, of his approaching death (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 1:1-16</reflink>). (<see target="x-self">See NABOTH.</see>) During these intervals he probably withdrew to some quiet retirement, no one knew where. His interview with Ahaziah's messengers on the way to Ekron, and the account of the destruction of his captains with their fifties, suggest the idea that he may have been in retirement at this time on Mount Carmel.</description>
    <description>The time now drew near when he was to be taken up into heaven (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 2:1-12</reflink>). He had a presentiment of what was awaiting him. He went down to Gilgal, where was a school of the prophets, and where his successor Elisha, whom he had anointed some years before, resided. Elisha was solemnized by the thought of his master's leaving him, and refused to be parted from him. "They two went on," and came to Bethel and Jericho, and crossed the Jordan, the waters of which were "divided hither and thither" when smitten with Elijah's mantle. Arrived at the borders of Gilead, which Elijah had left many years before, it "came to pass as they still went on and talked" they were suddenly separated by a chariot and horses of fire; and "Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven, "Elisha receiving his mantle, which fell from him as he ascended.</description>
    <description>No one of the old prophets is so frequently referred to in the New Testament. The priests and Levites said to the Baptist (<reflink target="XXX">John 1:25</reflink>), "Why baptizest thou, if thou be not that Christ, nor Elias?" Paul (<reflink target="XXX">Rom. 11:2</reflink>) refers to an incident in his history to illustrate his argument that God had not cast away his people. James (5:17) finds in him an illustration of the power of prayer. (<reflink target="XXX">See also Luke 4:25; 9:54.</reflink>) He was a type of John the Baptist in the sternness and power of his reproofs (<reflink target="XXX">Luke 9:8</reflink>). He was the Elijah that "must first come" (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 11:11, 14</reflink>), the forerunner of our Lord announced by Malachi. Even outwardly the Baptist corresponded so closely to the earlier prophet that he might be styled a second Elijah. In him we see "the same connection with a wild and wilderness country; the same long retirement in the desert; the same sudden, startling entrance on his work (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 17:1; Luke 3:2</reflink>); even the same dress, a hairy garment, and a leathern girdle about the loins (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 1:8; Matt. 3:4</reflink>)."</description>
    <description>How deep the impression was which Elijah made "on the mind of the nation may be judged from the fixed belief, which rested on the words of Malachi (4:5, 6), which many centuries after prevailed that he would again appear for the relief and restoration of the country. Each remarkable person as he arrives on the scene, be his habits and characteristics what they may, the stern John equally with his gentle Successor, is proclaimed to be Elijah (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 11:13, 14; 16:14; 17:10; Mark 9:11; 15:35; Luke 9:7, 8; John 1:21</reflink>). His appearance in glory on the mount of transfiguration does not seem to have startled the disciples. They were 'sore afraid,' but not apparently surprised."</description>
    <description>(2.) The Elijah spoken of in 2 Chr. 21:12-15 is by some supposed to be a different person from the foregoing. He lived in the time of Jehoram, to whom he sent a letter of warning (comp. 1 Chr. 28:19; Jer. 36), and acted as a prophet in Judah; while the Tishbite was a prophet of the northern kingdom. But there does not seem any necessity for concluding that the writer of this letter was some other Elijah than the Tishbite. It may be supposed either that Elijah anticipated the character of Jehoram, and so wrote the warning message, which was preserved in the schools of the prophets till Jehoram ascended the throne after the Tishbite's translation, or that the translation did not actually take place till after the accession of Jehoram to the throne (<reflink target="XXX">2 Chr. 21:12; 2 Kings 8:16</reflink>). The events of 2 Kings 2 may not be recorded in chronological order, and thus there may be room for the opinion that Elijah was still alive in the beginning of Jehoram's reign.</description>

The form of expression in Ex. 16:1 seems to imply that the people proceeded in detachments or companies from Elim, and only for the first time were assembled as a complete host when they reached the wilderness of Sin (q.v.).</description>

  <item id="Elisha">
    <description>God his salvation, the son of Shaphat of Abel-meholah, who became the attendant and disciple of Elijah (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 19:16-19</reflink>). His name first occurs in the command given to Elijah to anoint him as his successor (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 19:16</reflink>). This was the only one of the three commands then given to Elijah which he accomplished. On his way from Sinai to Damascus he found Elisha at his native place engaged in the labours of the field, ploughing with twelve yoke of oxen. He went over to him, threw over his shoulders his rough mantle, and at once adopted him as a son, and invested him with the prophetical office (<reflink target="XXX">comp. Luke 9:61, 62</reflink>). Elisha accepted the call thus given (about four years before the death of Ahab), and for some seven or eight years became the close attendant on Elijah till he was parted from him and taken up into heaven. During all these years we hear nothing of Elisha except in connection with the closing scenes of Elijah's life. After Elijah, Elisha was accepted as the leader of the sons of the prophets, and became noted in Israel. He possessed, according to his own request, "a double portion" of Elijah's spirit (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 2:9</reflink>); and for the long period of about sixty years (B.C. 892-832) held the office of "prophet in Israel" (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 5:8</reflink>).</description>
    <description>After Elijah's departure, Elisha returned to Jericho, and there healed the spring of water by casting salt into it (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 2:21</reflink>). We next find him at Bethel (2:23), where, with the sternness of his master, he cursed the youths who came out and scoffed at him as a prophet of God: "Go up, thou bald head." The judgment at once took effect, and God terribly visited the dishonour done to his prophet as dishonour done to himself. We next read of his predicting a fall of rain when the army of Jehoram was faint from thirst (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 3:9-20</reflink>); of the multiplying of the poor widow's cruse of oil (4:1-7); the miracle of restoring to life the son of the woman of Shunem (4:18-37); the multiplication of the twenty loaves of new barley into a sufficient supply for an hundred men (4:42-44); of the cure of Naaman the Syrian of his leprosy (5:1-27); of the punishment of Gehazi for his falsehood and his covetousness; of the recovery of the axe lost in the waters of the Jordan (6:1-7); of the miracle at Dothan, half-way on the road between Samaria and Jezreel; of the siege of Samaria by the king of Syria, and of the terrible sufferings of the people in connection with it, and Elisha's prophecy as to the relief that would come (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 6:24-7:2</reflink>).</description>
    <description>We then find Elisha at Damascus, to carry out the command given to his master to anoint Hazael king over Syria (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 8:7-15</reflink>); thereafter he directs one of the sons of the prophets to anoint Jehu, the son of Jehoshaphat, king of Israel, instead of Ahab. Thus the three commands given to Elijah (9:1-10) were at length carried out.</description>
    <description>We do not again read of him till we find him on his death-bed in his own house (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 13:14-19</reflink>). Joash, the grandson of Jehu, comes to mourn over his approaching departure, and utters the same words as those of Elisha when Elijah was taken away: "My father, my father! the chariot of Israel, and the horsemen thereof."</description>
    <description>Afterwards when a dead body is laid in Elisha's grave a year after his burial, no sooner does it touch the hallowed remains than the man "revived, and stood up on his feet" (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 13:20-21</reflink>).</description>

  <item id="Embalming">
    <description>the process of preserving a body by means of aromatics (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 50:2, 3, 26</reflink>). This art was practised by the Egyptians from the earliest times, and there brought to great perfection. This custom probably originated in the belief in the future reunion of the soul with the body. The process became more and more complicated, and to such perfection was it carried that bodies embalmed thousands of years ago are preserved to the present day in the numberless mummies that have been discovered in Egypt.</description>
    <description>The embalming of Jacob and Joseph was according to the Egyptian custom, which was partially followed by the Jews (<reflink target="XXX">2 Chr. 16:14</reflink>), as in the case of king Asa, and of our Lord (<reflink target="XXX">John 19:39, 40; Luke 23:56; 24:1</reflink>).

To the wilderness near this town David fled for fear of Saul (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 15:62; 1 Sam. 23:29</reflink>).

    <description>The vineyards of Engedi were celebrated in Solomon's time (<reflink target="XXX">Cant. 1:4</reflink>). It is the modern 'Ain Jidy. The "fountain" from which it derives its name rises on the mountain side about 600 feet above the sea, and in its rapid descent spreads luxuriance all around it. Along its banks the osher grows abundantly. That shrub is thus described by Porter: "The stem is stout, measuring sometimes nearly a foot in diameter, and the plant grows to the height of 15 feet or more. It has a grayish bark and long oval leaves, which when broken off discharge a milky fluid. The fruit resembles an apple, and hangs in clusters of two or three. When ripe it is of a rich yellow colour, but on being pressed it explodes like a puff-ball. It is chiefly filled with air...This is the so-called 'apple of Sodom.'"

    <description>(2.) The son of Jared, and father of Methuselah (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 5:21; Luke 3:37</reflink>). His father was one hundred and sixty-two years old when he was born. After the birth of Methuselah, Enoch "walked with God three hundred years" (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 5:22-24</reflink>), when he was translated without tasting death. His whole life on earth was three hundred and sixty-five years. He was the "seventh from Adam" (<reflink target="XXX">Jude 1:14</reflink>), as distinguished from the son of Cain, the third from Adam. He is spoken of in the catalogue of Old Testament worthies in the Epistle to the Hebrews (11:5). When he was translated, only Adam, so far as recorded, had as yet died a natural death, and Noah was not yet born. Mention is made of Enoch's prophesying only in Jude 1:14.</description>

    <description>(2.) Heb. nes, a lofty signal, as a column or high pole (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 21:8, 9</reflink>); a standard or signal or flag placed on high mountains to point out to the people a place of rendezvous on the irruption of an enemy (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 5:26; 11:12; 18:3; 62:10; Jer. 4:6, 21; Ps. 60:4</reflink>). This was an occasional signal, and not a military standard. Elevation and conspicuity are implied in the word.</description>

  <item id="Ephesians, Epistle to">
    <description>was written by Paul at Rome about the same time as that to the Colossians, which in many points it resembles.</description>
    <description>Contents of. The Epistle to the Colossians is mainly polemical, designed to refute certain theosophic errors that had crept into the church there. That to the Ephesians does not seem to have originated in any special circumstances, but is simply a letter springing from Paul's love to the church there, and indicative of his earnest desire that they should be fully instructed in the profound doctrines of the gospel. It contains (1) the salutation (1:1, 2); (2) a general description of the blessings the gospel reveals, as to their source, means by which they are attained, purpose for which they are bestowed, and their final result, with a fervent prayer for the further spiritual enrichment of the Ephesians (1:3-2:10); (3) "a record of that marked change in spiritual position which the Gentile believers now possessed, ending with an account of the writer's selection to and qualification for the apostolate of heathendom, a fact so considered as to keep them from being dispirited, and to lead him to pray for enlarged spiritual benefactions on his absent sympathizers" (2:12-3:21); (4) a chapter on unity as undisturbed by diversity of gifts (4:1-16); (5) special injunctions bearing on ordinary life (4:17-6:10); (6) the imagery of a spiritual warfare, mission of Tychicus, and valedictory blessing (6:11-24).</description>
    <description>Planting of the church at Ephesus. Paul's first and hurried visit for the space of three months to Ephesus is recorded in Acts 18:19-21. The work he began on this occasion was carried forward by Apollos (24-26) and Aquila and Priscilla. On his second visit, early in the following year, he remained at Ephesus "three years," for he found it was the key to the western provinces of Asia Minor. Here "a great door and effectual" was opened to him (<reflink target="XXX">1 Cor. 16:9</reflink>), and the church was established and strengthened by his assiduous labours there (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 20:20, 31</reflink>). From Ephesus as a centre the gospel spread abroad "almost throughout all Asia" (19:26). The word "mightily grew and prevailed" despite all the opposition and persecution he encountered.</description>
    <description>On his last journey to Jerusalem the apostle landed at Miletus, and summoning together the elders of the church from Ephesus, delivered to them his remarkable farewell charge (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 20:18-35</reflink>), expecting to see them no more.</description>
    <description>The following parallels between this epistle and the Milesian charge may be traced:</description>
    <description>(1.) Acts 20:19 = Eph. 4:2. The phrase "lowliness of mind" occurs nowhere else.</description>
    <description>(2.) Acts 20:27 = Eph. 1:11. The word "counsel," as denoting the divine plan, occurs only here and Heb. 6:17.</description>
    <description>(3.) Acts 20:32 = Eph. 3:20. The divine ability.</description>
    <description>(4.) Acts 20:32 = Eph. 2:20. The building upon the foundation.</description>
    <description>(5.) Acts 20:32 = Eph. 1:14, 18. "The inheritance of the saints."</description>
    <description>Place and date of the writing of the letter. It was evidently written from Rome during Paul's first imprisonment (3:1; 4:1; 6:20), and probably soon after his arrival there, about the year 62, four years after he had parted with the Ephesian elders at Miletus. The subscription of this epistle is correct.</description>
    <description>There seems to have been no special occasion for the writing of this letter, as already noted. Paul's object was plainly not polemical. No errors had sprung up in the church which he sought to point out and refute. The object of the apostle is "to set forth the ground, the cause, and the aim and end of the church of the faithful in Christ. He speaks to the Ephesians as a type or sample of the church universal." The church's foundations, its course, and its end, are his theme. "Everywhere the foundation of the church is the will of the Father; the course of the church is by the satisfaction of the Son; the end of the church is the life in the Holy Spirit." In the Epistle to the Romans, Paul writes from the point of view of justification by the imputed righteousness of Christ; here he writes from the point of view specially of union to the Redeemer, and hence of the oneness of the true church of Christ. "This is perhaps the profoundest book in existence." It is a book "which sounds the lowest depths of Christian doctrine, and scales the loftiest heights of Christian experience;" and the fact that the apostle evidently expected the Ephesians to understand it is an evidence of the "proficiency which Paul's converts had attained under his preaching at Ephesus."</description>
    <description>Relation between this epistle and that to the Colossians (q.v.). "The letters of the apostle are the fervent outburst of pastoral zeal and attachment, written without reserve and in unaffected simplicity; sentiments come warm from the heart, without the shaping out, pruning, and punctilious arrangement of a formal discourse. There is such a fresh and familiar transcription of feeling, so frequent an introduction of coloquial idiom, and so much of conversational frankness and vivacity, that the reader associates the image of the writer with every paragraph, and the ear seems to catch and recognize the very tones of living address." "Is it then any matter of amazement that one letter should resemble another, or that two written about the same time should have so much in common and so much that is peculiar? The close relation as to style and subject between the epistles to Colosse and Ephesus must strike every reader. Their precise relation to each other has given rise to much discussion. The great probability is that the epistle to Colosse was first written; the parallel passages in Ephesians, which amount to about forty-two in number, having the appearance of being expansions from the epistle to Colosse. Compare:</description>
    <description>Eph 1:7; Col 1:14 Eph 1:10; Col 1:20 Eph 3:2; Col 1:25 Eph 5:19; Col 3:16 Eph 6:22; Col 4:8 Eph 1:19-2:5; Col 2:12,13 Eph 4:2-4; Col 3:12-15 Eph 4:16; Col 2:19 Eph 4:32; Col 3:13 Eph 4:22-24; Col 3:9,10 Eph 5:6-8; Col 3:6-8 Eph 5:15,16; Col 4:5 Eph 6:19,20; Col 4:3,4 Eph 5:22-6:9; Col 3:18-4:1</description>
    <description>"The style of this epistle is exceedingly animated, and corresponds with the state of the apostle's mind at the time of writing.  Overjoyed with the account which their messenger had brought him of their faith and holiness (<reflink target="XXX">Eph. 1:15</reflink>), and transported with the consideration of the unsearchable wisdom of God displayed in the work of man's redemption, and of his astonishing love towards the Gentiles in making them partakers through faith of all the benefits of Christ's death, he soars high in his sentiments on those grand subjects, and gives his thoughts utterance in sublime and copious expression."</description>

  <item id="Ephesus">
    <description>the capital of proconsular Asia, which was the western part of Asia Minor. It was colonized principally from Athens. In the time of the Romans it bore the title of "the first and greatest metropolis of Asia." It was distinguished for the Temple of Diana (q.v.), who there had her chief shrine; and for its theatre, which was the largest in the world, capable of containing 50,000 spectators. It was, like all ancient theatres, open to the sky. Here were exhibited the fights of wild beasts and of men with beasts. (Comp. 1 Cor. 4:9; 9:24, 25; 15:32.)</description>
    <description>Many Jews took up their residence in this city, and here the seeds of the gospel were sown immediately after Pentecost (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 2:9; 6:9</reflink>). At the close of his second missionary journey (about A.D. 51), when Paul was returning from Greece to Syria (18:18-21), he first visited this city. He remained, however, for only a short time, as he was hastening to keep the feast, probably of Pentecost, at Jerusalem; but he left Aquila and Priscilla behind him to carry on the work of spreading the gospel.</description>
    <description>During his third missionary journey Paul reached Ephesus from the "upper coasts" (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 19:1</reflink>), i.e., from the inland parts of Asia Minor, and tarried here for about three years; and so successful and abundant were his labours that "all they which dwelt in Asia heard the word of the Lord Jesus, both Jews and Greeks" (19:10). Probably during this period the seven churches of the Apocalypse were founded, not by Paul's personal labours, but by missionaries whom he may have sent out from Ephesus, and by the influence of converts returning to their homes.</description>
    <description>On his return from his journey, Paul touched at Miletus, some 30 miles south of Ephesus (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 20:15</reflink>), and sending for the presbyters of Ephesus to meet him there, he delivered to them that touching farewell charge which is recorded in Acts 20:18-35. Ephesus is not again mentioned till near the close of Paul's life, when he writes to Timothy exhorting him to "abide still at Ephesus" (<reflink target="XXX">1 Tim. 1:3</reflink>).</description>
    <description>Two of Paul's companions, Trophimus and Tychicus, were probably natives of Ephesus (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 20:4; 21:29; 2 Tim. 4:12</reflink>). In his second epistle to Timothy, Paul speaks of Onesiphorus as having served him in many things at Ephesus (<reflink target="XXX">2 Tim. 1:18</reflink>). He also "sent Tychicus to Ephesus" (4:12), probably to attend to the interests of the church there. Ephesus is twice mentioned in the Apocalypse (1:11; 2:1).</description>
    <description>The apostle John, according to tradition, spent many years in Ephesus, where he died and was buried.</description>
    <description>A part of the site of this once famous city is now occupied by a small Turkish village, Ayasaluk, which is regarded as a corruption of the two Greek words, hagios theologos; i.e., "the holy divine."</description>

It was worn by Samuel, and also by David (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 6:14</reflink>). It was made of fine linen, and consisted of two pieces, which hung from the neck, and covered both the back and front, above the tunic and outer garment (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 28:31</reflink>). That of the high priest was embroidered with divers colours. The two pieces were joined together over the shoulders (hence in Latin called superhumerale) by clasps or buckles of gold or precious stones, and fastened round the waist by a "curious girdle of gold, blue, purple, and fine twined linen" (28:6-12).</description>

The first incident recorded regarding him is his being placed, along with his brother Manasseh, before their grandfather, Jacob, that he might bless them (48:10; comp. 27:1). The intention of Joseph was that the right hand of the aged patriarch should be placed on the head of the elder of the two; but Jacob set Ephraim the younger before his brother, "guiding his hands wittingly."

  <item id="Ephraim, Mount">
    <description>the central mountainous district of Palestine occupied by the tribe of Ephraim (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 17:15; 19:50; 20:7</reflink>), extending from Bethel to the plain of Jezreel. In Joshua's time (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 17:18</reflink>) these hills were densely wooded. They were intersected by well-watered, fertile valleys, referred to in Jer. 50:19. Joshua was buried at Timnath-heres among the mountains of Ephraim, on the north side of the hill of Gaash (<reflink target="XXX">Judg. 2:9</reflink>). This region is also called the "mountains of Israel" (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 11:21</reflink>) and the "mountains of Samaria" (<reflink target="XXX">Jer. 31:5, 6: Amos 3:9</reflink>).</description>

  <item id="Ephraim, The tribe of">
    <description>took precedence over that of Manasseh by virtue of Jacob's blessing (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 41:52; 48:1</reflink>). The descendants of Joseph formed two of the tribes of Israel, whereas each of the other sons of Jacob was the founder of only one tribe. Thus there were in reality thirteen tribes; but the number twelve was preserved by excluding that of Levi when Ephraim and Manasseh are mentioned separately (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 1:32-34; Josh. 17:14, 17; 1 Chr. 7:20</reflink>).</description>
    <description>Territory of. At the time of the first census in the wilderness this tribe numbered 40,500 (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 1:32, 33</reflink>); forty years later, when about to take possession of the Promised Land, it numbered only 32,500. During the march (<see target="x-self">see CAMP</see>) Ephraim's place was on the west side of the tabernacle (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 2:18-24</reflink>). When the spies were sent out to spy the land, "Oshea the son of Nun" of this tribe signalized himself.</description>
    <description>The boundaries of the portion of the land assigned to Ephraim are given in Josh. 16:1-10. It included most of what was afterwards called Samaria as distinguished from Judea and Galilee. It thus lay in the centre of all traffic, from north to south, and from Jordan to the sea, and was about 55 miles long and 30 broad. The tabernacle and the ark were deposited within its limits at Shiloh, where it remained for four hundred years. During the time of the judges and the first stage of the monarchy this tribe manifested a domineering and haughty and discontented spirit. "For more than five hundred years, a period equal to that which elapsed between the Norman Conquest and the War of the Roses, Ephraim, with its two dependent tribes of Manasseh and Benjamin, exercised undisputed pre-eminence. Joshua the first conqueror, Gideon the greatest of the judges, and Saul the first king, belonged to one or other of the three tribes. It was not till the close of the first period of Jewish history that God 'refused the tabernacle of Joseph, and chose not the tribe of Ephraim, but chose the tribe of Judah, the Mount Zion which he loved' (<reflink target="XXX">Ps. 78:67, 68</reflink>). When the ark was removed from Shiloh to Zion the power of Ephraim was humbled."</description>
    <description>Among the causes which operated to bring about the disruption of Israel was Ephraim's jealousy of the growing power of Judah. From the settlement of Canaan till the time of David and Solomon, Ephraim had held the place of honour among the tribes. It occupied the central and fairest portions of the land, and had Shiloh and Shechem within its borders. But now when Jerusalem became the capital of the kingdom, and the centre of power and worship for the whole nation of Israel, Ephraim declined in influence. The discontent came to a crisis by Rehoboam's refusal to grant certain redresses that were demanded (1 Kings 12).</description>

These are not arranged in the New Testament in the order of time as to their composition, but rather according to the rank of the cities or places to which they were sent. Who arranged them after this manner is unknown. Paul's letters were, as a rule, dictated to an amanuensis, a fact which accounts for some of their peculiarities. He authenticated them, however, by adding a few words in his own hand at the close. (See GALATIANS, EPISTLE TO</description>
    <description>The epistles to Timothy and Titus are styled the Pastoral Epistles.</description>
    <description>(2.) The Catholic or General Epistles, so called because they are not addressed to any particular church or city or individual, but to Christians in general, or to Christians in several countries.

    <description>It is an interesting and instructive fact that a large portion of the New Testament is taken up with epistles. The doctrines of Christianity are thus not set forth in any formal treatise, but mainly in a collection of letters. "Christianity was the first great missionary religion. It was the first to break the bonds of race and aim at embracing all mankind. But this necessarily involved a change in the mode in which it was presented. The prophet of the Old Testament, if he had anything to communicate, either appeared in person or sent messengers to speak for him by word of mouth. The narrow limits of Palestine made direct personal communication easy. But the case was different when the Christian Church came to consist of a number of scattered parts, stretching from Mesopotamia in the east to Rome or even Spain in the far west. It was only natural that the apostle by whom the greater number of these communities had been founded should seek to communicate with them by letter."</description>

It was probably the city of the Archevites, who were transplanted to Samaria by Asnapper (<reflink target="XXX">Ezra 4:9</reflink>). It lay on the left bank of the Euphrates, about 120 miles south-east of Babylon, and is now represented by the mounds and ruins of Warka. It appears to have been the necropolis of the Assyrian kings, as the whole region is strewed with bricks and the remains of coffins. "Standing on the summit of the principal edifice, called the Buwarizza, a tower 200 feet square in the centre of the ruins, the beholder is struck with astonishment at the enormous accumulation of mounds and ancient relics at his feet. An irregular circle, nearly 6 miles in circumference, is defined by the traces of an earthen rampart, in some places 40 feet high."</description>

Nothing further is recorded of him in Scripture, except that he settled certain colonists in Samaria (<reflink target="XXX">Ezra 4:2</reflink>). But from the monuments it appears that he was the most powerful of all the Assyrian monarchs. He built many temples and palaces, the most magnificent of which was the south-west palace at Nimrud, which is said to have been in its general design almost the same as Solomon's palace, only much larger (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 7:1-12</reflink>).</description>
    <description>In December B.C. 681 Sennacherib was murdered by two of his sons, who, after holding Nineveh for forty-two days, were compelled to fly to Erimenas of Ararat, or Armenia. Their brother Esarhaddon, who had been engaged in a campaign against Armenia, led his army against them. They were utterly overthrown in a battle fought April B.C. 680, near Malatiyeh, and in the following month Esarhaddon was crowned at Nineveh. He restored Babylon, conquered Egypt, and received tribute from Manasseh of Judah. He died in October B.C. 668, while on the march to suppress an Egyptian revolt, and was succeeded by his son Assur-bani-pal, whose younger brother was made viceroy of Babylonia.</description>

  <item id="Esau">
    <description>hairy, Rebekah's first-born twin son (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 25:25</reflink>). The name of Edom, "red", was also given to him from his conduct in connection with the red lentil "pottage" for which he sold his birthright (30, 31). The circumstances connected with his birth foreshadowed the enmity which afterwards subsisted between the twin brothers and the nations they founded (25:22, 23, 26). In process of time Jacob, following his natural bent, became a shepherd; while Esau, a "son of the desert," devoted himself to the perilous and toilsome life of a huntsman. On a certain occasion, on returning from the chase, urged by the cravings of hunger, Esau sold his birthright to his brother, Jacob, who thereby obtained the covenant blessing (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 27:28, 29, 36; Heb. 12:16, 17</reflink>). He afterwards tried to regain what he had so recklessly parted with, but was defeated in his attempts through the stealth of his brother (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 27:4, 34, 38</reflink>).</description>
    <description>At the age of forty years, to the great grief of his parents, he married (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 26:34, 35</reflink>) two Canaanitish maidens, Judith, the daughter of Beeri, and Bashemath, the daughter of Elon. When Jacob was sent away to Padan-aram, Esau tried to conciliate his parents (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 28:8, 9</reflink>) by marrying his cousin Mahalath, the daughter of Ishmael. This led him to cast in his lot with the Ishmaelite tribes; and driving the Horites out of Mount Seir, he settled in that region. After some thirty years' sojourn in Padan-aram Jacob returned to Canaan, and was reconciled to Esau, who went forth to meet him (33:4). Twenty years after this, Isaac their father died, when the two brothers met, probably for the last time, beside his grave (35:29). Esau now permanently left Canaan, and established himself as a powerful and wealthy chief in the land of Edom (q.v.).</description>
    <description>Long after this, when the descendants of Jacob came out of Egypt, the Edomites remembered the old quarrel between the brothers, and with fierce hatred they warred against Israel.</description>

  <item id="Esdraelon">
    <description>the Greek form of the Hebrew "Jezreel," the name of the great plain (called by the natives Merj Ibn Amer; i.e., "the meadow of the son of Amer") which stretches across Central Palestine from the Jordan to the Mediterraanean, separating the mountain ranges of Carmel and Samaria from those of Galilee, extending about 14 miles from north to south, and 9 miles from east to west. It is drained by "that ancient river" the Kishon, which flows westward to the Mediterranean. From the foot of Mount Tabor it branches out into three valleys, that on the north passing between Tabor and Little Hermon (<reflink target="XXX">Judg. 4:14</reflink>); that on the south between Mount Gilboa and En-gannim (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 9:27</reflink>); while the central portion, the "valley of Jezreel" proper, runs into the Jordan valley (which is about 1,000 feet lower than Esdraelon) by Bethshean. Here Gideon gained his great victory over the Midianites (<reflink target="XXX">Judg. 7:1-25</reflink>). Here also Barak defeated Sisera, and Saul's army was defeated by the Philistines, and king Josiah, while fighting in disguise against Necho, king of Egypt, was slain (<reflink target="XXX">2 Chr. 35:20-27; 2 Kings 23-29</reflink>). This plain has been well called the "battle-field of Palestine." "It has been a chosen place for encampment in every contest carried on in this country, from the days of Nebuchadnezzar, king of the Assyrians, in the history of whose wars with Arphaxad it is mentioned as the Great Plain of Esdraelon, until the disastrous march of Napoleon Bonaparte from Egypt into Syria. Jews, Gentiles, Saracens, Crusaders, Frenchmen, Egyptians, Persians, Druses, Turks, and Arabs, warriors out of every nation which is under heaven, have pitched their tents in the plain, and have beheld the various banners of their nations wet with the dews of Tabor and Hermon" (Dr. Clark).</description>

On their way back they explored the route which led into the south (the Negeb) by the western edge of the mountains at Telilat el-'Anab, i.e., "grape-mounds", near Beersheba. "In one of these extensive valleys, perhaps in Wady Hanein, where miles of grape-mounds even now meet the eye, they cut the gigantic clusters of grapes, and gathered the pomegranates and figs, to show how goodly was the land which the Lord had promised for their inheritance.", Palmer's Desert of the Exodus.</description>

  <item id="Esther">
    <description>the queen of Ahasuerus, and heroine of the book that bears her name. She was a Jewess named Hadas'sah (the myrtle), but when she entered the royal harem she received the name by which she henceforth became known (<reflink target="XXX">Esther 2:7</reflink>). It is a Syro-Arabian modification of the Persian word satarah, which means a star. She was the daughter of Abihail, a Benjamite. Her family did not avail themselves of the permission granted by Cyrus to the exiles to return to Jerusalem; and she resided with her cousin Mordecai, who held some office in the household of the Persian king at "Shushan in the palace." Ahasuerus having divorced Vashti, chose Esther to be his wife. Soon after this he gave Haman the Agagite, his prime minister, power and authority to kill and extirpate all the Jews throughout the Persian empire. By the interposition of Esther this terrible catastrophe was averted. Haman was hanged on the gallows he had intended for Mordecai (Esther 7); and the Jews established an annual feast, the feast of Purim (q.v.), in memory of their wonderful deliverance. This took place about fifty-two years after the Return, the year of the great battles of Plataea and Mycale (B.C. 479).</description>
    <description>Esther appears in the Bible as a "woman of deep piety, faith, courage, patriotism, and caution, combined with resolution; a dutiful daughter to her adopted father, docile and obedient to his counsels, and anxious to share the king's favour with him for the good of the Jewish people. There must have been a singular grace and charm in her aspect and manners, since 'she obtained favour in the sight of all them that looked upon her' (<reflink target="XXX">Esther 2:15</reflink>). That she was raised up as an instrument in the hand of God to avert the destruction of the Jewish people, and to afford them protection and forward their wealth and peace in their captivity, is also manifest from the Scripture account."</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Esther, Book of">
    <description>The authorship of this book is unknown. It must have been obviously written after the death of Ahasuerus (the Xerxes of the Greeks), which took place B.C. 465. The minute and particular account also given of many historical details makes it probable that the writer was contemporary with Mordecai and Esther. Hence we may conclude that the book was written probably about B.C. 444-434, and that the author was one of the Jews of the dispersion.</description>
    <description>This book is more purely historical than any other book of Scripture; and it has this remarkable peculiarity that the name of God does not occur in it from first to last in any form. It has, however, been well observed that "though the name of God be not in it, his finger is." The book wonderfully exhibits the providential government of God.</description>

It has been identified with Beit 'Atab, west of Bethlehem, near Zorah and Eshtaol.

  <item id="Eternal death">
    <description>The miserable fate of the wicked in hell (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 25:46; Mark 3:29; Heb. 6:2; 2 Thess. 1:9; Matt. 18:8; 25:41; Jude 1:7</reflink>). The Scripture as clearly teaches the unending duration of the penal sufferings of the lost as the "everlasting life," the "eternal life" of the righteous. The same Greek words in the New Testament (aion, aionios, aidios) are used to express (1) the eternal existence of God (<reflink target="XXX">1 Tim. 1:17; Rom. 1:20; 16:26</reflink>); (2) of Christ (<reflink target="XXX">Rev. 1:18</reflink>); (3) of the Holy Ghost (<reflink target="XXX">Heb. 9:14</reflink>); and (4) the eternal duration of the sufferings of the lost (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 25:46; Jude 1:6</reflink>).</description>
    <description>Their condition after casting off the mortal body is spoken of in these expressive words: "Fire that shall not be quenched" (<reflink target="XXX">Mark 9:45, 46</reflink>), "fire unquenchable" (<reflink target="XXX">Luke 3:17</reflink>), "the worm that never dies," the "bottomless pit" (<reflink target="XXX">Rev. 9:1</reflink>), "the smoke of their torment ascending up for ever and ever" (<reflink target="XXX">Rev. 14:10, 11</reflink>).</description>
    <description>The idea that the "second death" (<reflink target="XXX">Rev. 20:14</reflink>) is in the case of the wicked their absolute destruction, their annihilation, has not the slightest support from Scripture, which always represents their future as one of conscious suffering enduring for ever.</description>
    <description>The supposition that God will ultimately secure the repentance and restoration of all sinners is equally unscriptural. There is not the slightest trace in all the Scriptures of any such restoration. Sufferings of themselves have no tendency to purify the soul from sin or impart spiritual life. The atoning death of Christ and the sanctifying power of the Holy Spirit are the only means of divine appointment for bringing men to repentance. Now in the case of them that perish these means have been rejected, and "there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins" (<reflink target="XXX">Heb. 10:26, 27</reflink>).</description>

It comprises the whole future of the redeemed (<reflink target="XXX">Luke 16:9</reflink>), and is opposed to "eternal punishment" (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 19:29; 25:46</reflink>). It is the final reward and glory into which the children of God enter (<reflink target="XXX">1 Tim. 6:12, 19; Rom. 6:22; Gal. 6:8; 1 Tim. 1:16; Rom. 5:21</reflink>); their Sabbath of rest (<reflink target="XXX">Heb. 4:9; comp. 12:22</reflink>).</description>
    <description>The newness of life which the believer derives from Christ (<reflink target="XXX">Rom. 6:4</reflink>) is the very essence of salvation, and hence the life of glory or the eternal life must also be theirs (<reflink target="XXX">Rom. 6:8; 2 Tim. 2:11, 12; Rom. 5:17, 21; 8:30; Eph. 2:5, 6</reflink>). It is the "gift of God in Jesus Christ our Lord" (<reflink target="XXX">Rom. 6:23</reflink>). The life the faithful have here on earth (<reflink target="XXX">John 3:36; 5:24; 6:47, 53-58</reflink>) is inseparably connected with the eternal life beyond, the endless life of the future, the happy future of the saints in heaven (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 19:16, 29; 25:46</reflink>).</description>

It corresponds generally with what is now known as the Soudan (i.e., the land of the blacks). This country was known to the Hebrews, and is described in Isa. 18:1; Zeph. 3:10. They carried on some commercial intercourse with it (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 45:14</reflink>).</description>

  <item id="Euphrates">
    <description>Hebrew, Perath; Assyrian, Purat; Persian cuneiform, Ufratush, whence Greek Euphrates, meaning "sweet water." The Assyrian name means "the stream," or "the great stream."

    <description>The Euphrates is first mentioned in Gen. 2:14 as one of the rivers of Paradise. It is next mentioned in connection with the covenant which God entered into with Abraham (15:18), when he promised to his descendants the land from the river of Egypt to the river Euphrates (<reflink target="XXX">comp. Deut. 11:24; Josh. 1:4</reflink>), a covenant promise afterwards fulfilled in the extended conquests of David (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 8:2-14; 1 Chr. 18:3; 1 Kings 4:24</reflink>). It was then the boundary of the kingdom to the north-east. In the ancient history of Assyria, and Babylon, and Egypt many events are recorded in which mention is made of the "great river." Just as the Nile represented in prophecy the power of Egypt, so the Euphrates represented the Assyrian power (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 8:7; Jer. 2:18</reflink>).</description>
    <description>It is by far the largest and most important of all the rivers of Western Asia. From its source in the Armenian mountains to the Persian Gulf, into which it empties itself, it has a course of about 1,700 miles. It has two sources, (1) the Frat or Kara-su (i.e., "the black river"), which rises 25 miles north-east of Erzeroum; and (2) the Muradchai (i.e., "the river of desire"), which rises near Ararat, on the northern slope of Ala-tagh. At Kebban Maden, 400 miles from the source of the former, and 270 from that of the latter, they meet and form the majestic stream, which is at length joined by the Tigris at Koornah, after which it is called Shat-el-Arab, which runs in a deep and broad stream for above 140 miles to the sea. It is estimated that the alluvium brought down by these rivers encroaches on the sea at the rate of about one mile in thirty years.</description>

  <item id="Evangelist">
    <description>a "publisher of glad tidings;" a missionary preacher of the gospel (<reflink target="XXX">Eph. 4:11</reflink>). This title is applied to Philip (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 21:8</reflink>), who appears to have gone from city to city preaching the word (8:4, 40). Judging from the case of Philip, evangelists had neither the authority of an apostle, nor the gift of prophecy, nor the responsibility of pastoral supervision over a portion of the flock. They were itinerant preachers, having it as their special function to carry the gospel to places where it was previously unknown. The writers of the four Gospels are known as the Evangelists.</description>

  <item id="Eve">
    <description>life; living, the name given by Adam to his wife (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 3:20; 4:1</reflink>). The account of her creation is given in Gen. 2:21, 22. The Creator, by declaring that it was not good for man to be alone, and by creating for him a suitable companion, gave sanction to monogamy. The commentator Matthew Henry says: "This companion was taken from his side to signify that she was to be dear unto him as his own flesh. Not from his head, lest she should rule over him; nor from his feet, lest he should tyrannize over her; but from his side, to denote that species of equality which is to subsist in the marriage state." And again, "That wife that is of God's making by special grace, and of God's bringing by special providence, is likely to prove a helpmeet to her husband." Through the subtle temptation of the serpent she violated the commandment of God by taking of the forbidden fruit, which she gave also unto her husband (<reflink target="XXX">1 Tim. 2:13-15; 2 Cor. 11:3</reflink>). When she gave birth to her first son, she said, "I have gotten a man from the Lord" (R.V., "I have gotten a man with the help of the Lord," Gen. 4:1). Thus she welcomed Cain, as some think, as if he had been the Promised One the "Seed of the woman."</description>

  <item id="Evening">
    <description>the period following sunset with which the Jewish day began (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 1:5; Mark 13:35</reflink>). The Hebrews reckoned two evenings of each day, as appears from Ex. 16:12: 30:8; 12:6 (marg.); Lev. 23:5 (marg. R.V., "between the two evenings"). The "first evening" was that period when the sun was verging towards setting, and the "second evening" the moment of actual sunset. The word "evenings" in Jer. 5:6 should be "deserts" (marg.

    <description>After the destruction of Samaria (B.C. 720) by Shalmaneser and Sargon (q.v.), there was a general deportation of the Israelites into Mesopotamia and Media (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 17:6; 18:9; 1 Chr. 5:26</reflink>). (<see target="x-self">See ISRAEL, KINGDOM OF.</see>)</description>
    <description>(2.) Of the kingdom of the two tribes, the kingdom of Judah. Nebuchadnezzar, in the fourth year of Jehoiakim (<reflink target="XXX">Jer. 25:1</reflink>), invaded Judah, and carried away some royal youths, including Daniel and his companions (B.C. 606), together with the sacred vessels of the temple (<reflink target="XXX">2 Chr. 36:7; Dan. 1:2</reflink>). In B.C. 598 (<reflink target="XXX">Jer. 52:28; 2 Kings 24:12</reflink>), in the beginning of Jehoiachin's reign (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 24:8</reflink>), Nebuchadnezzar carried away captive 3,023 eminent Jews, including the king (<reflink target="XXX">2 Chr. 36:10</reflink>), with his family and officers (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 24:12</reflink>), and a large number of warriors (16), with very many persons of note (14), and artisans (16), leaving behind only those who were poor and helpless. This was the first general deportation to Babylon.</description>
    <description>In B.C. 588, after the revolt of Zedekiah (q.v.), there was a second general deportation of Jews by Nebuchadnezzar (<reflink target="XXX">Jer. 52:29; 2 Kings 25:8</reflink>), including 832 more of the principal men of the kingdom. He carried away also the rest of the sacred vessels (<reflink target="XXX">2 Chr. 36:18</reflink>). From this period, when the temple was destroyed (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 25:9</reflink>), to the complete restoration, B.C. 517 (<reflink target="XXX">Ezra 6:15</reflink>), is the period of the "seventy years."</description>
    <description>In B.C. 582 occurred the last and final deportation. The entire number Nebuchadnezzar carried captive was 4,600 heads of families with their wives and children and dependants (<reflink target="XXX">Jer. 52:30; 43:5-7; 2 Chr. 36:20, etc.</reflink>). Thus the exiles formed a very considerable community in Babylon.</description>
    <description>When Cyrus granted permission to the Jews to return to their own land (<reflink target="XXX">Ezra 1:5; 7:13</reflink>), only a comparatively small number at first availed themselves of the privilege. It cannot be questioned that many belonging to the kingdom of Israel ultimately joined the Jews under Ezra, Zerubbabel, and Nehemiah, and returned along with them to Jerusalem (<reflink target="XXX">Jer. 50:4, 5, 17-20, 33-35</reflink>).</description>
    <description>Large numbers had, however, settled in the land of Babylon, and formed numerous colonies in different parts of the kingdom. Their descendants very probably have spread far into Eastern lands and become absorbed in the general population. (<see target="x-self">See JUDAH, KINGDOM OF; CAPTIVITY.</see>)</description>

    <description>the great deliverance wrought for the children of Isreal when they were brought out of the land of Egypt with "a mighty hand and with an outstretched arm" (<reflink target="XXX">Ex 12:51; Deut. 26:8; Ps 114; 136</reflink>), about B.C. 1490, and four hundred and eighty years (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 6:1</reflink>) before the building of Solomon's temple.</description>
    <description>The time of their sojourning in Egypt was, according to Ex. 12:40, the space of four hundred and thirty years. In the LXX., the words are, "The sojourning of the children of Israel which they sojourned in Egypt and in the land of Canaan was four hundred and thirty years;" and the Samaritan version reads, "The sojourning of the children of Israel and of their fathers which they sojourned in the land of Canaan and in the land of Egypt was four hundred and thirty years." In Gen. 15:13-16, the period is prophetically given (in round numbers) as four hundred years. This passage is quoted by Stephen in his defence before the council (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 7:6</reflink>).</description>
    <description>The chronology of the "sojourning" is variously estimated. Those who adopt the longer term reckon thus:</description>
    <description>Years         From the descent of Jacob into Egypt to the          death of Joseph                              71         From the death of Joseph to the birth of          Moses                                       278         From the birth of Moses to his flight into          Midian                                       40         From the flight of Moses to his return into          Egypt                                        40         From the return of Moses to the Exodus          1                                                       430</description>
    <description>Others contend for the shorter period of two hundred and fifteen years, holding that the period of four hundred and thirty years comprehends the years from the entrance of Abraham into Canaan (<see target="x-self">see LXX. and Samaritan</see>) to the descent of Jacob into Egypt. They reckon thus:</description>
    <description>Years         From Abraham's arrival in Canaan to Isaac's          birth                                        25         From Isaac's birth to that of his twin sons          Esau and Jacob                               60         From Jacob's birth to the going down into          Egypt                                       130                                                      (215)         From Jacob's going down into Egypt to the          death of Joseph                              71         From death of Joseph to the birth of Moses     64         From birth of Moses to the Exodus              80                                             In all... 430</description>
    <description>During the forty years of Moses' sojourn in the land of Midian, the Hebrews in Egypt were being gradually prepared for the great national crisis which was approaching. The plagues that successively fell upon the land loosened the bonds by which Pharaoh held them in slavery, and at length he was eager that they should depart. But the Hebrews must now also be ready to go. They were poor; for generations they had laboured for the Egyptians without wages. They asked gifts from their neighbours around them (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 12:35</reflink>), and these were readily bestowed. And then, as the first step towards their independent national organization, they observed the feast of the Passover, which was now instituted as a perpetual memorial. The blood of the paschal lamb was duly sprinkled on the door-posts and lintels of all their houses, and they were all within, waiting the next movement in the working out of God's plan. At length the last stroke fell on the land of Egypt. "It came to pass, that at midnight Jehovah smote all the firstborn in the land of Egypt." Pharaoh rose up in the night, and called for Moses and Aaron by night, and said, "Rise up, and get you forth from among my people, both ye and the children of Israel; and go, serve Jehovah, as ye have said. Also take your flocks and your herds, as ye have said, and be gone; and bless me also." Thus was Pharaoh (q.v.) completely humbled and broken down. These words he spoke to Moses and Aaron "seem to gleam through the tears of the humbled king, as he lamented his son snatched from him by so sudden a death, and tremble with a sense of the helplessness which his proud soul at last felt when the avenging hand of God had visited even his palace."</description>
    <description>The terror-stricken Egyptians now urged the instant departure of the Hebrews. In the midst of the Passover feast, before the dawn of the 15th day of the month Abib (our April nearly), which was to be to them henceforth the beginning of the year, as it was the commencement of a new epoch in their history, every family, with all that appertained to it, was ready for the march, which instantly began under the leadership of the heads of tribes with their various sub-divisions. They moved onward, increasing as they went forward from all the districts of Goshen, over the whole of which they were scattered, to the common centre. Three or four days perhaps elapsed before the whole body of the people were assembled at Rameses, and ready to set out under their leader Moses (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 12:37; Num. 33:3</reflink>). This city was at that time the residence of the Egyptian court, and here the interviews between Moses and Pharaoh had taken place.</description>
    <description>From Rameses they journeyed to Succoth (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 12:37</reflink>), identified with Tel-el-Maskhuta, about 12 miles west of Ismailia. (<see target="x-self">See PITHOM.</see>) Their third station was Etham (q.v.), 13:20, "in the edge of the wilderness," and was probably a little to the west of the modern town of Ismailia, on the Suez Canal. Here they were commanded "to turn and encamp before Pi-hahiroth, between Migdol and the sea", i.e., to change their route from east to due south. The Lord now assumed the direction of their march in the pillar of cloud by day and of fire by night. They were then led along the west shore of the Red Sea till they came to an extensive camping-ground "before Pi-hahiroth," about 40 miles from Etham. This distance from Etham may have taken three days to traverse, for the number of camping-places by no means indicates the number of days spent on the journey: e.g., it took fully a month to travel from Rameses to the wilderness of Sin (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 16:1</reflink>), yet reference is made to only six camping-places during all that time. The exact spot of their encampment before they crossed the Red Sea cannot be determined. It was probably somewhere near the present site of Suez.</description>
    <description>Under the direction of God the children of Israel went "forward" from the camp "before Pi-hahiroth," and the sea opened a pathway for them, so that they crossed to the farther shore in safety. The Egyptian host pursued after them, and, attempting to follow through the sea, were overwhelmed in its returning waters, and thus the whole military force of the Egyptians perished. They "sank as lead in the mighty waters" (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 15:1-9; comp. Ps. 77:16-19</reflink>).</description>
    <description>Having reached the eastern shore of the sea, perhaps a little way to the north of 'Ayun Musa ("the springs of Moses"), there they encamped and rested probably for a day. Here Miriam and the other women sang the triumphal song recorded in Ex. 15:1-21.</description>
    <description>From 'Ayun Musa they went on for three days through a part of the barren "wilderness of Shur" (22), called also the "wilderness of Etham" (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 33:8; comp. Ex. 13:20</reflink>), without finding water. On the last of these days they came to Marah (q.v.), where the "bitter" water was by a miracle made drinkable.</description>
    <description>Their next camping-place was Elim (q.v.), where were twelve springs of water and a grove of "threescore and ten" palm trees (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 15:27</reflink>).</description>
    <description>After a time the children of Israel "took their journey from Elim," and encamped by the Red Sea (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 33:10</reflink>), and thence removed to the "wilderness of Sin" (to be distinguished from the wilderness of Zin, 20:1), where they again encamped. Here, probably the modern el-Markha, the supply of bread they had brought with them out of Egypt failed. They began to "murmur" for want of bread. God "heard their murmurings" and gave them quails and manna, "bread from heaven" (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 16:4-36</reflink>). Moses directed that an omer of manna should be put aside and preserved as a perpetual memorial of God's goodness. They now turned inland, and after three encampments came to the rich and fertile valley of Rephidim, in the Wady Feiran. Here they found no water, and again murmured against Moses. Directed by God, Moses procured a miraculous supply of water from the "rock in Horeb," one of the hills of the Sinai group (17:1-7); and shortly afterwards the children of Israel here fought their first battle with the Amalekites, whom they smote with the edge of the sword.</description>
    <description>From the eastern extremity of the Wady Feiran the line of march now probably led through the Wady esh-Sheikh and the Wady Solaf, meeting in the Wady er-Rahah, "the enclosed plain in front of the magnificient cliffs of Ras Sufsafeh." Here they encamped for more than a year (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 1:1; 10:11</reflink>) before Sinai (q.v.).</description>
    <description>The different encampments of the children of Israel, from the time of their leaving Egypt till they reached the Promised Land, are mentioned in Ex. 12:37-19; Num. 10-21; 33; Deut. 1, 2, 10.</description>
    <description>It is worthy of notice that there are unmistakable evidences that the Egyptians had a tradition of a great exodus from their country, which could be none other than the exodus of the Hebrews.</description>

  <item id="Exodus, Book of">
    <description>Exodus is the name given in the LXX. to the second book of the Pentateuch (q.v.). It means "departure" or "outgoing." This name was adopted in the Latin translation, and thence passed into other languages. The Hebrews called it by the first words, according to their custom, Ve-eleh shemoth (i.e., "and these are the names").</description>
    <description>It contains, (1.) An account of the increase and growth of the Israelites in Egypt (ch. 1) (2.) Preparations for their departure out of Egypt (2-12:36). (3.) Their journeyings from Egypt to Sinai (12:37-19:2). (4.) The giving of the law and the establishment of the institutions by which the organization of the people was completed, the theocracy, "a kingdom of priest and an holy nation" (19:3-ch. 40).</description>
    <description>The time comprised in this book, from the death of Joseph to the erection of the tabernacle in the wilderness, is about one hundred and forty-five years, on the supposition that the four hundred and thirty years (12:40) are to be computed from the time of the promises made to Abraham (<reflink target="XXX">Gal. 3:17</reflink>).</description>
    <description>The authorship of this book, as well as of that of the other books of the Pentateuch, is to be ascribed to Moses. The unanimous voice of tradition and all internal evidences abundantly support this opinion.</description>

  <item id="Exorcist">
    <description>(<reflink target="XXX">Acts 19:13</reflink>). "In that sceptical and therefore superstitious age professional exorcist abounded. Many of these professional exorcists were disreputable Jews, like Simon in Samaria and Elymas in Cyprus (8:9; 13:6)." Other references to exorcism as practised by the Jews are found in Matt. 12:27; Mark 9:38; Luke 9:49, 50. It would seem that it was an opinion among the Jews that miracles might be wrought by invoking the divine name. Thus also these "vagabond Jews" pretended that they could expel daemons.</description>
    <description>The power of casting out devils was conferred by Christ on his apostles (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 10:8</reflink>), and on the seventy (<reflink target="XXX">Luke 10:17-19</reflink>), and was exercised by believers after his ascension (<reflink target="XXX">Mark 16:17; Acts 16:18</reflink>); but this power was never spoken of as exorcism.</description>

  <item id="Expiation">
    <description>Guilt is said to be expiated when it is visited with punishment falling on a substitute. Expiation is made for our sins when they are punished not in ourselves but in another who consents to stand in our room. It is that by which reconciliation is effected. Sin is thus said to be "covered" by vicarious satisfaction.</description>
    <description>The cover or lid of the ark is termed in the LXX. hilasterion, that which covered or shut out the claims and demands of the law against the sins of God's people, whereby he became "propitious" to them.</description>

    <description>The expression (<reflink target="XXX">Prov. 23:31</reflink>), "when it giveth his colour in the cup," is literally, "when it giveth out [or showeth] its eye." The beads or bubbles of wine are thus spoken of. "To set the eyes" on any one is to view him with favour (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 44:21; Job 24:23; Jer. 39:12</reflink>). This word is used figuratively in the expressions an "evil eye" (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 20:15</reflink>), a "bountiful eye" (<reflink target="XXX">Prov. 22:9</reflink>), "haughty eyes" (6:17 marg.), "wanton eyes" (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 3:16</reflink>), "eyes full of adultery" (<reflink target="XXX">2 Pet. 2:14</reflink>), "the lust of the eyes" (<reflink target="XXX">1 John 2:16</reflink>). Christians are warned against "eye-service" (<reflink target="XXX">Eph. 6:6; Col. 3:22</reflink>).

    <description>(2.) One of the great prophets, the son of Buzi the priest (<reflink target="XXX">Ezek. 1:3</reflink>). He was one of the Jewish exiles who settled at Tel-Abib, on the banks of the Chebar, "in the land of the Chaldeans." He was probably carried away captive with Jehoiachin (1:2; 2 Kings 24:14-16) about B.C. 597. His prophetic call came to him "in the fifth year of Jehoiachin's captivity" (B.C. 594). He had a house in the place of his exile, where he lost his wife, in the ninth year of his exile, by some sudden and unforeseen stroke (<reflink target="XXX">Ezek. 8:1; 24:18</reflink>). He held a prominent place among the exiles, and was frequently consulted by the elders (8:1; 11:25; 14:1; 20:1). His ministry extended over twenty-three years (29:17), B.C. 595-573, during part of which he was contemporary with Daniel (14:14; 28:3) and Jeremiah, and probably also with Obadiah. The time and manner of his death are unknown. His reputed tomb is pointed out in the neighbourhood of Bagdad, at a place called Keffil.</description>

The symbolical acts, by which the extremities to which Jerusalem would be reduced are described in ch. 4,5, show his intimate acquaintance with the Levitical legislation. (<reflink target="XXX">See Ex. 22:30; Deut. 14:21; Lev. 5:2; 7:18,24; 17:15; 19:7; 22:8, etc.</reflink>)</description>
    <description>(2.) Prophecies against various surrounding nations: against the Ammonites (<reflink target="XXX">Ezek. 25:1-7</reflink>), the Moabites (8-11), the Edomites (12-14), the Philistines (15-17), Tyre and Sidon (26-28), and against Egypt (29-32).</description>
    <description>(3.) Prophecies delivered after the destruction of Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar: the triumphs of Israel and of the kingdom of God on earth (Ezek. 33-39); Messianic times, and the establishment and prosperity of the kingdom of God (40;48).</description>
    <description>The closing visions of this book are referred to in the book of Revelation (Ezek. 38=Rev. 20:8; Ezek. 47:1-8=Rev. 22:1,2). Other references to this book are also found in the New Testament. (<reflink target="XXX">Comp. Rom. 2:24 with Ezek. 36:2; Rom. 10:5, Gal. 3:12 with Ezek. 20:11; 2 Pet. 3:4 with Ezek. 12:22.</reflink>)</description>
    <description>It may be noted that Daniel, fourteen years after his deportation from Jerusalem, is mentioned by Ezekiel (14:14) along with Noah and Job as distinguished for his righteousness, and some five years later he is spoken of as pre-eminent for his wisdom (28:3).</description>
    <description>Ezekiel's prophecies are characterized by symbolical and allegorical representations, "unfolding a rich series of majestic visions and of colossal symbols." There are a great many also of "symbolcal actions embodying vivid conceptions on the part of the prophet" (4:1-4; 5:1-4; 12:3-6; 24:3-5; 37:16, etc.) "The mode of representation, in which symbols and allegories occupy a prominent place, gives a dark, mysterious character to the prophecies of Ezekiel. They are obscure and enigmatical. A cloudy mystery overhangs them which it is almost impossible to penetrate. Jerome calls the book 'a labyrith of the mysteries of God.' It was because of this obscurity that the Jews forbade any one to read it till he had attained the age of thirty."</description>
    <description>Ezekiel is singular in the frequency with which he refers to the Pentateuch (e.g., Ezek. 27; 28:13; 31:8; 36:11, 34; 47:13, etc.). He shows also an acquaintance with the writings of Hosea (<reflink target="XXX">Ezek. 37:22</reflink>), Isaiah (<reflink target="XXX">Ezek. 8:12; 29:6</reflink>), and especially with those of Jeremiah, his older contemporary (<reflink target="XXX">Jer. 24:7, 9; 48:37</reflink>).</description>

Here Solomon built ships, "Tarshish ships," like those trading from Tyre to Tarshish and the west, which traded with Ophir (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 9:26; 2 Chr. 8:17</reflink>); and here also Jehoshaphat's fleet was shipwrecked (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 22:48; 2 Chr. 20:36</reflink>). It became a populous town, many of the Jews settling in it (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 16:6, "Elath"</reflink>). It is supposed that anciently the north end of the gulf flowed further into the country than now, as far as 'Ain el-Ghudyan, which is 10 miles up the dry bed of the Arabah, and that Ezion-geber may have been there.</description>

  <item id="Ezra">
    <description>help. (1.) A priest among those that returned to Jerusalem under Zerubabel (<reflink target="XXX">Neh. 12:1</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(2.) The "scribe" who led the second body of exiles that returned from Babylon to Jerusalem B.C. 459, and author of the book of Scripture which bears his name. He was the son, or perhaps grandson, of Seraiah (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 25:18-21</reflink>), and a lineal descendant of Phinehas, the son of Aaron (<reflink target="XXX">Ezra 7:1-5</reflink>). All we know of his personal history is contained in the last four chapters of his book, and in Neh. 8 and 12:26.</description>
    <description>In the seventh year of the reign of Artaxerxes Longimanus (<see target="x-self">see DARIUS</see>), he obtained leave to go up to Jerusalem and to take with him a company of Israelites (Ezra 8). Artaxerxes manifested great interest in Ezra's undertaking, granting him "all his request," and loading him with gifts for the house of God. Ezra assembled the band of exiles, probably about 5,000 in all, who were prepared to go up with him to Jerusalem, on the banks of the Ahava, where they rested for three days, and were put into order for their march across the desert, which was completed in four months. His proceedings at Jerusalem on his arrival there are recorded in his book.</description>
    <description>He was "a ready scribe in the law of Moses," who "had prepared his heart to seek the law of the Lord and to do it, and to teach in Israel statutes and judgments." "He is," says Professor Binnie, "the first well-defined example of an order of men who have never since ceased in the church; men of sacred erudition, who devote their lives to the study of the Holy Scriptures, in order that they may be in a condition to interpret them for the instruction and edification of the church. It is significant that the earliest mention of the pulpit occurs in the history of Ezra's ministry (<reflink target="XXX">Neh. 8:4</reflink>). He was much more of a teacher than a priest. We learn from the account of his labours in the book of Nehemiah that he was careful to have the whole people instructed in the law of Moses; and there is no reason to reject the constant tradition of the Jews which connects his name with the collecting and editing of the Old Testament canon. The final completion of the canon may have been, and probably was, the work of a later generation; but Ezra seems to have put it much into the shape in which it is still found in the Hebrew Bible. When it is added that the complete organization of the synagogue dates from this period, it will be seen that the age was emphatically one of Biblical study" (The Psalms: their History, etc.).</description>
    <description>For about fourteen years, i.e., till B.C. 445, we have no record of what went on in Jerusalem after Ezra had set in order the ecclesiastical and civil affairs of the nation. In that year another distinguished personage, Nehemiah, appears on the scene. After the ruined wall of the city had been built by Nehemiah, there was a great gathering of the people at Jerusalem preparatory to the dedication of the wall. On the appointed day the whole population assembled, and the law was read aloud to them by Ezra and his assistants (<reflink target="XXX">Neh. 8:3</reflink>). The remarkable scene is described in detail. There was a great religious awakening. For successive days they held solemn assemblies, confessing their sins and offering up solemn sacrifices. They kept also the feast of Tabernacles with great solemnity and joyous enthusiasm, and then renewed their national covenant to be the Lord's. Abuses were rectified, and arrangements for the temple service completed, and now nothing remained but the dedication of the walls of the city (Neh. 12).</description>

  <item id="Ezra, Book of">
    <description>This book is the record of events occurring at the close of the Babylonian exile. It was at one time included in Nehemiah, the Jews regarding them as one volume. The two are still distinguished in the Vulgate version as I. and II. Esdras. It consists of two principal divisions:</description>
    <description>(1.) The history of the first return of exiles, in the first year of Cyrus (B.C. 536), till the completion and dedication of the new temple, in the sixth year of Darius Hystapes (B.C. 515), ch. 1-6. From the close of the sixth to the opening of the seventh chapter there is a blank in the history of about sixty years.</description>
    <description>(2.) The history of the second return under Ezra, in the seventh year of Artaxerxes Longimanus, and of the events that took place at Jerusalem after Ezra's arrival there (7-10).</description>
    <description>The book thus contains memorabilia connected with the Jews, from the decree of Cyrus (B.C. 536) to the reformation by Ezra (B.C. 456), extending over a period of about eighty years.</description>
    <description>There is no quotation from this book in the New Testament, but there never has been any doubt about its being canonical. Ezra was probably the author of this book, at least of the greater part of it (<reflink target="XXX">comp. 7:27, 28; 8:1, etc.</reflink>), as he was also of the Books of Chronicles, the close of which forms the opening passage of Ezra.</description>

  <item id="Fable">
    <description>applied in the New Testament to the traditions and speculations, "cunningly devised fables", of the Jews on religious questions (<reflink target="XXX">1 Tim. 1:4; 4:7; 2 Tim. 4:4; Titus 1:14; 2 Pet. 1:16</reflink>). In such passages the word means anything false and unreal. But the word is used as almost equivalent to parable. Thus we have (1) the fable of Jotham, in which the trees are spoken of as choosing a king (<reflink target="XXX">Judg. 9:8-15</reflink>); and (2) that of the cedars of Lebanon and the thistle as Jehoash's answer to Amaziah (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 14:9</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Face">
    <description>means simply presence, as when it is recorded that Adam and Eve hid themselves from the "face [R.V., 'presence'] of the Lord God" (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 3:8; comp. Ex. 33:14, 15, where the same Hebrew word is rendered "presence"</reflink>). The "light of God's countenance" is his favour (<reflink target="XXX">Ps. 44:3; Dan. 9:17</reflink>). "Face" signifies also anger, justice, severity (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 16:6, 8; Ex. 2:15; Ps. 68:1; Rev. 6:16</reflink>). To "provoke God to his face" (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 65:3</reflink>) is to sin against him openly.</description>
    <description>The Jews prayed with their faces toward the temple and Jerusalem (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 8:38, 44, 48; Dan. 6:10</reflink>). To "see God's face" is to have access to him and to enjoy his favour (<reflink target="XXX">Ps. 17:15; 27:8</reflink>). This is the privilege of holy angels (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 18:10; Luke 1:19</reflink>). The "face of Jesus Christ" (<reflink target="XXX">2 Cor. 4:6</reflink>) is the office and person of Christ, the revealer of the glory of God (<reflink target="XXX">John 1:14, 18</reflink>).</description>

Here the ship of Alexandria in which Paul and his companions sailed was detained a considerable time waiting for a favourable wind. Contrary to Paul's advice, the master of the ship determined to prosecute the voyage, as the harbour was deemed incommodious for wintering in (9-12). The result was that, after a stormy voyage, the vessel was finally wrecked on the coast of Malta (27:40-44).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Fairs">
    <description>(Heb. 'izabhonim), found seven times in Ezek. 27, and nowhere else. The Authorized Version renders the word thus in all these instances, except in verse 33, where "wares" is used. The Revised Version uniformly renders by "wares," which is the correct rendering of the Hebrew word. It never means "fairs" in the modern sense of the word.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Faith">
    <description>Faith is in general the persuasion of the mind that a certain statement is true (<reflink target="XXX">Phil. 1:27; 2 Thess. 2:13</reflink>). Its primary idea is trust. A thing is true, and therefore worthy of trust. It admits of many degrees up to full assurance of faith, in accordance with the evidence on which it rests.</description>
    <description>Faith is the result of teaching (<reflink target="XXX">Rom. 10:14-17</reflink>). Knowledge is an essential element in all faith, and is sometimes spoken of as an equivalent to faith (<reflink target="XXX">John 10:38; 1 John 2:3</reflink>). Yet the two are distinguished in this respect, that faith includes in it assent, which is an act of the will in addition to the act of the understanding. Assent to the truth is of the essence of faith, and the ultimate ground on which our assent to any revealed truth rests is the veracity of God.</description>
    <description>Historical faith is the apprehension of and assent to certain statements which are regarded as mere facts of history.</description>
    <description>Temporary faith is that state of mind which is awakened in men (e.g., Felix) by the exhibition of the truth and by the influence of religious sympathy, or by what is sometimes styled the common operation of the Holy Spirit.</description>
    <description>Saving faith is so called because it has eternal life inseparably connected with it. It cannot be better defined than in the words of the Assembly's Shorter Catechism: "Faith in Jesus Christ is a saving grace, whereby we receive and rest upon him alone for salvation, as he is offered to us in the gospel."</description>
    <description>The object of saving faith is the whole revealed Word of God. Faith accepts and believes it as the very truth most sure. But the special act of faith which unites to Christ has as its object the person and the work of the Lord Jesus Christ (<reflink target="XXX">John 7:38; Acts 16:31</reflink>). This is the specific act of faith by which a sinner is justified before God (<reflink target="XXX">Rom. 3:22, 25; Gal. 2:16; Phil. 3:9; John 3:16-36; Acts 10:43; 16:31</reflink>). In this act of faith the believer appropriates and rests on Christ alone as Mediator in all his offices.</description>
    <description>This assent to or belief in the truth received upon the divine testimony has always associated with it a deep sense of sin, a distinct view of Christ, a consenting will, and a loving heart, together with a reliance on, a trusting in, or resting in Christ. It is that state of mind in which a poor sinner, conscious of his sin, flees from his guilty self to Christ his Saviour, and rolls over the burden of all his sins on him. It consists chiefly, not in the assent given to the testimony of God in his Word, but in embracing with fiducial reliance and trust the one and only Saviour whom God reveals. This trust and reliance is of the essence of faith. By faith the believer directly and immediately appropriates Christ as his own. Faith in its direct act makes Christ ours. It is not a work which God graciously accepts instead of perfect obedience, but is only the hand by which we take hold of the person and work of our Redeemer as the only ground of our salvation.</description>
    <description>Saving faith is a moral act, as it proceeds from a renewed will, and a renewed will is necessary to believing assent to the truth of God (<reflink target="XXX">1 Cor. 2:14; 2 Cor. 4:4</reflink>). Faith, therefore, has its seat in the moral part of our nature fully as much as in the intellectual. The mind must first be enlightened by divine teaching (<reflink target="XXX">John 6:44; Acts 13:48; 2 Cor. 4:6; Eph. 1:17, 18</reflink>) before it can discern the things of the Spirit.</description>
    <description>Faith is necessary to our salvation (<reflink target="XXX">Mark 16:16</reflink>), not because there is any merit in it, but simply because it is the sinner's taking the place assigned him by God, his falling in with what God is doing.</description>
    <description>The warrant or ground of faith is the divine testimony, not the reasonableness of what God says, but the simple fact that he says it. Faith rests immediately on, "Thus saith the Lord." But in order to this faith the veracity, sincerity, and truth of God must be owned and appreciated, together with his unchangeableness. God's word encourages and emboldens the sinner personally to transact with Christ as God's gift, to close with him, embrace him, give himself to Christ, and take Christ as his. That word comes with power, for it is the word of God who has revealed himself in his works, and especially in the cross. God is to be believed for his word's sake, but also for his name's sake.</description>
    <description>Faith in Christ secures for the believer freedom from condemnation, or justification before God; a participation in the life that is in Christ, the divine life (<reflink target="XXX">John 14:19; Rom. 6:4-10; Eph. 4:15,16, etc.</reflink>); "peace with God" (<reflink target="XXX">Rom. 5:1</reflink>); and sanctification (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 26:18; Gal. 5:6; Acts 15:9</reflink>).</description>
    <description>All who thus believe in Christ will certainly be saved (<reflink target="XXX">John 6:37, 40; 10:27, 28; Rom. 8:1</reflink>).</description>
    <description>The faith=the gospel (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 6:7; Rom. 1:5; Gal. 1:23; 1 Tim. 3:9; Jude 1:3</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Faithful">
    <description>as a designation of Christians, means full of faith, trustful, and not simply trustworthy (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 10:45; 16:1; 2 Cor. 6:15; Col. 1:2; 1 Tim. 4:3, 12; 5:16; 6:2; Titus 1:6; Eph. 1:1; 1 Cor. 4:17, etc.</reflink>).</description>
    <description>It is used also of God's word or covenant as true and to be trusted (<reflink target="XXX">Ps. 119:86, 138; Isa. 25:1; 1 Tim. 1:15; Rev. 21:5; 22:6, etc.</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Fall of man">
    <description>an expression probably borrowed from the Apocryphal Book of Wisdom, to express the fact of the revolt of our first parents from God, and the consequent sin and misery in which they and all their posterity were involved.</description>
    <description>The history of the Fall is recorded in Gen. 2 and 3. That history is to be literally interpreted. It records facts which underlie the whole system of revealed truth. It is referred to by our Lord and his apostles not only as being true, but as furnishing the ground of all God's subsequent dispensations and dealings with the children of men. The record of Adam's temptation and fall must be taken as a true historical account, if we are to understand the Bible at all as a revelation of God's purpose of mercy.</description>
    <description>The effects of this first sin upon our first parents themselves were (1) "shame, a sense of degradation and pollution; (2) dread of the displeasure of God, or a sense of guilt, and the consequent desire to hide from his presence. These effects were unavoidable. They prove the loss not only of innocence but of original righteousness, and, with it, of the favour and fellowship of God. The state therefore to which Adam was reduced by his disobedience, so far as his subjective condition is concerned, was analogous to that of the fallen angels. He was entirely and absolutely ruined" (Hodge's Theology).</description>
    <description>But the unbelief and disobedience of our first parents brought not only on themselves this misery and ruin, it entailed also the same sad consequences on all their descendants. (1.) The guilt, i.e., liability to punishment, of that sin comes by imputation upon all men, because all were represented by Adam in the covenant of works (q.v.). (<see target="x-self">See IMPUTATION.</see>)</description>
    <description>(2.) Hence, also, all his descendants inherit a corrupt nature. In all by nature there is an inherent and prevailing tendency to sin. This universal depravity is taught by universal experience. All men sin as soon as they are capable of moral actions. The testimony of the Scriptures to the same effect is most abundant (Rom. 1; 2; 3:1-19, etc.).</description>
    <description>(3.) This innate depravity is total: we are by nature "dead in trespasses and sins," and must be "born again" before we can enter into the kingdom (<reflink target="XXX">John 3:7, etc.</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(4.) Resulting from this "corruption of our whole nature" is our absolute moral inability to change our nature or to obey the law of God.</description>
    <description>Commenting on John 9:3, Ryle well remarks: "A deep and instructive principle lies in these words. They surely throw some light on that great question, the origin of evil. God has thought fit to allow evil to exist in order that he may have a platform for showing his mercy, grace, and compassion. If man had never fallen there would have been no opportunity of showing divine mercy. But by permitting evil, mysterious as it seems, God's works of grace, mercy, and wisdom in saving sinners have been wonderfully manifested to all his creatures. The redeeming of the church of elect sinners is the means of 'showing to principalities and powers the manifold wisdom of God' (<reflink target="XXX">Eph. 3:10</reflink>). Without the Fall we should have known nothing of the Cross and the Gospel."</description>
    <description>On the monuments of Egypt are found representations of a deity in human form, piercing with a spear the head of a serpent. This is regarded as an illustration of the wide dissemination of the tradition of the Fall. The story of the "golden age," which gives place to the "iron age", the age of purity and innocence, which is followed by a time when man becomes a prey to sin and misery, as represented in the mythology of Greece and Rome, has also been regarded as a tradition of the Fall.</description>

  <item id="Fallow-deer">
    <description>Deut. 14:5 (R.V., "Wild goat"); 1 Kings 4:23 (R.V., "roebucks"). This animal, called in Hebrew _yahmur_, from a word meaning "to be red," is regarded by some as the common fallow-deer, the Cervus dama, which is said to be found very generally over Western and Southern Asia. It is called "fallow" from its pale-red or yellow colour. Some interpreters, however, regard the name as designating the bubale, Antelope bubale, the "wild cow" of North Africa, which is about the size of a stag, like the hartebeest of South Africa. A species of deer has been found at Mount Carmel which is called _yahmur_ by the Arabs. It is said to be similar to the European roebuck.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Fallow-ground">
    <description>The expression, "Break up your fallow ground" (<reflink target="XXX">Hos. 10:12; Jer. 4:3</reflink>) means, "Do not sow your seed among thorns", i.e., break off all your evil habits; clear your hearts of weeds, in order that they may be prepared for the seed of righteousness. Land was allowed to lie fallow that it might become more fruitful; but when in this condition, it soon became overgrown with thorns and weeds. The cultivator of the soil was careful to "break up" his fallow ground, i.e., to clear the field of weeds, before sowing seed in it. So says the prophet, "Break off your evil ways, repent of your sins, cease to do evil, and then the good seed of the word will have room to grow and bear fruit."</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Familiar spirit">
    <description>Sorcerers or necormancers, who professed to call up the dead to answer questions, were said to have a "familiar spirit" (<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 18:11; 2 Kings 21:6; 2 Chr. 33:6; Lev. 19:31; 20:6; Isa. 8:19; 29:4</reflink>). Such a person was called by the Hebrews an _'ob_, which properly means a leathern bottle; for sorcerers were regarded as vessels containing the inspiring demon. This Hebrew word was equivalent to the pytho of the Greeks, and was used to denote both the person and the spirit which possessed him (<reflink target="XXX">Lev. 20:27; 1 Sam. 28:8; comp. Acts 16:16</reflink>). The word "familiar" is from the Latin familiaris, meaning a "household servant," and was intended to express the idea that sorcerers had spirits as their servants ready to obey their commands.</description>

  <item id="Famine">
    <description>The first mentioned in Scripture was so grievous as to compel Abraham to go down to the land of Egypt (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 26:1</reflink>). Another is mentioned as having occurred in the days of Isaac, causing him to go to Gerar (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 26:1, 17</reflink>). But the most remarkable of all was that which arose in Egypt in the days of Joseph, which lasted for seven years (Gen. 41-45).</description>
    <description>Famines were sent as an effect of God's anger against a guilty people (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 8:1, 2; Amos 8:11; Deut. 28:22-42; 2 Sam. 21:1; 2 Kings 6:25-28; 25:3; Jer. 14:15; 19:9; 42:17, etc.</reflink>). A famine was predicted by Agabus (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 11:28</reflink>). Josephus makes mention of the famine which occurred A.D. 45. Helena, queen of Adiabene, being at Jerusalem at that time, procured corn from Alexandria and figs from Cyprus for its poor inhabitants.</description>

    <description>(<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 22:5</reflink>). Every Hebrew had a certain portion of land assigned to him as a possession (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 26:33-56</reflink>). In Egypt the lands all belonged to the king, and the husbandmen were obliged to give him a fifth part of the produce; so in Palestine Jehovah was the sole possessor of the soil, and the people held it by direct tenure from him. By the enactment of Moses, the Hebrews paid a tithe of the produce to Jehovah, which was assigned to the priesthood. Military service when required was also to be rendered by every Hebrew at his own expense. The occuptaion of a husbandman was held in high honour (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 11:5-7; 1 Kings 19:19; 2 Chr. 26:10</reflink>).

  <item id="Fast">
    <description>The sole fast required by the law of Moses was that of the great Day of Atonement (q.v.), Lev. 23:26-32. It is called "the fast" (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 27:9</reflink>).</description>
    <description>The only other mention of a periodical fast in the Old Testament is in Zech. 7:1-7; 8:19, from which it appears that during their captivity the Jews observed four annual fasts.</description>
    <description>(1.) The fast of the fourth month, kept on the seventeenth day of Tammuz, the anniversary of the capture of Jerusalem by the Chaldeans; to commemorate also the incident recorded Ex. 32:19. (<reflink target="XXX">Comp. Jer. 52:6, 7.</reflink>)</description>
    <description>(2.) The fast of the fifth month, kept on the ninth of Ab (<reflink target="XXX">comp. Num. 14:27</reflink>), to commemorate the burning of the city and temple (<reflink target="XXX">Jer. 52:12, 13</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(3.) The fast of the seventh month, kept on the third of Tisri (comp. 2 Kings 25), the anniversary of the murder of Gedaliah (<reflink target="XXX">Jer. 41:1, 2</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(4.) The fast of the tenth month (<reflink target="XXX">comp. Jer. 52:4; Ezek. 33:21; 2 Kings 25:1</reflink>), to commemorate the beginning of the siege of the holy city by Nebuchadnezzar.</description>
    <description>There was in addition to these the fast appointed by Esther (4:16).</description>
    <description>Public national fasts on account of sin or to supplicate divine favour were sometimes held. (1.) 1 Sam. 7:6; (2.) 2 Chr. 20:3; (3.) Jer. 36:6-10; (4.) Neh. 9:1.</description>
    <description>There were also local fasts. (1.) Judg. 20:26; (2.) 2 Sam. 1:12; (3.) 1 Sam. 31:13; (4.) 1 Kings 21:9-12; (5.) Ezra 8:21-23: (6.) Jonah 3:5-9.</description>
    <description>There are many instances of private occasional fasting (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 1:7: 20:34; 2 Sam. 3:35; 12:16; 1 Kings 21:27; Ezra 10:6; Neh. 1:4; Dan. 10:2,3</reflink>). Moses fasted forty days (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 24:18; 34:28</reflink>), and so also did Elijah (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 19:8</reflink>). Our Lord fasted forty days in the wilderness (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 4:2</reflink>).</description>
    <description>In the lapse of time the practice of fasting was lamentably abused (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 58:4; Jer. 14:12; Zech. 7:5</reflink>). Our Lord rebuked the Pharisees for their hypocritical pretences in fasting (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 6:16</reflink>). He himself appointed no fast. The early Christians, however, observed the ordinary fasts according to the law of their fathers (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 13:3; 14:23; 2 Cor. 6:5</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Fat">
    <description>(Heb. heleb) denotes the richest part of the animal, or the fattest of the flock, in the account of Abel's sacrifice (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 4:4</reflink>). It sometimes denotes the best of any production (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 45:18; Num. 18:12; Ps. 81:16; 147:47</reflink>). The fat of sacrifices was to be burned (<reflink target="XXX">Lev. 3:9-11; 4:8; 7:3; 8:25; Num. 18:17. Comp. Ex. 29:13-22; Lev. 3:3-5</reflink>).</description>
    <description>It is used figuratively for a dull, stupid state of mind (<reflink target="XXX">Ps 17:10</reflink>).</description>
    <description>In Joel 2:24 the word is equivalent to "vat," a vessel. The hebrew word here thus rendered is elsewhere rendered "wine-fat" and "press-fat" (<reflink target="XXX">Hag. 2:16; Isa. 63:2</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Father">
    <description>a name applied (1) to any ancestor (<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 1:11; 1 Kings 15:11; Matt. 3:9; 23:30, etc.</reflink>); and (2) as a title of respect to a chief, ruler, or elder, etc. (<reflink target="XXX">Judg. 17:10; 18:19; 1 Sam. 10:12; 2 Kings 2:12; Matt. 23:9, etc.</reflink>). (3) The author or beginner of anything is also so called; e.g., Jabal and Jubal (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 4:20, 21; comp. Job 38:28</reflink>).</description>
    <description>Applied to God (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 4:22; Deut. 32:6; 2 Sam. 7:14; Ps. 89:27, 28, etc.</reflink>). (1.) As denoting his covenant relation to the Jews (<reflink target="XXX">Jer. 31:9; Isa. 63:16; 64:8; John 8:41, etc.</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(2.) Believers are called God's "sons" (<reflink target="XXX">John 1:12; Rom. 8:16; Matt. 6:4, 8, 15, 18; 10:20, 29</reflink>). They also call him "Father" (<reflink target="XXX">Rom. 1:7; 1 Cor. 1:3; 2 Cor. 1:2; Gal. 1:4</reflink>)</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Fathom">
    <description>(Old A.S. faethm, "bosom," or the outstretched arms), a span of six feet (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 27:28</reflink>). Gr. orguia (from orego, "I stretch"), the distance between the extremities of both arms fully stretched out.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Fatling">
    <description>(1.) A fatted animal for slaughter (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 6:13; Isa. 11:6; Ezek. 39:18. Comp. Matt. 22:4, where the word used in the original, sitistos, means literally "corn-fed;" i.e., installed, fat</reflink>). (2.) Ps. 66:15 (Heb. meah, meaning "marrowy," "fat," a species of sheep). (3.) 1 Sam. 15:9 (Heb. mishneh, meaning "the second," and hence probably "cattle of a second quality," or lambs of the second birth, i.e., autmnal lambs, and therfore of less value).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Fear of the Lord the">
    <description>is in the Old Testament used as a designation of true piety (<reflink target="XXX">Prov. 1:7; Job 28:28; Ps. 19:9</reflink>). It is a fear conjoined with love and hope, and is therefore not a slavish dread, but rather filial reverence. (<reflink target="XXX">Comp. Deut. 32:6; Hos. 11:1; Isa. 1:2; 63:16; 64:8.</reflink>) God is called "the Fear of Isaac" (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 31:42, 53</reflink>), i.e., the God whom Isaac feared.</description>
    <description>A holy fear is enjoined also in the New Testament as a preventive of carelessness in religion, and as an incentive to penitence (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 10:28; 2 Cor. 5:11; 7:1; Phil. 2:12; Eph. 5:21; Heb. 12:28, 29</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Feast">
    <description>as a mark of hospitality (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 19:3; 2 Sam. 3:20; 2 Kings 6:23</reflink>); on occasions of domestic joy (<reflink target="XXX">Luke 15:23; Gen. 21:8</reflink>); on birthdays (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 40:20; Job 1:4; Matt. 14:6</reflink>); and on the occasion of a marriage (<reflink target="XXX">Judg. 14:10; Gen. 29:22</reflink>).</description>
    <description>Feasting was a part of the observances connected with the offering up of sacrifices (<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 12:6, 7; 1 Sam. 9:19; 16:3, 5</reflink>), and with the annual festivals (<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 16:11</reflink>). "It was one of the designs of the greater solemnities, which required the attendance of the people at the sacred tent, that the oneness of the nation might be maintained and cemented together, by statedly congregating in one place, and with one soul taking part in the same religious services. But that oneness was primarily and chiefly a religious and not merely a political one; the people were not merely to meet as among themselves, but with Jehovah, and to present themselves before him as one body; the meeting was in its own nature a binding of themselves in fellowship with Jehovah; so that it was not politics and commerce that had here to do, but the soul of the Mosaic dispensation, the foundation of the religious and political existence of Israel, the covenant with Jehovah. To keep the people's consciousness alive to this, to revive, strengthen, and perpetuate it, nothing could be so well adapated as these annual feasts." (<see target="x-self">See FESTIVALS.</see>)</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Felix">
    <description>happy, the Roman procurator of Judea before whom Paul "reasoned" (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 24:25</reflink>). He appears to have expected a bribe from Paul, and therefore had several interviews with him. The "worthy deeds" referred to in 24:2 was his clearing the country of banditti and impostors.</description>
    <description>At the end of a two years' term, Porcius Festus was appointed in the room of Felix (A.D. 60), who proceeded to Rome, and was there accused of cruelty and malversation of office by the Jews of Caesarea. The accusation was rendered nugatory by the influence of his brother Pallas with Nero. (<see target="x-self">See Josephus, Ant. xx. 8, 9.</see>)</description>
    <description>Drusilla, the daughter of Herod Agrippa, having been induced by Felix to desert her husband, the king of Emesa, became his adulterous companion. She was seated beside him when Paul "reasoned" before the judge. When Felix gave place to Festus, being "willing to do the Jews a pleasure," he left Paul bound.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Fellowship">
    <description>(1.) With God, consisting in the knowledge of his will (<reflink target="XXX">Job 22:21; John 17:3</reflink>); agreement with his designs (<reflink target="XXX">Amos 3:2</reflink>); mutual affection (<reflink target="XXX">Rom. 8: 38, 39</reflink>); enjoyment of his presence (<reflink target="XXX">Ps. 4:6</reflink>); conformity to his image (<reflink target="XXX">1 John 2:6; 1:6</reflink>); and participation of his felicity (<reflink target="XXX">1 John 1:3, 4; Eph. 3:14-21</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(2.) Of saints with one another, in duties (<reflink target="XXX">Rom. 12:5; 1 Cor. 12:1; 1 Thess. 5:17, 18</reflink>); in ordinances (<reflink target="XXX">Heb. 10:25; Acts 2:46</reflink>); in grace, love, joy, etc. (<reflink target="XXX">Mal. 3:16; 2 Cor. 8:4</reflink>); mutual interest, spiritual and temporal (<reflink target="XXX">Rom. 12:4, 13; Heb. 13:16</reflink>); in sufferings (<reflink target="XXX">Rom. 15:1, 2; Gal. 6:1, 2; Rom. 12:15; and in glory (<reflink target="XXX">Rev. 7:9</reflink></reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Fence">
    <description>(Heb. gader), Num. 22:24 (R.V.). Fences were constructions of unmortared stones, to protect gardens, vineyards, sheepfolds, etc. From various causes they were apt to bulge out and fall (<reflink target="XXX">Ps. 62:3</reflink>). In Ps. 80:12, R.V. (<reflink target="XXX">see Isa. 5:5</reflink>), the psalmist says, "Why hast thou broken down her fences?" Serpents delight to lurk in the crevices of such fences (<reflink target="XXX">Eccl. 10:8; comp. Amos 5:19</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Fenced cities">
    <description>There were in Palestine (1) cities, (2) unwalled villages, and (3) villages with castles or towers (<reflink target="XXX">1 Chr. 27:25</reflink>). Cities, so called, had walls, and were thus fenced. The fortifications consisted of one or two walls, on which were towers or parapets at regular intervals (<reflink target="XXX">2 Chr. 32:5; Jer. 31:38</reflink>). Around ancient Jerusalem were three walls, on one of which were ninety towers, on the second fourteen, and on the third sixty. The tower of Hananeel, near the north-east corner of the city wall, is frequently referred to (<reflink target="XXX">Neh. 3:1; 12:39; Zech. 14:10</reflink>). The gateways of such cities were also fortified (<reflink target="XXX">Neh. 2:8; 3:3, 6; Judg. 16:2, 3; 1 Sam. 23:7</reflink>).</description>
    <description>The Hebrews found many fenced cities when they entered the Promised Land (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 13:28; 32:17, 34-42; Josh. 11:12, 13; Judg. 1:27-33</reflink>), and we may estimate the strength of some of these cities from the fact that they were long held in possession by the Canaanites. The Jebusites, e.g., were enabled to hold possession of Jerusalem till the time of David (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 5:6, 7; 1 Chr. 11:5</reflink>).</description>
    <description>Several of the kings of Israel and Judah distinguished themselves as fortifiers or "builders" of cities.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Ferret">
    <description>Lev. 11:30 (R.V., "gecko"), one of the unclean creeping things. It was perhaps the Lacerta gecko which was intended by the Hebrew word (anakah, a cry, "mourning," the creature which groans) here used, i.e., the "fan-footed" lizard, the gecko which makes a mournful wail. The LXX. translate it by a word meaning "shrew-mouse," of which there are three species in Palestine. The Rabbinical writers regard it as the hedgehog. The translation of the Revised Version is to be preferred.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Ferry boat">
    <description>(<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 19:18</reflink>), some kind of boat for crossing the river which the men of Judah placed at the service of the king. Floats or rafts for this purpose were in use from remote times (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 18:2</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Festivals, Religious">
    <description>There were daily (Lev. 23), weekly, monthly, and yearly festivals, and great stress was laid on the regular observance of them in every particular (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 28:1-8; Ex. 29:38-42; Lev. 6:8-23; Ex. 30:7-9; 27:20</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(1.) The septenary festivals were,</description>
    <description>(a) The weekly Sabbath (<reflink target="XXX">Lev. 23:1-3; Ex. 19:3-30; 20:8-11; 31:12, etc.</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(b) The seventh new moon, or the feast of Trumpets (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 28:11-15; 29:1-6</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(c) The Sabbatical year (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 23:10, 11; Lev. 25:2-7</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(d) The year of jubilee (Lev. 23-35; 25: 8-16; 27:16-25).</description>
    <description>(2.) The great feasts were,</description>
    <description>(a) The Passover. (b) The feast of Pentecost, or of weeks. (c) The feast of Tabernacles, or of ingathering.</description>
    <description>On each of these occasions every male Israelite was commanded "to appear before the Lord" (<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 27:7; Neh. 8:9-12</reflink>). The attendance of women was voluntary. (<reflink target="XXX">Comp. Luke 2:41; 1 Sam. 1:7; 2:19.</reflink>) The promise that God would protect their homes (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 34:23, 24</reflink>) while all the males were absent in Jerusalem at these feasts was always fulfilled. "During the whole period between Moses and Christ we never read of an enemy invading the land at the time of the three festivals. The first instance on record is thirty-three years after they had withdrawn from themselves the divine protection by imbruing their hands in the Saviour's blood, when Cestius, the Roman general, slew fifty of the people of Lydda while all the rest had gone up to the feast of Tabernacles, A.D. 66."</description>
    <description>These festivals, besides their religious purpose, had an important bearing on the maintenance among the people of the feeling of a national unity. The times fixed for their observance were arranged so as to interfere as little as possible with the industry of the people. The Passover was kept just before the harvest commenced, Pentecost at the conclusion of the corn harvest and before the vintage, the feast of Tabernacles after all the fruits of the ground had been gathered in.</description>
    <description>(3.) The Day of Atonement, the tenth day of the seventh month (<reflink target="XXX">Lev. 16:1, 34; 23:26-32; Num. 29:7-11</reflink>). (See ATONEMENT, DAY OF</description>
    <description>Of the post-Exilian festivals reference is made to the feast of Dedication (<reflink target="XXX">John 10:22</reflink>). This feast was appointed by Judas Maccabaeus in commemoration of the purification of the temple after it had been polluted by Antiochus Epiphanes. The "feast of Purim" (q.v.), Esther 9:24-32, was also instituted after the Exile. (<reflink target="XXX">Cf. John 5:1.</reflink>)</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Festus, Porcius">
    <description>the successor of Felix (A.D. 60) as procurator of Judea (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 24:27</reflink>). A few weeks after he had entered on his office the case of Paul, then a prisoner at Caesarea, was reported to him. The "next day," after he had gone down to Caesarea, he heard Paul defend himself in the presence of Herod Agrippa II. and his sister Bernice, and not finding in him anything worthy of death or of bonds, would have set him free had he not appealed unto Caesar (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 25:11, 12</reflink>). In consequence of this appeal Paul was sent to Rome. Festus, after being in office less than two years, died in Judea. (<see target="x-self">See AGRIPPA.</see>)</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Fever">
    <description>(<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 28:22; Matt. 8:14; Mark 1:30; John 4:52; Acts 28:8</reflink>), a burning heat, as the word so rendered denotes, which attends all febrile attacks. In all Eastern countries such diseases are very common. Peter's wife's mother is said to have suffered from a "great fever" (<reflink target="XXX">Luke 4:38</reflink>), an instance of Luke's professional exactitude in describing disease. He adopts here the technical medical distinction, as in those times fevers were divided into the "great" and the "less."</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Field">
    <description>(Heb. sadeh), a cultivated field, but unenclosed. It is applied to any cultivated ground or pasture (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 29:2; 31:4; 34:7</reflink>), or tillage (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 37:7; 47:24</reflink>). It is also applied to woodland (<reflink target="XXX">Ps. 132:6</reflink>) or mountain top (<reflink target="XXX">Judg. 9:32, 36; 2 Sam. 1:21</reflink>). It denotes sometimes a cultivated region as opposed to the wilderness (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 33:19; 36:35</reflink>). Unwalled villages or scattered houses are spoken of as "in the fields" (<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 28:3, 16; Lev. 25:31; Mark 6:36, 56</reflink>). The "open field" is a place remote from a house (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 4:8; Lev. 14:7, 53; 17:5</reflink>). Cultivated land of any extent was called a field (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 23:13, 17; 41:8; Lev. 27:16; Ruth 4:5; Neh. 12:29</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Fig">
    <description>First mentioned in Gen. 3:7. The fig-tree is mentioned (<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 8:8</reflink>) as one of the valuable products of Palestine. It was a sign of peace and prosperity (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 4:25; Micah 4:4; Zech. 3:10</reflink>). Figs were used medicinally (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 20:7</reflink>), and pressed together and formed into "cakes" as articles of diet (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 30:12; Jer. 24:2</reflink>).</description>
    <description>Our Lord's cursing the fig-tree near Bethany (<reflink target="XXX">Mark 11:13</reflink>) has occasioned much perplexity from the circumstance, as mentioned by the evangelist, that "the time of figs was not yet." The explanation of the words, however, lies in the simple fact that the fruit of the fig-tree appears before the leaves, and hence that if the tree produced leaves it ought also to have had fruit. It ought to have had fruit if it had been true to its "pretensions," in showing its leaves at this particular season. "This tree, so to speak, vaunted itself to be in advance of all the other trees, challenged the passer-by that he should come and refresh himself with its fruit. Yet when the Lord accepted its challenge and drew near, it proved to be but as the others, without fruit as they; for indeed, as the evangelist observes, the time of figs had not yet arrived. Its fault, if one may use the word, lay in its pretensions, in its making a show to run before the rest when it did not so indeed" (Trench, Miracles).</description>
    <description>The fig-tree of Palestine (Ficus carica) produces two and sometimes three crops of figs in a year, (1) the bikkurah, or "early-ripe fig" (<reflink target="XXX">Micah 7:1; Isa. 28:4; Hos. 9:10, R.V.</reflink>), which is ripe about the end of June, dropping off as soon as it is ripe (<reflink target="XXX">Nah. 3:12</reflink>); (2) the kermus, or "summer fig," then begins to be formed, and is ripe about August; and (3) the pag (plural "green figs," Cant. 2:13; Gr. olynthos, Rev. 6:13, "the untimely fig"), or "winter fig," which ripens in sheltered spots in spring.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Fillets">
    <description>Heb. hashukum, plur., joinings (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 27:17; 38:17, 28</reflink>), the rods by which the tops of the columns around the tabernacle court were joined together, and from which the curtains were suspended (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 27:10, 11; 36:38</reflink>).</description>
    <description>In Jer. 52:21 the rendering of a different word, _hut_, meaning a "thread," and designating a measuring-line of 12 cubits in length for the circumference of the copper pillars of Solomon's temple.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Finer">
    <description>a worker in silver and gold (<reflink target="XXX">Prov. 25:4</reflink>). In Judg. 17:4 the word (tsoreph) is rendered "founder," and in Isa. 41:7 "goldsmith."</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Fining pot">
    <description>a crucible, melting-pot (<reflink target="XXX">Prov. 17:3; 27:21</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Fir">
    <description>the uniform rendering in the Authorized Version (marg. R.V., "cypress") of _berosh_ (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 6:5; 1 Kings 5:8, 10; 6:15, 34; 9:11, etc.</reflink>), a lofty tree (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 55:13</reflink>) growing on Lebanon (37:24). Its wood was used in making musical instruments and doors of houses, and for ceilings (<reflink target="XXX">2 Chr. 3:5</reflink>), the decks of ships (<reflink target="XXX">Ezek. 27:5</reflink>), floorings and spear-shafts (<reflink target="XXX">Nah. 2:3, R.V.</reflink>). The true fir (abies) is not found in Palestine, but the pine tree, of which there are four species, is common.</description>
    <description>The precise kind of tree meant by the "green fir tree" (<reflink target="XXX">Hos. 14:8</reflink>) is uncertain. Some regard it as the sherbin tree, a cypress resembling the cedar; others, the Aleppo or maritime pine (Pinus halepensis), which resembles the Scotch fir; while others think that the "stone-pine" (Pinus pinea) is probably meant. (<see target="x-self">See PINE.</see>)</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Fire">
    <description>(1.) For sacred purposes. The sacrifices were consumed by fire (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 8:20</reflink>). The ever-burning fire on the altar was first kindled from heaven (<reflink target="XXX">Lev. 6:9, 13; 9:24</reflink>), and afterwards rekindled at the dedication of Solomon's temple (<reflink target="XXX">2 Chr. 7:1, 3</reflink>). The expressions "fire from heaven" and "fire of the Lord" generally denote lightning, but sometimes also the fire of the altar was so called (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 29:18; Lev. 1:9; 2:3; 3:5, 9</reflink>).</description>
    <description>Fire for a sacred purpose obtained otherwise than from the altar was called "strange fire" (<reflink target="XXX">Lev. 10:1, 2; Num. 3:4</reflink>).</description>
    <description>The victims slain for sin offerings were afterwards consumed by fire outside the camp (<reflink target="XXX">Lev. 4:12, 21; 6:30; 16:27; Heb. 13:11</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(2.) For domestic purposes, such as baking, cooking, warmth, etc. (<reflink target="XXX">Jer. 36:22; Mark 14:54; John 18:18</reflink>). But on Sabbath no fire for any domestic purpose was to be kindled (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 35:3; Num. 15:32-36</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(3.) Punishment of death by fire was inflicted on such as were guilty of certain forms of unchastity and incest (<reflink target="XXX">Lev. 20:14; 21:9</reflink>). The burning of captives in war was not unknown among the Jews (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 12:31; Jer. 29:22</reflink>). The bodies of infamous persons who were executed were also sometimes burned (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 7:25; 2 Kings 23:16</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(4.) In war, fire was used in the destruction of cities, as Jericho (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 6:24</reflink>), Ai (8:19), Hazor (11:11), Laish (<reflink target="XXX">Judg. 18:27</reflink>), etc. The war-chariots of the Canaanites were burnt (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 11:6, 9, 13</reflink>). The Israelites burned the images (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 10:26; R.V., "pillars"</reflink>) of the house of Baal. These objects of worship seem to have been of the nature of obelisks, and were sometimes evidently made of wood.</description>
    <description>Torches were sometimes carried by the soldiers in battle (<reflink target="XXX">Judg. 7:16</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(5.) Figuratively, fire is a symbol of Jehovah's presence and the instrument of his power (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 14:19; Num. 11:1, 3; Judg. 13:20; 1 Kings 18:38; 2 Kings 1:10, 12; 2:11; Isa. 6:4; Ezek. 1:4; Rev. 1:14, etc.</reflink>).</description>
    <description>God's word is also likened unto fire (<reflink target="XXX">Jer. 23:29</reflink>). It is referred to as an emblem of severe trials or misfortunes (<reflink target="XXX">Zech. 12:6; Luke 12:49; 1 Cor. 3:13, 15; 1 Pet. 1:7</reflink>), and of eternal punishment (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 5:22; Mark 9:44; Rev. 14:10; 21:8</reflink>).</description>
    <description>The influence of the Holy Ghost is likened unto fire (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 3:11</reflink>). His descent was denoted by the appearance of tongues as of fire (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 2:3</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Firebrand">
    <description>Isa. 7:4, Amos 4:11, Zech. 3:2, denotes the burnt end of a stick (Heb. 'ud); in Judg. 15:4, a lamp or torch, a flambeau (Heb. lappid); in Prov. 26:18 (<reflink target="XXX">comp. Eph. 6:16</reflink>), burning darts or arrows (Heb. zikkim).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Firepan">
    <description>(<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 27:3; 38:3</reflink>), one of the vessels of the temple service (rendered "snuff-dish" Ex. 25:38; 37:23; and "censer" Lev. 10:1; 16:12). It was probably a metallic cinder-basin used for the purpose of carrying live coal for burning incense, and of carrying away the snuff in trimming the lamps.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Firkin">
    <description>Used only in John 2:6; the Attic amphora, equivalent to the Hebrew bath (q.v.), a measure for liquids containing about 8 7/8 gallons.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Firmament">
    <description>from the Vulgate firmamentum, which is used as the translation of the Hebrew _raki'a_. This word means simply "expansion." It denotes the space or expanse like an arch appearing immediately above us. They who rendered _raki'a_ by firmamentum regarded it as a solid body. The language of Scripture is not scientific but popular, and hence we read of the sun rising and setting, and also here the use of this particular word. It is plain that it was used to denote solidity as well as expansion. It formed a division between the waters above and the waters below (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 1:7</reflink>). The _raki'a_ supported the upper reservoir (<reflink target="XXX">Ps. 148:4</reflink>). It was the support also of the heavenly bodies (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 1:14</reflink>), and is spoken of as having "windows" and "doors" (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 7:11; Isa. 24:18; Mal. 3:10</reflink>) through which the rain and snow might descend.</description>

  <item id="First-born">
    <description>sons enjoyed certain special privileges (<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 21:17; Gen. 25:23, 31, 34; 49:3; 1 Chr. 5:1; Heb. 12:16; Ps. 89:27</reflink>). (<see target="x-self">See BIRTHRIGHT.</see>)</description>
    <description>The "first-born of the poor" signifies the most miserable of the poor (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 14:30</reflink>). The "church of the first-born" signifies the church of the redeemed.</description>
    <description>The destruction of the first-born was the last of the ten plagues inflicted on the Egyptians (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 11:1-8; 12:29, 30</reflink>).</description>
    <description>Menephtah is probably the Pharaoh whose first-born was slain. His son did not succeed or survive his father, but died early. The son's tomb has been found at Thebes unfinished, showing it was needed earlier than was expected. Some of the records on the tomb are as follows: "The son whom Menephtah loves; who draws towards him his father's heart, the singer, the prince of archers, who governed Egypt on behalf of his father. Dead."</description>

  <item id="First-born, Redemption of">
    <description>From the beginning the office of the priesthood in each family belonged to the eldest son. But when the extensive plan of sacrificial worship was introduced, requiring a company of men to be exclusively devoted to this ministry, the primitive office of the first-born was superseded by that of the Levites (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 3:11-13</reflink>), and it was ordained that the first-born of man and of unclean animals should henceforth be redeemed (18:15).</description>
    <description>The laws concerning this redemption of the first-born of man are recorded in Ex. 13:12-15; 22:29; 34:20; Num. 3:45; 8:17; 18:16; Lev. 12:2, 4.</description>
    <description>The first-born male of every clean animal was to be given up to the priest for sacrifice (<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 12:6; Ex. 13:12; 34:20; Num. 18:15-17</reflink>).</description>
    <description>But the first-born of unclean animals was either to be redeemed or sold and the price given to the priest (<reflink target="XXX">Lev. 27:11-13, 27</reflink>). The first-born of an ass, if not redeemed, was to be put to death (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 13:13; 34:20</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="First-born, Sanctification of the">
    <description>A peculiar sanctity was attached to the first-born both of man and of cattle. God claimed that the first-born males of man and of animals should be consecrated to him, the one as a priest (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 19:22, 24</reflink>), representing the family to which he belonged, and the other to be offered up in sacrifice (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 4:4</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="First-fruits">
    <description>The first-fruits of the ground were offered unto God just as the first-born of man and animals.</description>
    <description>The law required, (1.) That on the morrow after the Passover Sabbath a sheaf of new corn should be waved by the priest before the altar (<reflink target="XXX">Lev. 23:5, 6, 10, 12; 2:12</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(2.) That at the feast of Pentecost two loaves of leavened bread, made from the new flour, were to be waved in like manner (<reflink target="XXX">Lev. 23:15, 17; Num. 28:26</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(3.) The feast of Tabernacles was an acknowledgement that the fruits of the harvest were from the Lord (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 23:16; 34:22</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(4.) Every individual, besides, was required to consecrate to God a portion of the first-fruits of the land (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 22:29; 23:19; 34:26; Num. 15:20, 21</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(5.) The law enjoined that no fruit was to be gathered from newly-planted fruit-trees for the first three years, and that the first-fruits of the fourth year were to be consecrated to the Lord (<reflink target="XXX">Lev. 19:23-25</reflink>). Jeremiah (2:3) alludes to the ordinance of "first-fruits," and hence he must have been acquainted with the books of Exodus, Leviticus, and Numbers, where the laws regarding it are recorded.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Fish">
    <description>called _dag_ by the Hebrews, a word denoting great fecundity (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 9:2; Num. 11:22; Jonah 2:1, 10</reflink>). No fish is mentioned by name either in the Old or in the New Testament. Fish abounded in the Mediterranean and in the lakes of the Jordan, so that the Hebrews were no doubt acquainted with many species. Two of the villages on the shores of the Sea of Galilee derived their names from their fisheries, Bethsaida (the "house of fish") on the east and on the west. There is probably no other sheet of water in the world of equal dimensions that contains such a variety and profusion of fish. About thirty-seven different kinds have been found. Some of the fishes are of a European type, such as the roach, the barbel, and the blenny; others are markedly African and tropical, such as the eel-like silurus. There was a regular fish-market apparently in Jerusalem (<reflink target="XXX">2 Chr. 33:14; Neh. 3:3; 12:39; Zeph. 1:10</reflink>), as there was a fish-gate which was probably contiguous to it.</description>
    <description>Sidon is the oldest fishing establishment known in history.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Fish-hooks">
    <description>were used for catching fish (<reflink target="XXX">Amos 4:2; comp. Isa. 37:29; Jer. 16:16; Ezek. 29:4; Job. 41:1, 2; Matt. 17:27</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Fish-pools">
    <description>(<reflink target="XXX">Cant. 7:4</reflink>) should be simply "pools," as in the Revised Version. The reservoirs near Heshbon (q.v.) were probably stocked with fish (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 2:13; 4:12; Isa. 7:3; 22:9, 11</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Fisher">
    <description>Besides its literal sense (<reflink target="XXX">Luke 5:2</reflink>), this word is also applied by our Lord to his disciples in a figurative sense (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 4:19; Mark 1:17</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Fishing, the art of">
    <description>was prosecuted with great industry in the waters of Palestine. It was from the fishing-nets that Jesus called his disciples (<reflink target="XXX">Mark 1:16-20</reflink>), and it was in a fishing-boat he rebuked the winds and the waves (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 8:26</reflink>) and delivered that remarkable series of prophecies recorded in Matt. 13. He twice miraculously fed multitudes with fish and bread (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 14:19; 15:36</reflink>). It was in the mouth of a fish that the tribute-money was found (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 17:27</reflink>). And he "ate a piece of broiled fish" with his disciples after his resurrection (<reflink target="XXX">Luke 24:42, 43; comp. Acts 1:3</reflink>). At the Sea of Tiberias (<reflink target="XXX">John 21:1-14</reflink>), in obedience to his direction, the disciples cast their net "on the right side of the ship," and enclosed so many that "they were not able to draw it for the multitude of fishes."</description>
    <description>Two kinds of fishing-nets are mentioned in the New Testament:</description>
    <description>(1.) The casting-net (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 4:18; Mark 1:16</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(2.) The drag-net or seine (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 13:48</reflink>).</description>
    <description>Fish were also caught by the fishing-hook (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 17:27</reflink>). (<see target="x-self">See NET.</see>)</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Fitches">
    <description>(<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 28:25, 27</reflink>), the rendering of the Hebrew _ketsah_, "without doubt the Nigella sativa, a small annual of the order Ranunculacece, which grows wild in the Mediterranean countries, and is cultivated in Egypt and Syria for its seed." It is rendered in margin of the Revised Version "black cummin." The seeds are used as a condiment.</description>
    <description>In Ezek. 4:9 this word is the rendering of the Hebrew _kussemeth_ (incorrectly rendered "rye" in the Authorized Version of Ex. 9:32 and Isa. 28:25, but "spelt" in the Revised Version). The reading "fitches" here is an error; it should be "spelt."</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Flag">
    <description>(Heb., or rather Egyptian, ahu, Job 8:11), rendered "meadow" in Gen. 41:2, 18; probably the Cyperus esculentus, a species of rush eaten by cattle, the Nile reed. It also grows in Palestine.</description>
    <description>In Ex. 2:3, 5, Isa. 19:6, it is the rendering of the Hebrew _suph_, a word which occurs frequently in connection with _yam_; as _yam suph_, to denote the "Red Sea" (q.v.) or the sea of weeds (as this word is rendered, Jonah 2:5). It denotes some kind of sedge or reed which grows in marshy places. (<see target="x-self">See PAPER , REED.</see>)</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Flagon">
    <description>Heb. ashishah, (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 6:19; 1 Chr. 16:3; Cant. 2:5; Hos. 3:1</reflink>), meaning properly "a cake of pressed raisins." "Flagons of wine" of the Authorized Version should be, as in the Revised Version, "cakes of raisins" in all these passages. In Isa. 22:24 it is the rendering of the Hebrew _nebel_, which properly means a bottle or vessel of skin. (Comp. 1 Sam. 1:24; 10:3; 25:18; 2 Sam. 16:1, where the same Hebrew word is used.)</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Flame of fire">
    <description>is the chosen symbol of the holiness of God (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 3:2; Rev. 2:18</reflink>), as indicating "the intense, all-consuming operation of his holiness in relation to sin."</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Flax">
    <description>(Heb. pishtah, i.e., "peeled", in allusion to the fact that the stalks of flax when dried were first split or peeled before being steeped in water for the purpose of destroying the pulp). This plant was cultivated from earliest times. The flax of Egypt was destroyed by the plague of hail when it "was bolled", i.e., was forming pods for seed (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 9:31</reflink>). It was extensively cultivated both in Egypt and Palestine. Reference is made in Josh. 2:6 to the custom of drying flax-stalks by exposing them to the sun on the flat roofs of houses. It was much used in forming articles of clothing such as girdles, also cords and bands (<reflink target="XXX">Lev. 13:48, 52, 59; Deut. 22:11</reflink>). (<see target="x-self">See LINEN.</see>)</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Flea">
    <description>David at the cave of Adullam thus addressed his persecutor Saul (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 24:14</reflink>): "After whom is the king of Israel come out? after whom dost thou pursue? after a dead dog, after a flea?" He thus speaks of himself as the poor, contemptible object of the monarch's pursuit, a "worthy object truly for an expedition of the king of Israel with his picked troops!" This insect is in Eastern language the popular emblem of insignificance. In 1 Sam. 26:20 the LXX. read "come out to seek my life" instead of "to seek a flea."</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Fleece">
    <description>the wool of a sheep, whether shorn off or still attached to the skin (<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 18:4; Job 31:20</reflink>). The miracle of Gideon's fleece (<reflink target="XXX">Judg. 6:37-40</reflink>) consisted in the dew having fallen at one time on the fleece without any on the floor, and at another time in the fleece remaining dry while the ground was wet with dew.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Flesh">
    <description>in the Old Testament denotes (1) a particular part of the body of man and animals (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 2:21; 41:2; Ps. 102:5, marg.</reflink>); (2) the whole body (<reflink target="XXX">Ps. 16:9</reflink>); (3) all living things having flesh, and particularly humanity as a whole (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 6:12, 13</reflink>); (4) mutability and weakness (<reflink target="XXX">2 Chr. 32:8; comp. Isa. 31:3; Ps. 78:39</reflink>). As suggesting the idea of softness it is used in the expression "heart of flesh" (<reflink target="XXX">Ezek. 11:19</reflink>). The expression "my flesh and bone" (<reflink target="XXX">Judg. 9:2; Isa. 58:7</reflink>) denotes relationship.</description>
    <description>In the New Testament, besides these it is also used to denote the sinful element of human nature as opposed to the "Spirit" (<reflink target="XXX">Rom. 6:19; Matt. 16:17</reflink>). Being "in the flesh" means being unrenewed (<reflink target="XXX">Rom. 7:5; 8:8, 9</reflink>), and to live "according to the flesh" is to live and act sinfully (<reflink target="XXX">Rom. 8:4, 5, 7, 12</reflink>).</description>
    <description>This word also denotes the human nature of Christ (<reflink target="XXX">John 1:14, "The Word was made flesh." Comp. also 1 Tim. 3:16; Rom. 1:3</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Flesh-hook">
    <description>a many-pronged fork used in the sacrificial services (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 2:13, 14; Ex. 27:3; 38:3</reflink>) by the priest in drawing away the flesh. The fat of the sacrifice, together with the breast and shoulder (<reflink target="XXX">Lev. 7:29-34</reflink>), were presented by the worshipper to the priest. The fat was burned on the alter (3:3-5), and the breast and shoulder became the portion of the priests. But Hophni and Phinehas, not content with this, sent a servant to seize with a flesh-hook a further portion.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Flint">
    <description>abounds in all the plains and valleys of the wilderness of the forty years' wanderings. In Isa. 50:7 and Ezek. 3:9 the expressions, where the word is used, means that the "Messiah would be firm and resolute amidst all contempt and scorn which he would meet; that he had made up his mind to endure it, and would not shrink from any kind or degree of suffering which would be necessary to accomplish the great work in which he was engaged." (<reflink target="XXX">Comp. Ezek. 3:8, 9.</reflink>) The words "like a flint" are used with reference to the hoofs of horses (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 5:28</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Flood">
    <description>an event recorded in Gen. 7 and 8. (<see target="x-self">See DELUGE.</see>) In Josh. 24:2, 3, 14, 15, the word "flood" (R.V., "river") means the river Euphrates. In Ps. 66:6, this word refers to the river Jordan.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Flour">
    <description>Grain reduced to the form of meal is spoken of in the time of Abraham (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 18:6</reflink>). As baking was a daily necessity, grain was also ground daily at the mills (<reflink target="XXX">Jer. 25:10</reflink>). The flour mingled with water was kneaded in kneading-troughs, and sometimes leaven (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 12:34</reflink>) was added and sometimes omitted (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 19:3</reflink>). The dough was then formed into thin cakes nine or ten inches in diameter and baked in the oven.</description>
    <description>Fine flour was offered by the poor as a sin-offering (<reflink target="XXX">Lev. 5:11-13</reflink>), and also in connection with other sacrifices (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 15:3-12; 28:7-29</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Flowers">
    <description>Very few species of flowers are mentioned in the Bible although they abounded in Palestine. It has been calculated that in Western Syria and Palestine from two thousand to two thousand five hundred plants are found, of which about five hundred probably are British wild-flowers. Their beauty is often alluded to (<reflink target="XXX">Cant. 2:12; Matt. 6:28</reflink>). They are referred to as affording an emblem of the transitory nature of human life (<reflink target="XXX">Job 14:2; Ps. 103:15; Isa. 28:1; 40:6; James 1:10</reflink>). Gardens containing flowers and fragrant herbs are spoken of (<reflink target="XXX">Cant. 4:16; 6:2</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Flute">
    <description>a musical instrument, probably composed of a number of pipes, mentioned Dan. 3:5, 7, 10, 15.</description>
    <description>In Matt. 9:23, 24, notice is taken of players on the flute, here called "minstrels" (but in R.V. "flute-players").</description>
    <description>Flutes were in common use among the ancient Egyptians.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Fly">
    <description>Heb. zebub, (<reflink target="XXX">Eccl. 10:1; Isa. 7:18</reflink>). This fly was so grievous a pest that the Phoenicians invoked against it the aid of their god Baal-zebub (q.v.). The prophet Isaiah (7:18) alludes to some poisonous fly which was believed to be found on the confines of Egypt, and which would be called by the Lord. Poisonous flies exist in many parts of Africa, for instance, the different kinds of tsetse.</description>
    <description>Heb. 'arob, the name given to the insects sent as a plague on the land of Egypt (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 8:21-31; Ps. 78:45; 105:31</reflink>). The LXX. render this by a word which means the "dog-fly," the cynomuia. The Jewish commentators regarded the Hebrew word here as connected with the word _'arab_, which means "mingled;" and they accordingly supposed the plague to consist of a mixed multitude of animals, beasts, reptiles, and insects. But there is no doubt that "the _'arab_" denotes a single definite species. Some interpreters regard it as the Blatta orientalis, the cockroach, a species of beetle. These insects "inflict very painful bites with their jaws; gnaw and destroy clothes, household furniture, leather, and articles of every kind, and either consume or render unavailable all eatables."</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Foam">
    <description>(<reflink target="XXX">Hos. 10:7</reflink>), the rendering of _ketseph_, which properly means twigs or splinters (as rendered in the LXX. and marg. R.V.). The expression in Hosea may therefore be read, "as a chip on the face of the water," denoting the helplessness of the piece of wood as compared with the irresistable current.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Fodder">
    <description>Heb. belil, (<reflink target="XXX">Job 6:5</reflink>), meaning properly a mixture or medley (Lat. farrago), "made up of various kinds of grain, as wheat, barley, vetches, and the like, all mixed together, and then sown or given to cattle" (<reflink target="XXX">Job 24:6, A.V. "corn," R.V. "provender;" Isa. 30:24, provender"</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Fold">
    <description>an enclosure for flocks to rest together (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 13:20</reflink>). Sheep-folds are mentioned Num. 32:16, 24, 36; 2 Sam. 7:8; Zeph. 2:6; John 10:1, etc. It was prophesied of the cities of Ammon (<reflink target="XXX">Ezek. 25:5</reflink>), Aroer (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 17:2</reflink>), and Judaea, that they would be folds or couching-places for flocks. "Among the pots," of the Authorized Version (<reflink target="XXX">Ps. 68:13</reflink>), is rightly in the Revised Version, "among the sheepfolds."</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Food">
    <description>Originally the Creator granted the use of the vegetable world for food to man (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 1:29</reflink>), with the exception mentioned (2:17). The use of animal food was probably not unknown to the antediluvians. There is, however, a distinct law on the subject given to Noah after the Deluge (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 9:2-5</reflink>). Various articles of food used in the patriarchal age are mentioned in Gen. 18:6-8; 25:34; 27:3, 4; 43:11. Regarding the food of the Israelites in Egypt, see Ex. 16:3; Num. 11:5. In the wilderness their ordinary food was miraculously supplied in the manna. They had also quails (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 16:11-13; Num. 11:31</reflink>).</description>
    <description>In the law of Moses there are special regulations as to the animals to be used for food (Lev. 11; Deut. 14:3-21). The Jews were also forbidden to use as food anything that had been consecrated to idols (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 34:15</reflink>), or animals that had died of disease or had been torn by wild beasts (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 22:31; Lev. 22:8</reflink>). (<reflink target="XXX">See also for other restrictions Ex. 23:19; 29:13-22; Lev. 3:4-9; 9:18, 19; 22:8; Deut. 14:21.</reflink>) But beyond these restrictions they had a large grant from God (<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 14:26; 32:13, 14</reflink>).</description>
    <description>Food was prepared for use in various ways. The cereals were sometimes eaten without any preparation (<reflink target="XXX">Lev. 23:14; Deut. 23:25; 2 Kings 4:42</reflink>). Vegetables were cooked by boiling (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 25:30, 34; 2 Kings 4:38, 39</reflink>), and thus also other articles of food were prepared for use (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 27:4; Prov. 23:3; Ezek. 24:10; Luke 24:42; John 21:9</reflink>). Food was also prepared by roasting (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 12:8; Lev. 2:14</reflink>). (<see target="x-self">See COOK.</see>)</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Footstool">

The most extensive was the trans-Jordanic forest of Ephraim (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 18:6, 8; Josh. 17:15, 18</reflink>), which is probably the same as the wood of Ephratah (<reflink target="XXX">Ps. 132:6</reflink>), some part of the great forest of Gilead. It was in this forest that Absalom was slain by Joab. David withdrew to the forest of Hareth in the mountains of Judah to avoid the fury of Saul (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 22:5</reflink>). We read also of the forest of Bethel (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 2:23, 24</reflink>), and of that which the Israelites passed in their pursuit of the Philistines (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 14:25</reflink>), and of the forest of the cedars of Lebanon (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 4:33; 2 Kings 19:23; Hos. 14:5, 6</reflink>).</description>
    <description>"The house of the forest of Lebanon (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 7:2; 10:17; 2 Chr. 9:16</reflink>) was probably Solomon's armoury, and was so called because the wood of its many pillars came from Lebanon, and they had the appearance of a forest.

    <description>Heb. horesh, denoting a thicket of trees, underwood, jungle, bushes, or trees entangled, and therefore affording a safe hiding-place. place.

It is also rendered "wood", the "wood" in the "wilderness of Ziph," in which david concealed himself (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 23:15</reflink>), which lay south-east of Hebron. In Isa. 17:19 this word is in Authorized Version rendered incorrectly "bough."</description>
    <description>Heb. pardes, meaning an enclosed garden or plantation. Asaph is (<reflink target="XXX">Neh. 2:8</reflink>) called the "keeper of the king's forest." The same Hebrew word is used Eccl. 2:5, where it is rendered in the plural "orchards" (R.V., "parks"), and Cant. 4: 13, rendered "orchard" (R.V. marg., "a paradise").</description>
    <description>"The forest of the vintage" (<reflink target="XXX">Zech. 11:2, "inaccessible forest," or R.V. "strong forest"</reflink>) is probably a figurative allusion to Jerusalem, or the verse may simply point to the devastation of the region referred to.</description>

  <item id="Forgiveness of sin">
    <description>one of the constituent parts of justification. In pardoning sin, God absolves the sinner from the condemnation of the law, and that on account of the work of Christ, i.e., he removes the guilt of sin, or the sinner's actual liability to eternal wrath on account of it. All sins are forgiven freely (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 5:31; 13:38; 1 John 1:6-9</reflink>). The sinner is by this act of grace for ever freed from the guilt and penalty of his sins. This is the peculiar prerogative of God (<reflink target="XXX">Ps. 130:4; Mark 2:5</reflink>). It is offered to all in the gospel. (<see target="x-self">See JUSTIFICATION.</see>)</description>

  <item id="Fountain">
    <description>(Heb. 'ain; i.e., "eye" of the water desert), a natural source of living water. Palestine was a "land of brooks of water, of fountains, and depths that spring out of valleys and hills" (<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 8:7; 11:11</reflink>).</description>
    <description>These fountains, bright sparkling "eyes" of the desert, are remarkable for their abundance and their beauty, especially on the west of Jordan. All the perennial rivers and streams of the country are supplied from fountains, and depend comparatively little on surface water. "Palestine is a country of mountains and hills, and it abounds in fountains of water. The murmur of these waters is heard in every dell, and the luxuriant foliage which surrounds them is seen in every plain." Besides its rain-water, its cisterns and fountains, Jerusalem had also an abundant supply of water in the magnificent reservoir called "Solomon's Pools" (q.v.), at the head of the Urtas valley, whence it was conveyed to the city by subterrean channels some 10 miles in length. These have all been long ago destroyed, so that no water from the "Pools" now reaches Jerusalem. Only one fountain has been discovered at Jerusalem, the so-called "Virgins's Fountains," in the valley of Kidron; and only one well (Heb. beer), the Bir Eyub, also in the valley of Kidron, south of the King's Gardens, which has been dug through the solid rock. The inhabitants of Jerusalem are now mainly dependent on the winter rains, which they store in cisterns. (<see target="x-self">See WELL.</see>)</description>

  <item id="Fountain of the Virgin">
    <description>the perennial source from which the Pool of Siloam (q.v.) is supplied, the waters flowing in a copious stream to it through a tunnel cut through the rock, the actual length of which is 1,750 feet. The spring rises in a cave 20 feet by 7. A serpentine tunnel 67 feet long runs from it toward the left, off which the tunnel to the Pool of Siloam branches. It is the only unfailing fountain in Jerusalem.</description>
    <description>The fountain received its name from the "fantastic legend" that here the virgin washed the swaddling-clothes of our Lord.</description>
    <description>This spring has the singular characteristic of being intermittent, flowing from three to five times daily in winter, twice daily in summer, and only once daily in autumn. This peculiarity is accounted for by the supposition that the outlet from the reservoir is by a passage in the form of a siphon.</description>

Birds of all kinds abound in Palestine, and the capture of these for the table and for other uses formed the employment of many persons. The traps and snares used for this purpose are mentioned Hos. 5:1; Prov. 7:23; 22:5; Amos 3:5; Ps. 69:22; comp. Deut. 22:6, 7.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Fox">
    <description>(Heb. shu'al, a name derived from its digging or burrowing under ground), the Vulpes thaleb, or Syrian fox, the only species of this animal indigenous to Palestine. It burrows, is silent and solitary in its habits, is destructive to vineyards, being a plunderer of ripe grapes (<reflink target="XXX">Cant. 2:15</reflink>). The Vulpes Niloticus, or Egyptian dog-fox, and the Vulpes vulgaris, or common fox, are also found in Palestine.</description>
    <description>The proverbial cunning of the fox is alluded to in Ezek. 13:4, and in Luke 13:32, where our Lord calls Herod "that fox." In Judg. 15:4, 5, the reference is in all probability to the jackal. The Hebrew word _shu'al_ through the Persian _schagal_ becomes our jackal (Canis aureus), so that the word may bear that signification here. The reasons for preferring the rendering "jackal" are (1) that it is more easily caught than the fox; (2) that the fox is shy and suspicious, and flies mankind, while the jackal does not; and (3) that foxes are difficult, jackals comparatively easy, to treat in the way here described. Jackals hunt in large numbers, and are still very numerous in Southern Palestine.</description>

    <description>(Heb. lebonah; Gr. libanos, i.e., "white"), an odorous resin imported from Arabia (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 60:6; Jer. 6:20</reflink>), yet also growing in Palestine (<reflink target="XXX">Cant. 4:14</reflink>). It was one of the ingredients in the perfume of the sanctuary (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 30:34</reflink>), and was used as an accompaniment of the meat-offering (<reflink target="XXX">Lev. 2:1, 16; 6:15; 24:7</reflink>).

    <description>This frankincense, or olibanum, used by the Jews in the temple services is not to be confounded with the frankincense of modern commerce, which is an exudation of the Norway spruce fir, the Pinus abies. It was probably a resin from the Indian tree known to botanists by the name of Boswellia serrata or thurifera, which grows to the height of forty feet.</description>

    <description>In the New Testament this word occurs only in Rev. 16:13, where it is referred to as a symbol of uncleanness. The only species of frog existing in Palestine is the green frog (Rana esculenta), the well-known edible frog of the Continent.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Frontlets">
    <description>occurs only in Ex. 13:16; Deut. 6:8, and 11:18. The meaning of the injunction to the Israelites, with regard to the statues and precepts given them, that they should "bind them for a sign upon their hand, and have them as frontlets between their eyes," was that they should keep them distinctly in view and carefully attend to them. But soon after their return from Babylon they began to interpret this injunction literally, and had accordingly portions of the law written out and worn about their person. These they called tephillin, i.e., "prayers." The passages so written out on strips of parchment were these, Ex. 12:2-10; 13:11-21; Deut. 6:4-9; 11:18-21. They were then "rolled up in a case of black calfskin, which was attached to a stiffer piece of leather, having a thong one finger broad and one cubit and a half long. Those worn on the forehead were written on four strips of parchment, and put into four little cells within a square case, which had on it the Hebrew letter called shin, the three points of which were regarded as an emblem of God." This case tied around the forehead in a particular way was called "the tephillah on the head." (<see target="x-self">See PHYLACTERY.</see>)</description>

"At the present day frost is entirely unknown in the lower portions of the valley of the Jordan, but slight frosts are sometimes felt on the sea-coast and near Lebanon." Throughout Western Asia cold frosty nights are frequently succeeded by warm days.</description>
    <description>"Hoar frost" (Heb. kephor, so called from its covering the ground) is mentioned in Ex. 16:14; Job 38:29; Ps. 147:16.</description>
    <description>In Ps. 78:47 the word rendered "frost" (R.V. marg., "great hail-stones"), _hanamal_, occurs only there. It is rendered by Gesenius, the Hebrew lexicographer, "ant," and so also by others, but the usual interpretation derived from the ancient versions may be maintained.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Fruit">
    <description>a word as used in Scripture denoting produce in general, whether vegetable or animal. The Hebrews divided the fruits of the land into three classes:,</description>

    <description>(2.) The fruit of the vine, "vintage-fruit" (Heb. tirosh); grapes, whether moist or dried.</description>
    <description>(3.) "Orchard-fruits" (Heb. yitshar), as dates, figs, citrons, etc.</description>
    <description>Injunctions concerning offerings and tithes were expressed by these Hebrew terms alone (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 18:12; Deut. 14:23</reflink>). This word "fruit" is also used of children or offspring (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 30:2; Deut. 7:13; Luke 1:42; Ps. 21:10; 132:11</reflink>); also of the progeny of beasts (<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 28:51; Isa. 14:29</reflink>).</description>
    <description>It is used metaphorically in a variety of forms (<reflink target="XXX">Ps. 104:13; Prov. 1:31; 11:30; 31:16; Isa. 3:10; 10:12; Matt. 3:8; 21:41; 26:29; Heb. 13:15; Rom. 7:4, 5; 15:28</reflink>).</description>

    <description>The tribe of Gad during the march through the wilderness had their place with Simeon and Reuben on the south side of the tabernacle (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 2:14</reflink>). The tribes of Reuben and Gad continued all through their history to follow the pastoral pursuits of the patriarchs (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 32:1-5</reflink>).</description>
    <description>The portion allotted to the tribe of Gad was on the east of Jordan, and comprehended the half of Gilead, a region of great beauty and fertility (<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 3:12</reflink>), bounded on the east by the Arabian desert, on the west by the Jordan (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 13:27</reflink>), and on the north by the river Jabbok. It thus included the whole of the Jordan valley as far north as to the Sea of Galilee, where it narrowed almost to a point.</description>
    <description>This tribe was fierce and warlike; they were "strong men of might, men of war for the battle, that could handle shield and buckler, their faces the faces of lions, and like roes upon the mountains for swiftness" (<reflink target="XXX">1 Chr. 12:8; 5:19-22</reflink>). Barzillai (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 17:27</reflink>) and Elijah (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 17:1</reflink>) were of this tribe. It was carried into captivity at the same time as the other tribes of the northern kingdom by Tiglath-pileser (<reflink target="XXX">1 Chr. 5:26</reflink>), and in the time of Jeremiah (49:1) their cities were inhabited by the Ammonites.</description>

  <item id="Gadara">
    <description>the capital of the Roman province of Peraea. It stood on the summit of a mountain about 6 miles south-east of the Sea of Galilee. Mark (5:1) and Luke (8:26-39) describe the miracle of the healing of the demoniac (Matthew [8:28-34] says two demoniacs) as having been wrought "in the country of the Gadarenes," thus describing the scene generally. The miracle could not have been wrought at Gadara itself, for between the lake and this town there is the deep, almost impassable ravine of the Hieromax (Jarmuk). It is identified with the modern village of Um-Keis, which is surrounded by very extensive ruins, all bearing testimony to the splendour of ancient Gadara.</description>
    <description>"The most interesting remains of Gadara are its tombs, which dot the cliffs for a considerable distance round the city, chiefly on the north-east declivity; but many beautifully sculptured sarcophagi are scattered over the surrounding heights. They are excavated in the limestone rock, and consist of chambers of various dimensions, some more than 20 feet square, with recesses in the sides for bodies...The present inhabitants of Um-Keis are all troglodytes, 'dwelling in tombs,' like the poor maniacs of old, and occasionally they are almost as dangerous to unprotected travellers."</description>

  <item id="Galatia">
    <description>has been called the "Gallia" of the East, Roman writers calling its inhabitants Galli. They were an intermixture of Gauls and Greeks, and hence were called Gallo-Graeci, and the country Gallo-Graecia. The Galatians were in their origin a part of that great Celtic migration which invaded Macedonia about B.C. 280. They were invited by the king of Bithynia to cross over into Asia Minor to assist him in his wars. There they ultimately settled, and being strengthened by fresh accessions of the same clan from Europe, they overran Bithynia, and supported themselves by plundering neighbouring countries. They were great warriors, and hired themselves out as mercenary soldiers, sometimes fighting on both sides in the great battles of the times. They were at length brought under the power of Rome in B.C. 189, and Galatia became a Roman province B.C. 25.</description>
    <description>This province of Galatia, within the limits of which these Celtic tribes were confined, was the central region of Asia Minor.</description>
    <description>During his second missionary journey Paul, accompanied by Silas and Timothy (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 16:6</reflink>), visited the "region of Galatia," where he was detained by sickness (<reflink target="XXX">Gal. 4:13</reflink>), and had thus the longer opportunity of preaching to them the gospel. On his third journey he went over "all the country of Galatia and Phrygia in order" (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 18:23</reflink>). Crescens was sent thither by Paul toward the close of his life (<reflink target="XXX">2 Tim. 4:10</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Galatians, Epistle to">
    <description>The genuineness of this epistle is not called in question. Its Pauline origin is universally acknowledged.</description>
    <description>Occasion of. The churches of Galatia were founded by Paul himself (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 16:6; Gal. 1:8; 4:13, 19</reflink>). They seem to have been composed mainly of converts from heathenism (4:8), but partly also of Jewish converts, who probably, under the influence of Judaizing teachers, sought to incorporate the rites of Judaism with Christianity, and by their active zeal had succeeded in inducing the majority of the churches to adopt their views (1:6; 3:1). This epistle was written for the purpose of counteracting this Judaizing tendency, and of recalling the Galatians to the simplicity of the gospel, and at the same time also of vindicating Paul's claim to be a divinely-commissioned apostle.</description>
    <description>Time and place of writing. The epistle was probably written very soon after Paul's second visit to Galatia (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 18:23</reflink>). The references of the epistle appear to agree with this conclusion. The visit to Jerusalem, mentioned in Gal. 2:1-10, was identical with that of Acts 15, and it is spoken of as a thing of the past, and consequently the epistle was written subsequently to the council of Jerusalem. The similarity between this epistle and that to the Romans has led to the conclusion that they were both written at the same time, namely, in the winter of A.D. 57-8, during Paul's stay in Corinth (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 20:2, 3</reflink>). This to the Galatians is written on the urgency of the occasion, tidings having reached him of the state of matters; and that to the Romans in a more deliberate and systematic way, in exposition of the same great doctrines of the gospel.</description>
    <description>Contents of. The great question discussed is, Was the Jewish law binding on Christians? The epistle is designed to prove against the Jews that men are justified by faith without the works of the law of Moses. After an introductory address (<reflink target="XXX">Gal. 1:1-10</reflink>) the apostle discusses the subjects which had occasioned the epistle. (1) He defends his apostolic authority (1:11-19; 2:1-14); (2) shows the evil influence of the Judaizers in destroying the very essence of the gospel (3 and 4); (3) exhorts the Galatian believers to stand fast in the faith as it is in Jesus, and to abound in the fruits of the Spirit, and in a right use of their Christian freedom (5-6:1-10); (4) and then concludes with a summary of the topics discussed, and with the benediction.</description>
    <description>The Epistle to the Galatians and that to the Romans taken together "form a complete proof that justification is not to be obtained meritoriously either by works of morality or by rites and ceremonies, though of divine appointment; but that it is a free gift, proceeding entirely from the mercy of God, to those who receive it by faith in Jesus our Lord."</description>
    <description>In the conclusion of the epistle (6:11) Paul says, "Ye see how large a letter I have written with mine own hand." It is implied that this was different from his ordinary usage, which was simply to write the concluding salutation with his own hand, indicating that the rest of the epistle was written by another hand. Regarding this conclusion, Lightfoot, in his Commentary on the epistle, says: "At this point the apostle takes the pen from his amanuensis, and the concluding paragraph is written with his own hand. From the time when letters began to be forged in his name (<reflink target="XXX">2 Thess. 2:2; 3:17</reflink>) it seems to have been his practice to close with a few words in his own handwriting, as a precaution against such forgeries...In the present case he writes a whole paragraph, summing up the main lessons of the epistle in terse, eager, disjointed sentences. He writes it, too, in large, bold characters (Gr. pelikois grammasin), that his hand-writing may reflect the energy and determination of his soul."

  <item id="Galilean">
    <description>an inhabitant or native of Galilee. This word was used as a name of contempt as applied to our Lord's disciples (<reflink target="XXX">Luke 22:59; Acts 2:7</reflink>). All the apostles, with the exception of Judas Iscariot (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 1:11</reflink>), were Galileans. Peter was detected by his Galilean accent (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 26:69; Mark 14:70</reflink>).</description>
    <description>This was also one of the names of reproach given to the early Christians. Julian the Apostate, as he is called, not only used the epithet himself when referring to Christ and his apostles, but he made it a law that no one should ever call the Christians by any other name.</description>

  <item id="Galilee">
    <description>circuit. Solomon rewarded Hiram for certain services rendered him by the gift of an upland plain among the mountains of Naphtali. Hiram was dissatisfied with the gift, and called it "the land of Cabul" (q.v.). The Jews called it Galil. It continued long to be occupied by the original inhabitants, and hence came to be called "Galilee of the Gentiles" (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 4:15</reflink>), and also "Upper Galilee," to distinguish it from the extensive addition afterwards made to it toward the south, which was usually called "Lower Galilee." In the time of our Lord, Galilee embraced more than one-third of Western Palestine, extending "from Dan on the north, at the base of Mount Hermon, to the ridges of Carmel and Gilboa on the south, and from the Jordan valley on the east away across the splendid plains of Jezreel and Acre to the shores of the Mediterranean on the west." Palestine was divided into three provinces, Judea, Samaria, and Galilee, which comprehended the whole northern section of the country (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 9:31</reflink>), and was the largest of the three.</description>
    <description>It was the scene of some of the most memorable events of Jewish history. Galilee also was the home of our Lord during at least thirty years of his life. The first three Gospels are chiefly taken up with our Lord's public ministry in this province. "The entire province is encircled with a halo of holy associations connected with the life, works, and teachings of Jesus of Nazareth." "It is noteworthy that of his thirty-two beautiful parables, no less than ninteen were spoken in Galilee. And it is no less remarkable that of his entire thirty-three great miracles, twenty-five were wrought in this province. His first miracle was wrought at the wedding in Cana of Galilee, and his last, after his resurrection, on the shore of Galilee's sea. In Galilee our Lord delivered the Sermon on The Mount, and the discourses on 'The Bread of Life,' on 'Purity,' on 'Forgiveness,' and on 'Humility.' In Galilee he called his first disciples; and there occurred the sublime scene of the Transfiguration" (Porter's Through Samaria).</description>
    <description>When the Sanhedrin were about to proceed with some plan for the condemnation of our Lord (<reflink target="XXX">John 7:45-52</reflink>), Nicodemus interposed in his behalf. (<reflink target="XXX">Comp. Deut. 1:16,17; 17:8.</reflink>) They replied, "Art thou also of Galilee?.... Out of Galilee ariseth no prophet." This saying of theirs was "not historically true, for two prophets at least had arisen from Galilee, Jonah of Gath-hepher, and the greatest of all the prophets, Elijah of Thisbe, and perhaps also Nahum and Hosea. Their contempt for Galilee made them lose sight of historical accuracy" (Alford, Com.).</description>
    <description>The Galilean accent differed from that of Jerusalem in being broader and more guttural (<reflink target="XXX">Mark 14:70</reflink>).</description>

  <item id="Galilee, Sea of">
    <description>(<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 4:18; 15:29</reflink>), is mentioned in the Bible under three other names. (1.) In the Old Testament it is called the "sea of Chinnereth" (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 34:11; Josh. 12:3; 13:27</reflink>), as is supposed from its harp-like shape. (2). The "lake of Gennesareth" once by Luke (5:1), from the flat district lying on its west coast. (3.) John (6:1; 21:1) calls it the "sea of Tiberias" (q.v.). The modern Arabs retain this name, Bahr Tabariyeh.</description>
    <description>This lake is 12 1/2 miles long, and from 4 to 7 1/2 broad. Its surface is 682 feet below the level of the Mediterranean. Its depth is from 80 to 160 feet. The Jordan enters it 10 1/2 miles below the southern extremity of the Huleh Lake, or about 26 1/2 miles from its source. In this distance of 26 1/2 miles there is a fall in the river of 1,682 feet, or of more than 60 feet to the mile. It is 27 miles east of the Mediterranean, and about 60 miles north-east of Jerusalem. It is of an oval shape, and abounds in fish.</description>
    <description>Its present appearance is thus described: "The utter loneliness and absolute stillness of the scene are exceedingly impressive. It seems as if all nature had gone to rest, languishing under the scorching heat. How different it was in the days of our Lord! Then all was life and bustle along the shores; the cities and villages that thickly studded them resounded with the hum of a busy population; while from hill-side and corn-field came the cheerful cry of shepherd and ploughman. The lake, too, was dotted with dark fishing-boats and spangled with white sails. Now a mournful, solitary silence reigns over sea and shore. The cities are in ruins!"</description>
    <description>This sea is chiefly of interest as associated with the public ministry of our Lord. Capernaum, "his own city" (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 9:1</reflink>), stood on its shores. From among the fishermen who plied their calling on its waters he chose Peter and his brother Andrew, and James and John, to be disciples, and sent them forth to be "fishers of men" (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 4:18,22; Mark 1:16-20; Luke 5: 1-11</reflink>). He stilled its tempest, saying to the storm that swept over it, "Peace, be still" (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 8:23-27; Mark 7:31-35</reflink>); and here also he showed himself after his resurrection to his disciples (John 21).</description>
    <description>"The Sea of Galilee is indeed the cradle of the gospel. The subterranean fires of nature prepared a lake basin, through which a river afterwards ran, keeping its waters always fresh. In this basin a vast quantity of shell-fish swarmed, and multiplied to such an extent that they formed the food of an extraordinary profusion of fish. The great variety and abundance of the fish in the lake attracted to its shores a larger and more varied population than existed elsewhere in Palestine, whereby this secluded district was brought into contact with all parts of the world. And this large and varied population, with access to all nations and countries, attracted the Lord Jesus, and induced him to make this spot the centre of his public ministry."</description>

  <item id="Gall">
    <description>(1) Heb. mererah, meaning "bitterness" (<reflink target="XXX">Job 16:13</reflink>); i.e., the bile secreted in the liver. This word is also used of the poison of asps (20:14), and of the vitals, the seat of life (25).</description>
    <description>(2.) Heb. rosh. In Deut. 32:33 and Job 20:16 it denotes the poison of serpents. In Hos. 10:4 the Hebrew word is rendered "hemlock." The original probably denotes some bitter, poisonous plant, most probably the poppy, which grows up quickly, and is therefore coupled with wormwood (<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 29:18; Jer. 9:15; Lam. 3:19</reflink>). Comp. Jer. 8:14; 23:15, "water of gall," Gesenius, "poppy juice;" others, "water of hemlock," "bitter water."</description>
    <description>(3.) Gr. chole (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 27:34</reflink>), the LXX. translation of the Hebrew _rosh_ in Ps. 69; 21, which foretells our Lord's sufferings. The drink offered to our Lord was vinegar (made of light wine rendered acid, the common drink of Roman soldiers) "mingled with gall," or, according to Mark (15:23), "mingled with myrrh;" both expressions meaning the same thing, namely, that the vinegar was made bitter by the infusion of wormwood or some other bitter substance, usually given, according to a merciful custom, as an anodyne to those who were crucified, to render them insensible to pain. Our Lord, knowing this, refuses to drink it. He would take nothing to cloud his faculties or blunt the pain of dying. He chooses to suffer every element of woe in the bitter cup of agony given him by the Father (<reflink target="XXX">John 18:11</reflink>).</description>

He was "deputy", i.e., proconsul, as in Revised Version, of Achaia, under the emperor Claudius, when Paul visited Corinth (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 18:12</reflink>). The word used here by Luke in describing the rank of Gallio shows his accuracy. Achaia was a senatorial province under Claudius, and the governor of such a province was called a "proconsul." He is spoken of by his contemporaries as "sweet Gallio," and is described as a most popular and affectionate man. When the Jews brought Paul before his tribunal on the charge of persuading "men to worship God contrary to the law" (18:13), he refused to listen to them, and "drave them from the judgment seat" (18:16).</description>

  <item id="Gallows">
    <description>Heb. 'ets, meaning "a tree" (<reflink target="XXX">Esther 6:4</reflink>), a post or gibbet. In Gen. 40:19 and Deut. 21:22 the word is rendered "tree."</description>

    <description>(2.) The son of rabbi Simeon, and grandson of the famous rabbi Hillel. He was a Pharisse, and therefore the opponent of the party of the Sadducees. He was noted for his learning, and was president of the Sanhedrim during the regins of Tiberius, Caligula, and Claudius, and died, it is said, about eighteen years before the destruction of Jerusalem.</description>
    <description>When the apostles were brought before the council, charged with preaching the resurrection of Jesus, as a zealous Pharisee Gamaliel councelled moderation and calmness. By a reference to well-known events, he advised them to "refrain from these men." If their work or counsel was of man, it would come to nothing; but if it was of God, they could not destroy it, and therefore ought to be on their guard lest they should be "found fighting against God" (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 5:34-40</reflink>).

    <description>(2.) Public games, such as were common among the Greeks and Romans, were foreign to the Jewish institutions and customs. Reference, however, is made to such games in two passages (<reflink target="XXX">Ps. 19:5; Eccl. 9:11</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(3.) Among the Greeks and Romans games entered largely into their social life.</description>
    <description>(a) Reference in the New Testament is made to gladiatorial shows and fights with wild beasts (<reflink target="XXX">1 Cor. 15:32</reflink>). These were common among the Romans, and sometimes on a large scale.</description>

  <item id="Garlands">
    <description>(<reflink target="XXX">Acts 14:13</reflink>). In heathen sacrifices the victims were adorned with fillets and garlands made of wool, with leaves and flowers interwoven. The altar and the priests and attendants were also in like manner adorned.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Garlic">
    <description>(Heb. shum, from its strong odour), mentioned only once (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 11:5</reflink>). The garlic common in Eastern countries is the Allium sativum or Allium Ascalonicum, so called from its having been brought into Europe from Ascalon by the Crusaders. It is now known by the name of "shallot" or "eschalot."</description>

  <item id="Garner">
    <description>(1.) Heb. 'otsar, a treasure; a store of goods laid up, and hence also the place where they are deposited (<reflink target="XXX">Joel 1:17; 2 Chr. 32:27, rendered "treasury"</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(2.) Heb. mezev, a cell, storeroom (<reflink target="XXX">Ps. 144:13</reflink>); Gr. apotheke, a place for storing anything, a granary (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 3:12; Luke 3:17</reflink>).</description>

  </item>
  <item id="Garrison">
    <description>(1.) Heb. matstsab, a station; a place where one stands (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 14:12</reflink>); a military or fortified post (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 13:23; 14:1, 4, 6, etc.</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(2.) Heb. netsib, a prefect, superintendent; hence a military post (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 10:5; 13:3, 4; 2 Sam. 8:6</reflink>). This word has also been explained to denote a pillar set up to mark the Philistine conquest, or an officer appointed to collect taxes; but the idea of a military post seems to be the correct one.</description>
    <description>(3.) Heb. matstsebah, properly a monumental column; improperly rendered pl. "garrisons" in Ezek. 26:11; correctly in Revised Version "pillars," marg. "obelisks," probably an idolatrous image.</description>

  <item id="Gate">
    <description>(1.) Of cities, as of Jerusalem (<reflink target="XXX">Jer. 37:13; Neh. 1:3; 2:3; 3:3</reflink>), of Sodom (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 19:1</reflink>), of Gaza (<reflink target="XXX">Judg. 16:3</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(2.) Of royal palaces (<reflink target="XXX">Neh. 2:8</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(3.) Of the temple of Solomon (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 6:34, 35; 2 Kings 18:16</reflink>); of the holy place (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 6:31, 32; Ezek. 41:23, 24</reflink>); of the outer courts of the temple, the beautiful gate (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 3:2</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(4.) Tombs (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 27:60</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(5.) Prisons (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 12:10; 16:27</reflink>).</description>

    <description>(7.) Camps (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 32:26, 27; Heb. 13:12</reflink>).</description>
    <description>The materials of which gates were made were,</description>
    <description>(1.) Iron and brass (<reflink target="XXX">Ps. 107:16; Isa. 45:2; Acts 12:10</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(2.) Stones and pearls (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 54:12; Rev. 21:21</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(3.) Wood (<reflink target="XXX">Judg. 16:3</reflink>) probably.</description>
    <description>At the gates of cities courts of justice were frequently held, and hence "judges of the gate" are spoken of (<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 16:18; 17:8; 21:19; 25:6, 7, etc.</reflink>). At the gates prophets also frequently delivered their messages (<reflink target="XXX">Prov. 1:21; 8:3; Isa. 29:21; Jer. 17:19, 20; 26:10</reflink>). Criminals were punished without the gates (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 21:13; Acts 7:59</reflink>). By the "gates of righteousness" we are probably to understand those of the temple (<reflink target="XXX">Ps. 118:19</reflink>). "The gates of hell" (R.V., "gates of Hades") Matt. 16:18, are generally interpreted as meaning the power of Satan, but probably they may mean the power of death, denoting that the Church of Christ shall never die.</description>

  <item id="Gath">
    <description>a wine-vat, one of the five royal cities of the Philistines (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 13:3</reflink>) on which the ark brought calamity (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 5:8, 9; 6:17</reflink>). It was famous also as being the birthplace or residence of Goliath (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 17:4</reflink>). David fled from Saul to Achish, king of Gath (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 21:10; 27:2-4; Ps. 56</reflink>), and his connection with it will account for the words in 2 Sam. 1:20. It was afterwards conquered by David (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 8:1</reflink>). It occupied a strong position on the borders of Judah and Philistia (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 21:10; 1 Chr. 18:1</reflink>). Its site has been identified with the hill called Tell esSafieh, the Alba Specula of the Middle Ages, which rises 695 feet above the plain on its east edge. It is noticed on monuments about B.C. 1500. (<see target="x-self">See METHEGAMMAH.</see>)</description>

  <item id="Gath-hepher">
    <description>wine-press of the well, a town of Lower Galilee, about 5 miles from Nazareth; the birthplace of Jonah (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 14:25</reflink>); the same as Gittah-hepher (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 19:13</reflink>). It has been identified with the modern el-Meshed, a village on the top of a rocky hill. Here the supposed tomb of Jonah, Neby Yunas, is still pointed out.</description>

  <item id="Gath-rimmon">
    <description>press of the pomegranate. (1.) A Levitical city in the tribe of Dan (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 19:45; 21:24; 1 Chr. 6:69</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(2.) Another city of the same name in Manasseh, west of the Jordan (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 21:25</reflink>), called also Bileam (<reflink target="XXX">1 Chr. 6:70</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Gaulanitis">
    <description>a name derived from "Golan" (q.v.), one of the cities of refuge in the territory of Manasseh (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 20:8; 21:27; Deut. 4:43</reflink>). This was one of the provinces ruled by Herod Antipas. It lay to the east of the Lake of Galilee, and included among its towns Bethsaida-Julias (<reflink target="XXX">Mark 8:22</reflink>) and Seleucia.</description>

  <item id="Gaza">
    <description>called also Azzah, which is its Hebrew name (<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 2:23; 1 Kings 4:24; Jer. 25:20</reflink>), strong, a city on the Mediterranean shore, remarkable for its early importance as the chief centre of a great commercial traffic with Egypt. It is one of the oldest cities of the world (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 10:19; Josh. 15:47</reflink>). Its earliest inhabitants were the Avims, who were conquered and displaced by the Caphtorims (<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 2:23; Josh. 13:2, 3</reflink>), a Philistine tribe. In the division of the land it fell to the lot of Judah (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 15:47; Judg. 1:18</reflink>). It was the southernmost of the five great Philistine cities which gave each a golden emerod as a trespass-offering unto the Lord (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 6:17</reflink>). Its gates were carried away by Samson (<reflink target="XXX">Judg. 16:1-3</reflink>). Here he was afterwards a prisoner, and "did grind in the prison house." Here he also pulled down the temple of Dagon, and slew "all the lords of the Philistines," himself also perishing in the ruin (<reflink target="XXX">Judg. 16:21-30</reflink>). The prophets denounce the judgments of God against it (<reflink target="XXX">Jer. 25:20; 47:5; Amos 1:6, 7; Zeph. 2:4</reflink>). It is referred to in Acts 8:26. Philip is here told to take the road from Jerusalem to Gaza (about 6 miles south-west of Jerusalem), "which is desert", i.e., the "desert road," probably by Hebron, through the desert hills of Southern Judea. (<see target="x-self">See SAMSON.</see>)</description>
    <description>It is noticed on monuments as early as B.C. 1600. Its small port is now called el-Mineh.</description>

    <description>the hill, (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 5:25 [1 Chr. 14:16, "Gibeon"]; 2 Kings 23:8; Neh. 11:31</reflink>), a Levitical city of Benjamin (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 15:22; 1 Sam. 13:16; 14:5, wrongly "Gibeah" in the A.V.</reflink>), on the north border of Judah near Gibeah (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 10:29; Josh. 18:24, 28</reflink>). "From Geba to Beersheba" expressed the whole extent of the kingdom of Judah, just as "from Dan to Beersheba" described the whole length of Palestine (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 23:8</reflink>). It has been identified with Gaba (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 18:24; Ezra 2:26; Neh. 7:30</reflink>), now Jeb'a, about 5 1/2 miles north of Jerusalem.</description>

  <item id="Gedaliah">
    <description>made great by Jehovah. (1.) the son of Jeduthum (<reflink target="XXX">1 Chr. 25:3, 9</reflink>). (2.) The grandfather of the prophet Zephaniah, and the father of Cushi (<reflink target="XXX">Zeph. 1:1</reflink>). (3.) One of the Jewish nobles who conspired against Jeremiah (<reflink target="XXX">Jer. 38:1</reflink>). (4.) The son of Ahikam, and grandson of Shaphan, secretary of king Josiah (<reflink target="XXX">Jer. 26:24</reflink>). After the destruction of Jerusalem (<see target="x-self">see ZEDEKIAH</see>), Nebuchadnezzar left him to govern the country as tributary to him (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 25:22; Jer. 40:5; 52:16</reflink>). Ishmael, however, at the head of a party of the royal family, "Jewish irreconcilables", rose against him, and slew him and "all the Jews that were with him" (<reflink target="XXX">Jer. 41:2, 3</reflink>) at Mizpah about three months after the destruction of Jerusalem. He and his band also plundered the town of Mizpah, and carried off many captives. He was, however, overtaken by Johanan and routed. He fled with such of his followers as escaped to the Ammonites (41:15). The little remnant of the Jews now fled to Egypt.</description>

  <item id="Geder">
    <description>a walled place, (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 12:13</reflink>), perhaps the same as Gederah or Gedor (15:58).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Gederah">
    <description>the fortress; a fortified place, a town in the plain (shephelah) of Judah (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 15:36</reflink>). This is a very common Canaanite and Phoenician name. It is the feminine form of Geder (12:13); the plural form is Gederoth (15:41). This place has by some been identified with Jedireh, a ruin 9 miles from Lydda, toward Eleutheropolis, and 4 miles north of Sur'ah (Zorah), in the valley of Elah.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Gederathite">
    <description>an epithet applied to Josabad, one of David's warriors at Ziklag (<reflink target="XXX">1 Chr. 12:4</reflink>), a native of Gederah.</description>

    <description>a wall. (1.) A city in the mountains or hill country of Judah (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 15:58</reflink>), identified with Jedar, between Jerusalem and Hebron.</description>
    <description>(2.) 1 Chr. 4:39, the Gederah of Josh. 15:36, or the well-known Gerar, as the LXX. read, where the patriarchs of old had sojourned and fed their flocks (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 20:1, 14, 15; 26:1, 6, 14</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(3.) A town apparently in Benjamin (<reflink target="XXX">1 Chr. 12:7</reflink>), the same probably as Geder (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 12:13</reflink>).</description>

  <item id="Gehazi">
    <description>valley of vision, Elisha's trusted servant (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 4:31; 5:25; 8:4, 5</reflink>). He appears in connection with the history of the Shunammite (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 4:14, 31</reflink>) and of Naaman the Syrian. On this latter occasion he was guilty of duplicity and dishonesty of conduct, causing Elisha to denounce his crime with righteous sternness, and pass on him the terrible doom that the leprosy of Naaman would cleave to him and his for ever (5:20-27).</description>
    <description>He afterwards appeared before king Joram, to whom he recounted the great deeds of his master (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 8:1-6</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Gehenna">
    <description>(originally Ge bene Hinnom; i.e., "the valley of the sons of Hinnom"), a deep, narrow glen to the south of Jerusalem, where the idolatrous Jews offered their children in sacrifice to Molech (<reflink target="XXX">2 Chr. 28:3; 33:6; Jer. 7:31; 19:2-6</reflink>). This valley afterwards became the common receptacle for all the refuse of the city. Here the dead bodies of animals and of criminals, and all kinds of filth, were cast and consumed by fire kept always burning. It thus in process of time became the image of the place of everlasting destruction. In this sense it is used by our Lord in Matt. 5:22, 29, 30; 10:28; 18:9; 23:15, 33; Mark 9:43, 45, 47; Luke 12:5. In these passages, and also in James 3:6, the word is uniformly rendered "hell," the Revised Version placing "Gehenna" in the margin. (See HELL; HINNOM</description>

  <item id="Geliloth">
    <description>circles; regions, a place in the border of Benjamin (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 18:17</reflink>); called Gilgal in 15:7.</description>

  <item id="Gemariah">
    <description>Jehovah has made perfect. (1.) The son of Shaphan, and one of the Levites of the temple in the time of Jehoiakim (<reflink target="XXX">Jer. 36:10; 2 Kings 22:12</reflink>). Baruch read aloud to the people from Gemariah's chamber, and again in the hearing of Gemariah and other scribes, the prophecies of Jeremiah (<reflink target="XXX">Jer. 36:11-20</reflink>), which filled him with terror. He joined with others in entreating the king not to destroy the roll of the prophecies which Baruch had read (21-25).</description>
    <description>(2.) The son of Hilkiah, who accompanied Shaphan with the tribute-money from Zedekiah to Nebuchadnezzar, and was the bearer at the same time of a letter from Jeremiah to the Jewish captives at Babylon (<reflink target="XXX">Jer. 29:3, 4</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Generation">
    <description>Gen. 2:4, "These are the generations," means the "history." 5:1, "The book of the generations," means a family register, or history of Adam. 37:2, "The generations of Jacob" = the history of Jacob and his descendants. 7:1, "In this generation" = in this age. Ps. 49:19, "The generation of his fathers" = the dwelling of his fathers, i.e., the grave. Ps. 73:15, "The generation of thy children" = the contemporary race. Isa. 53:8, "Who shall declare his generation?" = His manner of life who shall declare? or rather = His race, posterity, shall be so numerous that no one shall be able to declare it.</description>
    <description>In Matt. 1:17, the word means a succession or series of persons from the same stock. Matt. 3:7, "Generation of vipers" = brood of vipers. 24:34, "This generation" = the persons then living contemporary with Christ. 1 Pet. 2:9, "A chosen generation" = a chosen people.</description>
    <description>The Hebrews seem to have reckoned time by the generation. In the time of Abraham a generation was an hundred years, thus: Gen. 15:16, "In the fourth generation" = in four hundred years (comp. verse 13 and Ex. 12:40). In Deut. 1:35 and 2:14 a generation is a period of thirty-eight years.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Genesis">
    <description>The five books of Moses were collectively called the Pentateuch, a word of Greek origin meaning "the five-fold book." The Jews called them the Torah, i.e., "the law." It is probable that the division of the Torah into five books proceeded from the Greek translators of the Old Testament. The names by which these several books are generally known are Greek.</description>
    <description>The first book of the Pentateuch (q.v.) is called by the Jews Bereshith, i.e., "in the beginning", because this is the first word of the book. It is generally known among Christians by the name of Genesis, i.e., "creation" or "generation," being the name given to it in the LXX. as designating its character, because it gives an account of the origin of all things. It contains, according to the usual computation, the history of about two thousand three hundred and sixty-nine years.</description>
    <description>Genesis is divided into two principal parts. The first part (1-11) gives a general history of mankind down to the time of the Dispersion. The second part presents the early history of Israel down to the death and burial of Joseph (12-50).</description>
    <description>There are five principal persons brought in succession under our notice in this book, and around these persons the history of the successive periods is grouped, viz., Adam (1-3), Noah (4-9), Abraham (10-25:18), Isaac (25:19-35:29), and Jacob (36-50).</description>
    <description>In this book we have several prophecies concerning Christ (3:15; 12:3; 18:18; 22:18; 26:4; 28:14; 49:10). The author of this book was Moses. Under divine guidance he may indeed have been led to make use of materials already existing in primeval documents, or even of traditions in a trustworthy form that had come down to his time, purifying them from all that was unworthy; but the hand of Moses is clearly seen throughout in its composition.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Gennesaret">
    <description>a garden of riches. (1.) A town of Naphtali, called Chinnereth (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 19:35</reflink>), sometimes in the plural form Chinneroth (11:2). In later times the name was gradually changed to Genezar and Gennesaret (<reflink target="XXX">Luke 5:1</reflink>). This city stood on the western shore of the lake to which it gave its name. No trace of it remains. The plain of Gennesaret has been called, from its fertility and beauty, "the Paradise of Galilee." It is now called el-Ghuweir.</description>
    <description>(2.) The Lake of Gennesaret, the Grecized form of CHINNERETH (q.v.). (<see target="x-self">See GALILEE, SEA OF.</see>)</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Gentiles">
    <description>(Heb., usually in plural, goyim), meaning in general all nations except the Jews. In course of time, as the Jews began more and more to pride themselves on their peculiar privileges, it acquired unpleasant associations, and was used as a term of contempt.</description>
    <description>In the New Testament the Greek word Hellenes, meaning literally Greek (<reflink target="XXX">as in Acts 16:1, 3; 18:17; Rom. 1:14</reflink>), generally denotes any non-Jewish nation.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Genubath">
    <description>theft, the son of Hadad, of the Edomitish royal family. He was brought up in Pharaoh's household. His mother was a sister of Tahpenes, the king of Egypt's wife, mentioned in 1 Kings 11:20.</description>

  <item id="Gera">
    <description>grain. (1.) The son of Bela and grandson of Benjamin (<reflink target="XXX">1 Chr. 8:3, 5,7</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(2.) The father of Ehud the judge (<reflink target="XXX">Judg. 3:15</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(3.) The father of Shimei, who so grossly abused David (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 16:5; 19:16, 18</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Gerah">
    <description>a bean, probably of the carob tree, the smallest weight, and also the smallest piece of money, among the Hebrews, equal to the twentieth part of a shekel (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 30:13; Lev. 27:25; Num. 3:47</reflink>). This word came into use in the same way as our word "grain," from a grain of wheat.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Gerar">
    <description>a region; lodging-place, a very ancient town and district in the south border of Palestine, which was ruled over by a king named Abimelech (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 10:19; 20:1, 2</reflink>). Abraham sojourned here, and perhaps Isaac was born in this place. Both of these patriarchs were guilty of the sin of here denying their wives, and both of them entered into a treaty with the king before they departed to Beersheba (21:23-34; 26). It seems to have been a rich pastoral country (<reflink target="XXX">2 Chr. 14:12-18</reflink>). Isaac here reaped an hundred-fold, and was blessed of God (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 26:12</reflink>). The "valley of Gerar" (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 26:17</reflink>) was probably the modern Wady el-Jerdr.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Gergesa">
    <description>=Gerasa, identified with the modern Khersa, "over against Galilee," close to the lake. This was probably the scene of the miracle, Mark 5:1-20, etc. "From the base of the great plateau of Bashan, 2,000 feet or more overhead, the ground slopes down steeply, in places precipitously, to the shore. And at the foot of the declivity a bold spur runs out to the water's edge. By it the frantic swine would rush on headlong into the lake and perish." Porter's Through Samaria. (<see target="x-self">See GADARA.</see>)</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Gerizim">
    <description>a mountain of Samaria, about 3,000 feet above the Mediterranean. It was on the left of the valley containing the ancient town of Shechem (q.v.), on the way to Jerusalem. It stood over against Mount Ebal, the summits of these mountains being distant from each other about 2 miles (Deut. 27; Josh. 8:30-35). On the slopes of this mountain the tribes descended from the handmaids of Leah and Rachel, together with the tribe of Reuben, were gathered together, and gave the responses to the blessing pronounced as the reward of obedience, when Joshua in the valley below read the whole law in the hearing of all the people; as those gathered on Ebal responded with a loud Amen to the rehearsal of the curses pronounced on the disobedient. It was probably at this time that the coffin containing the embalmed body of Joseph was laid in the "parcel of ground which Jacob bought of the sons of Hamor" (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 33:19; 50:25</reflink>).</description>
    <description>Josephus relates (<reflink target="XXX">Ant. 11:8, 2-4</reflink>) that Sanballat built a temple for the Samaritans on this mountain, and instituted a priesthood, as rivals to those of the Jews at Jerusalem. This temple was destroyed after it had stood two hundred years. It was afterwards rebuilt by Herod the Great. There is a Samaritan tradition that it was the scene of the incident recorded in Gen. 22. There are many ruins on this mountain, some of which are evidently of Christian buildings. To this mountain the woman of Sychar referred in John 4:20. For centuries Gerizim was the centre of political outbreaks. The Samaritans (q.v.), a small but united body, still linger here, and keep up their ancient ceremonial worship.</description>

    <description>expulsion. (1.) The eldest son of Levi (<reflink target="XXX">1 Chr. 6:16, 17, 20, 43, 62, 71; 15:7</reflink>)=GERSHON (q.v.).</description>
    <description>(2.) The elder of the two sons of Moses born to him in Midian (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 2:22; 18:3</reflink>). On his way to Egypt with his family, in obedience to the command of the Lord, Moses was attacked by a sudden and dangerous illness (4:24-26), which Zipporah his wife believed to have been sent because he had neglected to circumcise his son. She accordingly took a "sharp stone" and circumcised her son Gershom, saying, "Surely a bloody husband art thou to me", i.e., by the blood of her child she had, as it were, purchased her husband, had won him back again.</description>
    <description>(3.) A descendant of Phinehas who returned with Ezra from Babylon (<reflink target="XXX">Ezra 8:2</reflink>).</description>

    <description>In the wilderness the sons of Gershon had charge of the fabrics of the tabernacle when it was moved from place to place, the curtains, veils, tent-hangings (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 3: 21-26</reflink>).

  <item id="Geshem">
    <description>or Gashmu, firmness, probably chief of the Arabs south of Palestine, one of the enemies of the Jews after the return from Babylon (<reflink target="XXX">Neh. 2:19; 6:1, 2</reflink>). He united with Sanballat and Tobiah in opposing the rebuilding of the wall of Jerusalem.</description>

  <item id="Geshur">
    <description>bridge, the name of a district or principality of Syria near Gilead, between Mount Hermon and the Lake of Tiberias (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 15:8; 1 Chr. 2:23</reflink>). The Geshurites probably inhabited the rocky fastness of Argob, the modern Lejah, in the north-east corner of Bashan. In the time of David it was ruled by Talmai, whose daughter he married, and who was the mother of Absalom, who fled to Geshur after the murder of Amnon (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 13:37</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Geshurites">
    <description>(1.) The inhabitants of Geshur. They maintained friendly relations with the Israelites on the east of Jordan (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 12:5; 13:11, 13</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(2.) Another aboriginal people of Palestine who inhabited the south-west border of the land. Geshuri in Josh. 13:2 should be "the Geshurite," not the Geshurites mentioned in ver. 11, 13, but the tribe mentioned in 1 Sam. 27:8.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Gethsemane">
    <description>oil-press, the name of an olive-yard at the foot of the Mount of Olives, to which Jesus was wont to retire (<reflink target="XXX">Luke 22:39</reflink>) with his disciples, and which is specially memorable as being the scene of his agony (<reflink target="XXX">Mark 14:32; John 18:1; Luke 22:44</reflink>). The plot of ground pointed out as Gethsemane is now surrounded by a wall, and is laid out as a modern European flower-garden. It contains eight venerable olive-trees, the age of which cannot, however, be determined. The exact site of Gethsemane is still in question. Dr. Thomson (The Land and the Book) says: "When I first came to Jerusalem, and for many years afterward, this plot of ground was open to all whenever they chose to come and meditate beneath its very old olivetrees. The Latins, however, have within the last few years succeeded in gaining sole possession, and have built a high wall around it...The Greeks have invented another site a little to the north of it...My own impression is that both are wrong. The position is too near the city, and so close to what must have always been the great thoroughfare eastward, that our Lord would scarcely have selected it for retirement on that dangerous and dismal night...I am inclined to place the garden in the secluded vale several hundred yards to the north-east of the present Gethsemane."</description>

  <item id="Gezer">
    <description>a precipice, an ancient royal Canaanitish city (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 10:33; 12:12</reflink>). It was allotted with its suburbs to the Kohathite Levites (21:21; 1 Chr. 6:67). It stood between the lower Beth-horon and the sea (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 16:3; 1 Kings 9:17</reflink>). It was the last point to which David pursued the Philistines (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 5:25; 1 Chr. 14:16</reflink>) after the battle of Baal-perazim. The Canaanites retained possession of it till the time of Solomon, when the king of Egypt took it and gave it to Solomon as a part of the dowry of the Egyptian princess whom he married (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 9:15-17</reflink>). It is identified with Tell el-Jezer, about 10 miles south-west of Beth-horon. It is mentioned in the Amarna tablets.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Ghost">
    <description>an old Saxon word equivalent to soul or spirit. It is the translation of the Hebrew _nephesh_ and the Greek _pneuma_, both meaning "breath," "life," "spirit," the "living principle" (<reflink target="XXX">Job 11:20; Jer. 15:9; Matt. 27:50; John 19:30</reflink>). The expression "to give up the ghost" means to die (<reflink target="XXX">Lam. 1:19; Gen. 25:17; 35:29; 49:33; Job 3:11</reflink>). (<see target="x-self">See HOLY GHOST.</see>)</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Giants">
    <description>(1.) Heb. nephilim, meaning "violent" or "causing to fall" (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 6:4</reflink>). These were the violent tyrants of those days, those who fell upon others. The word may also be derived from a root signifying "wonder," and hence "monsters" or "prodigies." In Num. 13:33 this name is given to a Canaanitish tribe, a race of large stature, "the sons of Anak." The Revised Version, in these passages, simply transliterates the original, and reads "Nephilim."</description>
    <description>(2.) Heb. rephaim, a race of giants (<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 3:11</reflink>) who lived on the east of Jordan, from whom Og was descended. They were probably the original inhabitants of the land before the immigration of the Canaanites. They were conquered by Chedorlaomer (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 14:5</reflink>), and their territories were promised as a possession to Abraham (15:20). The Anakim, Zuzim, and Emim were branches of this stock.</description>
    <description>In Job 26:5 (R.V., "they that are deceased;" marg., "the shades," the "Rephaim") and Isa. 14:9 this Hebrew word is rendered (A.V.) "dead." It means here "the shades," the departed spirits in Sheol. In Sam. 21:16, 18, 20, 33, "the giant" is (A.V.) the rendering of the singular form _ha raphah_, which may possibly be the name of the father of the four giants referred to here, or of the founder of the Rephaim. The Vulgate here reads "Arapha," whence Milton (in Samson Agonistes) has borrowed the name "Harapha." (<see target="x-self">See also 1 Chron. 20:5, 6, 8; Deut. 2:11, 20; 3:13; Josh. 15:8, etc., where the word is similarly rendered "giant."</see>) It is rendered "dead" in (A.V.) Ps. 88:10; Prov. 2:18; 9:18; 21:16: in all these places the Revised Version marg. has "the shades." (<reflink target="XXX">See also Isa. 26:14.</reflink>)</description>
    <description>(3.) Heb. 'Anakim (<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 2:10, 11, 21; Josh. 11:21, 22; 14:12, 15; called "sons of Anak," Num. 13:33; "children of Anak," 13:22; Josh. 15:14</reflink>), a nomad race of giants descended from Arba (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 14:15</reflink>), the father of Anak, that dwelt in the south of Palestine near Hebron (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 23:2; Josh. 15:13</reflink>). They were a Cushite tribe of the same race as the Philistines and the Egyptian shepherd kings. David on several occasions encountered them (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 21:15-22</reflink>). From this race sprung Goliath (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 17:4</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(4.) Heb. 'emin, a warlike tribe of the ancient Canaanites. They were "great, and many, and tall, as the Anakims" (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 14:5; Deut. 2:10, 11</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(5.) Heb. Zamzummim (q.v.), Deut. 2:20 so called by the Amorites.</description>
    <description>(6.) Heb. gibbor (<reflink target="XXX">Job 16:14</reflink>), a mighty one, i.e., a champion or hero. In its plural form (gibborim) it is rendered "mighty men" (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 23:8-39; 1 Kings 1:8; 1 Chr. 11:9-47; 29:24.</reflink>) The band of six hundred whom David gathered around him when he was a fugitive were so designated. They were divided into three divisions of two hundred each, and thirty divisions of twenty each. The captians of the thirty divisions were called "the thirty," the captains of the two hundred "the three," and the captain over the whole was called "chief among the captains" (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 23:8</reflink>). The sons born of the marriages mentioned in Gen. 6:4 are also called by this Hebrew name.</description>

  <item id="Gibbethon">
    <description>a height, a city of the Philistines in the territory of Dan, given to the Kohathites (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 19:44; 21:23</reflink>). Nadab the king of Israel, while besieging it, was slain under its walls by Baasha, one of his own officers (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 15:27</reflink>). It was in the possession of the Philistines after the secession of the ten tribes (<reflink target="XXX">2 Chr. 11:13, 14</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Gibeah">
    <description>a hill or hill-town, "of Benjamin" (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 13:15</reflink>), better known as "Gibeah of Saul" (11:4; Isa. 10:29). It was here that the terrible outrage was committed on the Levite's concubine which led to the almost utter extirpation of the tribe of Benjamin (Judg. 19; 20), only six hundred men surviving after a succession of disastrous battles. This was the birthplace of Saul, and continued to be his residence after he became king (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 10:26; 11:4; 15:34</reflink>). It was reckoned among the ancient sanctuaries of Palestine (10:26; 15:34; 23:19; 26:1; 2 Sam. 21:6-10), and hence it is called "Gibeah of God" (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 10:5, R.V. marg.</reflink>). It has been identified with the modern Tell el-Ful (i.e., "hill of the bean"), about 3 miles north of Jerusalem.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Gibeah of Judah">
    <description>(<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 15:57</reflink>), a city in the mountains of Judah, the modern Jeba, on a hill in the Wady Musurr, about 7 1/2 miles west-south-west of Bethlehem.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Gibeah of Phinehas">
    <description>(<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 15:57, R.V. marg.</reflink>), a city on Mount Ephraim which had been given to Phinehas (24:33 "hill," A.V.; R.V. marg. and Heb., "Gibeah."). Here Eleazar the son of Aaron was buried. It has been identified with the modern Khurbet Jibia, 5 miles north of Guphna towards Shechem.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Gibeah-haaraloth">
    <description>(<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 5:3, marg.</reflink>), hill of the foreskins, a place at Gilgal where those who had been born in the wilderness were circumcised. All the others, i.e., those who were under twenty years old at the time of the sentence at Kadesh, had already been circumcised.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Gibeon">
    <description>hill-city, "one of the royal cities, greater than Ai, and all the men thereof were mighty" (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 10:2</reflink>). Its inhabitants were Hivites (11:19). It lay within the territory of Benjamin, and became a priest-city (18:25; 21:17). Here the tabernacle was set up after the destruction of Nob, and here it remained many years till the temple was built by Solomon. It is represented by the modern el-Jib, to the south-west of Ai, and about 5 1/2 miles north-north-west of Jerusalem.</description>
    <description>A deputation of the Gibeonites, with their allies from three other cities (Josh. 9;17), visited the camp at Gilgal, and by false representations induced Joshua to enter into a league with them, although the Israelites had been specially warned against any league with the inhabitants of Canaan (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 23:32; 34:12; Num. 33:55; Deut. 7:2</reflink>). The deception practised on Joshua was detected three days later; but the oath rashly sworn "by Jehovah God of Israel" was kept, and the lives of the Gibeonites were spared. They were, however, made "bondmen" to the sanctuary (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 9:23</reflink>).</description>
    <description>The most remarkable incident connected with this city was the victory Joshua gained over the kings of Palestine (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 10:16-27</reflink>). The battle here fought has been regarded as "one of the most important in the history of the world." The kings of southern Canaan entered into a confederacy against Gibeon (because it had entered into a league with Joshua) under the leadership of Adoni-zedec, king of Jerusalem, and marched upon Gibeon with the view of taking possession of it. The Gibeonites entreated Joshua to come to their aid with the utmost speed. His army came suddenly upon that of the Amorite kings as it lay encamped before the city. It was completely routed, and only broken remnants of their great host found refuge in the fenced cities. The five confederate kings who led the army were taken prisoners, and put to death at Makkedah (q.v.). This eventful battle of Beth-horon sealed the fate of all the cities of Southern Palestine. Among the Amarna tablets is a letter from Adoni-zedec (q.v.) to the king of Egypt, written probably at Makkedah after the defeat, showing that the kings contemplated flight into Egypt.</description>
    <description>This place is again brought into notice as the scene of a battle between the army of Ish-bosheth under Abner and that of David led by Joab. At the suggestion of Abner, to spare the effusion of blood twelve men on either side were chosen to decide the battle. The issue was unexpected; for each of the men slew his fellow, and thus they all perished. The two armies then engaged in battle, in which Abner and his host were routed and put to flight (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 2:12-17</reflink>). This battle led to a virtual truce between Judah and Israel, Judah, under David, increasing in power; and Israel, under Ish-bosheth, continually losing ground.</description>
    <description>Soon after the death of Absalom and David's restoration to his throne his kingdom was visited by a grievous famine, which was found to be a punishment for Saul's violation (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 21:2, 5</reflink>) of the covenant with the Gibeonites (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 9:3-27</reflink>). The Gibeonites demanded blood for the wrong that had been done to them, and accordingly David gave up to them the two sons of Rizpah (q.v.) and the five sons of Michal, and these the Gibeonites took and hanged or crucified "in the hill before the Lord" (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 21:9</reflink>); and there the bodies hung for six months (21:10), and all the while Rizpah watched over the blackening corpses and "suffered neither the birds of the air to rest on them by day, nor the beasts of the field by night." David afterwards removed the bones of Saul and Jonathan at Jabeshgilead (21:12, 13).</description>
    <description>Here, "at the great stone," Amasa was put to death by Joab (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 20:5-10</reflink>). To the altar of burnt-offering which was at Gibeon, Joab (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 2:28-34</reflink>), who had taken the side of Adonijah, fled for sanctuary in the beginning of Solomon's reign, and was there also slain by the hand of Benaiah.</description>
    <description>Soon after he came to the throne, Solomon paid a visit of state to Gibeon, there to offer sacrifices (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 3:4; 2 Chr. 1:3</reflink>). On this occasion the Lord appeared to him in a memorable dream, recorded in 1 Kings 3:5-15; 2 Chr. 1:7-12. When the temple was built "all the men of Israel assembled themselves" to king Solomon, and brought up from Gibeon the tabernacle and "all the holy vessels that were in the tabernacle" to Jerusalem, where they remained till they were carried away by Nebuchadnezzar (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 24:13</reflink>).</description>

  <item id="Gideon">
    <description>called also Jerubbaal (<reflink target="XXX">Judg. 6:29, 32</reflink>), was the first of the judges whose history is circumstantially narrated (Judg. 6-8). His calling is the commencement of the second period in the history of the judges. After the victory gained by Deborah and Barak over Jabin, Israel once more sank into idolatry, and the Midianites (q.v.) and Amalekites, with other "children of the east," crossed the Jordan each year for seven successive years for the purpose of plundering and desolating the land. Gideon received a direct call from God to undertake the task of delivering the land from these warlike invaders. He was of the family of Abiezer (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 17:2; 1 Chr. 7:18</reflink>), and of the little township of Ophrah (<reflink target="XXX">Judg. 6:11</reflink>). First, with ten of his servants, he overthrew the altars of Baal and cut down the asherah which was upon it, and then blew the trumpet of alarm, and the people flocked to his standard on the crest of Mount Gilboa to the number of twenty-two thousand men. These were, however, reduced to only three hundred. These, strangely armed with torches and pitchers and trumpets, rushed in from three different points on the camp of Midian at midnight, in the valley to the north of Moreh, with the terrible war-cry, "For the Lord and for Gideon" (<reflink target="XXX">Judg. 7:18, R.V.</reflink>). Terror-stricken, the Midianites were put into dire confusion, and in the darkness slew one another, so that only fifteen thousand out of the great army of one hundred and twenty thousand escaped alive. The memory of this great deliverance impressed itself deeply on the mind of the nation (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 12:11; Ps. 83:11; Isa. 9:4; 10:26; Heb. 11:32</reflink>). The land had now rest for forty years. Gideon died in a good old age, and was buried in the sepulchre of his fathers. Soon after his death a change came over the people. They again forgot Jehovah, and turned to the worship of Baalim, "neither shewed they kindness to the house of Jerubbaal" (<reflink target="XXX">Judg. 8:35</reflink>). Gideon left behind him seventy sons, a feeble, sadly degenerated race, with one exception, that of Abimelech, who seems to have had much of the courage and energy of his father, yet of restless and unscrupulous ambition. He gathered around him a band who slaughtered all Gideon's sons, except Jotham, upon one stone. (<see target="x-self">See OPHRAH.</see>)</description>

  <item id="Gier eagle">
    <description>Heb. raham = "parental affection," Lev. 11:18; Deut. 14:17; R.V., "vulture"), a species of vulture living entirely on carrion. "It is about the size of a raven; has an almost triangular, bald, and wrinkled head, a strong pointed beak, black at the tip, large eyes and ears, the latter entirely on the outside, and long feet." It is common in Egypt, where it is popularly called "Pharaoh's chicken" (the Neophron percnopterus), and is found in Palestine only during summer. Tristram thinks that the Hebrew name, which is derived from a root meaning "to love," is given to it from the fact that the male and female bird never part company.</description>

  <item id="Gift">
    <description>(1.) An gratuity (<reflink target="XXX">Prov. 19:6</reflink>) to secure favour (18:16; 21:14), a thank-offering (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 18:11</reflink>), or a dowry (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 34:12</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(2.) An oblation or proppitatory gift (<reflink target="XXX">2Sa 8:2,6; 1Ch 18:2,6; 2Ch 26:8; Ps. 45:12; 72:10</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(3.) A bribe to a judge to obtain a favourable verdict (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 23:8; Deut. 16:19</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(4.) Simply a thing given (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 7:11; Luke 11:13; Eph. 4:8</reflink>); sacrifical (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 5:23, 24; 8:4</reflink>); eleemosynary (<reflink target="XXX">Luke 21:1</reflink>); a gratuity (<reflink target="XXX">John 4:10; Acts 8:20</reflink>). In Acts 2:38 the generic word dorea is rendered "gift." It differs from the charisma (<reflink target="XXX">1 Cor. 12:4</reflink>) as denoting not miraculous powers but the working of a new spirit in men, and that spirit from God.</description>
    <description>The giving of presents entered largely into the affairs of common life in the East. The nature of the presents was as various as were the occasions: food (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 9:7; 16:20</reflink>), sheep and cattle (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 32:13-15</reflink>), gold (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 18:11</reflink>), jewels (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 24:53</reflink>), furniture, and vessels for eating and drinking (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 17:28</reflink>); delicacies, as spices, honey, etc. (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 10:25; 2 Kings 5: 22</reflink>). The mode of presentation was with as much parade as possible: the presents were conveyed by the hands of servants (<reflink target="XXX">Judg. 3:18</reflink>), or still better, on the backs of beasts of burden (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 8:9</reflink>). The refusal of a present was regarded as a high indignity; and this constituted the aggravated insult noticed in Matt. 22:11, the marriage robe having been offered and refused.</description>

  <item id="Gifts, spiritual">
    <description>(Gr. charismata), gifts supernaturally bestowed on the early Christians, each having his own proper gift or gifts for the edification of the body of Christ. These were the result of the extraordinary operation of the Spirit, as on the day of Pentecost. They were the gifts of speaking with tongues, casting out devils, healing, etc. (<reflink target="XXX">Mark 16:17, 18</reflink>), usually communicated by the medium of the laying on of the hands of the apostles (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 8:17; 19:6; 1 Tim. 4:14</reflink>). These charismata were enjoyed only for a time. They could not continue always in the Church. They were suited to its infancy and to the necessities of those times.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Gihon">
    <description>a stream. (1.) One of the four rivers of Eden (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 2:13</reflink>). It has been identified with the Nile. Others regard it as the Oxus, or the Araxes, or the Ganges. But as, according to the sacred narrative, all these rivers of Eden took their origin from the head-waters of the Euphrates and the Trigris, it is probable that the Gihon is the ancient Araxes, which, under the modern name of the Arras, discharges itself into the Caspian Sea. It was the Asiatic and not the African "Cush" which the Gihon compassed (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 10:7-10</reflink>). (<see target="x-self">See EDEN.</see>)</description>
    <description>(2.) The only natural spring of water in or near Jerusalem is the "Fountain of the Virgin" (q.v.), which rises outside the city walls on the west bank of the Kidron valley. On the occasion of the approach of the Assyrian army under Sennacherib, Hezekiah, in order to prevent the besiegers from finding water, "stopped the upper water course of Gihon, and brought it straight down to the west side of the city of David" (<reflink target="XXX">2 Chr. 32:30; 33:14</reflink>). This "fountain" or spring is therefore to be regarded as the "upper water course of Gihon." From this "fountain" a tunnel cut through the ridge which forms the south part of the temple hill conveys the water to the Pool of Siloam, which lies on the opposite side of this ridge at the head of the Tyropoeon ("cheesemakers'") valley, or valley of the son of Hinnom, now filled up by rubbish. The length of this tunnel is about 1,750 feet. In 1880 an inscription was accidentally discovered on the wall of the tunnel about nineteen feet from where it opens into the Pool of Siloam. This inscription was executed in all probability by Hezekiah's workmen. It briefly narrates the history of the excavation. It may, however, be possible that this tunnel was executed in the time of Solomon. If the "waters of Shiloah that go softly" (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 8:6</reflink>) refers to the gentle stream that still flows through the tunnel into the Pool of Siloam, then this excavation must have existed before the time of Hezekiah.</description>
    <description>In the upper part of the Tyropoeoan valley there are two pools still existing, the first, called Birket el-Mamilla, to the west of the Jaffa gate; the second, to the south of the first, called Birket es-Sultan. It is the opinion of some that the former was the "upper" and the latter the "lower" Pool of Gihon (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 18:17; Isa. 7:3; 36:2; 22:9</reflink>).

  <item id="Gilboa">
    <description>boiling spring, a mountain range, now Jebel Fukua', memorable as the scene of Saul's disastrous defeat by the Philistines. Here also his three sons were slain, and he himself died by his own hand (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 28:4; 31:1-8; 2 Sam. 1:6-21; 21:12; 1 Chr. 10:1, 8</reflink>). It was a low barren range of mountains bounding the valley of Esdraelon (Jezreel) on the east, between it and the Jordan valley. When the tidings of this defeat were conveyed to David, he gave utterance to those pathetic words in the "Song of the Bow" (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 1:19-27</reflink>).</description>

  <item id="Gilead">
    <description>hill of testimony, (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 31:21</reflink>), a mountainous region east of Jordan. From its mountainous character it is called "the mount of Gilead" (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 31:25</reflink>). It is called also "the land of Gilead" (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 32:1</reflink>), and sometimes simply "Gilead" (<reflink target="XXX">Ps. 60:7; Gen. 37:25</reflink>). It comprised the possessions of the tribes of Gad and Reuben and the south part of Manasseh (<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 3:13; Num. 32:40</reflink>). It was bounded on the north by Bashan, and on the south by Moab and Ammon (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 31:21; Deut. 3:12-17</reflink>). "Half Gilead" was possessed by Sihon, and the other half, separated from it by the river Jabbok, by Og, king of Bashan. The deep ravine of the river Hieromax (the modern Sheriat el-Mandhur) separated Bashan from Gilead, which was about 60 miles in length and 20 in breadth, extending from near the south end of the Lake of Gennesaret to the north end of the Dead Sea. Abarim, Pisgah, Nebo, and Peor are its mountains mentioned in Scripture.</description>

  <item id="Gilead, Balm of">
    <description>The region of Gilead abounded in spices and aromatic gums, which were exported to Egypt and Tyre (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 37:25; Jer. 8:22; 46:11; Ezek. 27:17</reflink>). The word "balm" is a contracted form of "balsam," a word derived from the Greek _balsamon_, which was adopted as the representative of the Hebrew words _baal shemen_, meaning "lord" or "chief of oils."</description>
    <description>The Hebrew name of this balm was _tsori_. The tree yielding this medicinal oil was probably the Balsamodendron opobalsamum of botanists, and the Amyris opobalsamum of Linnaeus. It is an evergreen, rising to the height of about 14 feet. The oil or resin, exuding through an orifice made in its bark in very small quantities, is esteemed of great value for its supposed medicinal qualities. (<see target="x-self">See BALM.</see>) It may be noted that Coverdale's version reads in Jer. 8:22, "There is no triacle in Galaad." The word "triacle" = "treacle" is used in the sense of ointment.</description>

  <item id="Gilgal">
    <description>rolling. (1.) From the solemn transaction of the reading of the law in the valley of Shechem between Ebal and Gerizim the Israelites moved forward to Gilgal, and there made a permanent camp (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 9:6; 10:6</reflink>). It was "beside the oaks of Moreh," near which Abraham erected his first altar (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 12:6, 7</reflink>). This was one of the three towns to which Samuel resorted for the administration of justice (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 7:16</reflink>), and here also he offered sacrifices when the ark was no longer in the tabernacle at Shiloh (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 10:8; 13:7-9</reflink>). To this place, as to a central sanctuary, all Israel gathered to renew their allegiance to Saul (11:14). At a later period it became the scene of idolatrous worship (<reflink target="XXX">Hos. 4:15; 9:15</reflink>). It has been identified with the ruins of Jiljilieh, about 5 miles south-west of Shiloh and about the same distance from Bethel.</description>
    <description>(2.) The place in "the plains of Jericho," "in the east border of Jericho," where the Israelites first encamped after crossing the Jordan (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 4:19, 20</reflink>). Here they kept their first Passover in the land of Canaan (5:10) and renewed the rite of circumcision, and so "rolled away the reproach" of their Egyptian slavery. Here the twelve memorial stones, taken from the bed of the Jordan, were set up; and here also the tabernacle remained till it was removed to Shiloh (18:1). It has been identified with Tell Jiljulieh, about 5 miles from Jordan.</description>
    <description>(3.) A place, probably in the hill country of Ephraim, where there was a school of the prophets (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 4:38</reflink>), and whence Elijah and Elisha, who resided here, "went down" to Bethel (2:1,2). It is mentioned also in Deut. 11:30. It is now known as Jiljilia, a place 8 miles north of Bethel.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Giloh">
    <description>exile, a city in the south-west part of the hill-country of Judah (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 15:51</reflink>). It was the native place or residence of the traitor Ahithophel "the Gilonite" (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 15:51; 2 Sam. 15:12</reflink>), and where he committed suicide (17:23). It has been identified with Kurbet Jala, about 7 miles north of Hebron.</description>

  <item id="Gimzo">
    <description>a place fertile in sycamores, a city in the plain of Judah, the villages of which were seized by the Philistines (<reflink target="XXX">2 Chr. 28:18</reflink>). It is now called Jimzu, about 3 miles south-east of Ludd, i.e., Lydda.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Gin">
    <description>a trap. (1.) Ps. 140:5, 141:9, Amos 3:5, the Hebrew word used, _mokesh_, means a noose or "snare," as it is elsewhere rendered (<reflink target="XXX">Ps. 18:5; Prov. 13:14, etc.</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(2.) Job 18:9, Isa. 8:14, Heb. pah, a plate or thin layer; and hence a net, a snare, trap, especially of a fowler (<reflink target="XXX">Ps. 69: 22, "Let their table before them become a net;" Amos 3:5, "Doth a bird fall into a net [pah] upon the ground where there is no trap-stick [mokesh] for her? doth the net [pah] spring up from the ground and take nothing at all?", Gesenius.</reflink>)</description>

    <description>(5.) Heb. hesheb, the "curious girdle" (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 28:8; R.V., "cunningly woven band"</reflink>) was attached to the ephod, and was made of the same material.</description>
    <description>The common girdle was made of leather (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 1:8; Matt. 3:4</reflink>); a finer sort of linen (<reflink target="XXX">Jer. 13:1; Ezek. 16:10; Dan. 10:5</reflink>). Girdles of sackcloth were worn in token of sorrow (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 3:24; 22:12</reflink>). They were variously fastened to the wearer (<reflink target="XXX">Mark 1:6; Jer. 13:1; Ezek. 16:10</reflink>).</description>
    <description>The girdle was a symbol of strength and power (<reflink target="XXX">Job 12:18, 21; 30:11; Isa. 22:21; 45:5</reflink>). "Righteousness and faithfulness" are the girdle of the Messiah (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 11:5</reflink>).</description>
    <description>Girdles were used as purses or pockets (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 10:9. A. V., "purses;" R.V., marg., "girdles." Also Mark 6:8</reflink>).</description>

    <description>a native of the Philistine city of Gath (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 13:3</reflink>). Obed-edom, in whose house the ark was placed, is so designated (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 6:10</reflink>). Six hundred Gittites came with David from Gath into Israel (15:18, 19).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Gittith">
    <description>a stringed instrument of music. This word is found in the titles of Ps. 8, 81, 84. In these places the LXX. render the word by "on the wine-fats." The Targum explains by "on the harp which David brought from Gath." It is the only stringed instrument named in the titles of the Psalms.</description>

  <item id="Gizonite">
    <description>a name given to Hashem, an inhabitant of Gizoh, a place somewhere in the mountains of Judah (<reflink target="XXX">1 Chr. 11:34; 2 Sam. 23:32, 34</reflink>).</description>

  <item id="Glass">
    <description>was known to the Egyptians at a very early period of their national history, at least B.C. 1500. Various articles both useful and ornamental were made of it, as bottles, vases, etc. A glass bottle with the name of Sargon on it was found among the ruins of the north-west palace of Nimroud. The Hebrew word _zekukith_ (<reflink target="XXX">Job 28:17</reflink>), rendered in the Authorized Version "crystal," is rightly rendered in the Revised Version "glass." This is the only allusion to glass found in the Old Testament. It is referred to in the New Testament in Rev. 4:6; 15:2; 21:18, 21. In Job 37:18, the word rendered "looking-glass" is in the Revised Version properly rendered "mirror," formed, i.e., of some metal. (<reflink target="XXX">Comp. Ex. 38:8: "looking-glasses" are brazen mirrors, R.V.</reflink>). A mirror is referred to also in James 1:23.</description>

  <item id="Glean">
    <description>The corners of fields were not to be reaped, and the sheaf accidentally left behind was not to be fetched away, according to the law of Moses (<reflink target="XXX">Lev. 19:9; 23:22; Deut. 24:21</reflink>). They were to be left for the poor to glean. Similar laws were given regarding vineyards and oliveyards. (<reflink target="XXX">Comp. Ruth 2:2.</reflink>)</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Glede">
    <description>an Old English name for the common kite, mentioned only in Deut. 14:13 (Heb. ra'ah), the Milvus ater or black kite. The Hebrew word does not occur in the parallel passage in Leviticus (11:14, da'ah, rendered "vulture;" in R.V., "kite"). It was an unclean bird. The Hebrew name is from a root meaning "to see," "to look," thus designating a bird with a keen sight. The bird intended is probably the buzzard, of which there are three species found in Palestine. (<see target="x-self">See VULTURE.</see>)</description>

  <item id="Glorify">
    <description>(1.) To make glorious, or cause so to appear (<reflink target="XXX">John 12:28; 13:31, 32; 17:4,5</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(2.) Spoken of God to "shew forth his praise" (<reflink target="XXX">1 Cor. 6:20; 10:31</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Glory">
    <description>(Heb. kabhod; Gr. doxa). (1.) Abundance, wealth, treasure, and hence honour (<reflink target="XXX">Ps. 49:12</reflink>); glory (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 31:1; Matt. 4:8; Rev. 21:24, 26</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(2.) Honour, dignity (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 3:13; Heb. 2:7 1 Pet. 1:24</reflink>); of God (<reflink target="XXX">Ps. 19:1; 29:1</reflink>); of the mind or heart (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 49:6; Ps. 7:5; Acts 2:46</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(3.) Splendour, brightness, majesty (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 45:13; Isa. 4:5; Acts 22:11; 2 Cor. 3:7</reflink>); of Jehovah (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 59:19; 60:1; 2 Thess. 1:9</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(4.) The glorious moral attributes, the infinite perfections of God (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 40:5; Acts 7:2; Rom. 1:23; 9:23; Eph. 1:12</reflink>). Jesus is the "brightness of the Father's glory" (<reflink target="XXX">Heb. 1:3; John 1:14; 2:11</reflink>).</description>

    <description>(6.) The phrase "Give glory to God" (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 7:19; Jer. 13:16</reflink>) is a Hebrew idiom meaning, "Confess your sins." The words of the Jews to the blind man, "Give God the praise" (<reflink target="XXX">John 9:24</reflink>), are an adjuration to confess. They are equivalent to, "Confess that you are an impostor," "Give God the glory by speaking the truth;" for they denied that a miracle had been wrought.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Glutton">
    <description>(<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 21:20</reflink>), Heb. zolel, from a word meaning "to shake out," "to squander;" and hence one who is prodigal, who wastes his means by indulgence. In Prov. 23:21, the word means debauchees or wasters of their own body. In Prov. 28:7, the word (pl.) is rendered Authorized Version "riotous men;" Revised Version, "gluttonous." Matt. 11:19, Luke 7:34, Greek phagos, given to eating, gluttonous.</description>

  <item id="Gnash">
    <description>Heb. harak, meaning "to grate the teeth", (<reflink target="XXX">Job 16:9; Ps. 112:10; Lam. 2:16</reflink>), denotes rage or sorrow. (<reflink target="XXX">See also Acts 7:54; Mark 9:18.</reflink>)</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Gnat">
    <description>only in Matt. 23:24, a small two-winged stinging fly of the genus Culex, which includes mosquitoes. Our Lord alludes here to the gnat in a proverbial expression probably in common use, "who strain out the gnat;" the words in the Authorized Version, "strain at a gnat," being a mere typographical error, which has been corrected in the Revised Version. The custom of filtering wine for this purpose was common among the Jews. It was founded on Lev. 11:23. It is supposed that the "lice," Ex. 8:16 (marg. R.V., "sand-flies"), were a species of gnat.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Goad">
    <description>(Heb. malmad, only in Judg. 3: 31), an instrument used by ploughmen for guiding their oxen. Shamgar slew six hundred Philistines with an ox-goad. "The goad is a formidable weapon. It is sometimes ten feet long, and has a sharp point. We could now see that the feat of Shamgar was not so very wonderful as some have been accustomed to think."</description>
    <description>In 1 Sam. 13:21, a different Hebrew word is used, _dorban_, meaning something pointed. The expression (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 9:5, omitted in the R.V.</reflink>), "It is hard for thee to kick against the pricks", i.e., against the goad, was proverbial for unavailing resistance to superior power.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Goat">
    <description>(1.) Heb. 'ez, the she-goat (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 15:9; 30:35; 31:38</reflink>). This Hebrew word is also used for the he-goat (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 12:5; Lev. 4:23; Num. 28:15</reflink>), and to denote a kid (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 38:17, 20</reflink>). Hence it may be regarded as the generic name of the animal as domesticated. It literally means "strength," and points to the superior strength of the goat as compared with the sheep.</description>
    <description>(2.) Heb. 'attud, only in plural; rendered "rams" (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 31:10,12</reflink>); he-goats (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 7:17-88; Isa. 1:11</reflink>); goats (<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 32:14; Ps. 50:13</reflink>). They were used in sacrifice (<reflink target="XXX">Ps. 66:15</reflink>). This word is used metaphorically for princes or chiefs in Isa. 14:9, and in Zech. 10:3 as leaders. (<reflink target="XXX">Comp. Jer. 50:8.</reflink>)</description>
    <description>(3.) Heb. gedi, properly a kid. Its flesh was a delicacy among the Hebrews (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 27:9, 14, 17; Judg. 6:19</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(4.) Heb. sa'ir, meaning the "shaggy," a hairy goat, a he-goat (<reflink target="XXX">2 Chr. 29:23</reflink>); "a goat" (<reflink target="XXX">Lev. 4:24</reflink>); "satyr" (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 13:21</reflink>); "devils" (<reflink target="XXX">Lev. 17:7</reflink>). It is the goat of the sin-offering (<reflink target="XXX">Lev. 9:3, 15; 10:16</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(5.) Heb. tsaphir, a he-goat of the goats (<reflink target="XXX">2 Chr. 29:21</reflink>). In Dan. 8:5, 8 it is used as a symbol of the Macedonian empire.</description>
    <description>(6.) Heb. tayish, a "striker" or "butter," rendered "he-goat" (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 30:35; 32:14</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(7.) Heb. 'azazel (q.v.), the "scapegoat" (<reflink target="XXX">Lev. 16:8, 10,26</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(8.) There are two Hebrew words used to denote the undomesticated goat:, _Yael_, only in plural mountain goats (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 24:2; Job 39:1; Ps.104:18</reflink>). It is derived from a word meaning "to climb." It is the ibex, which abounded in the mountainous parts of Moab. And _'akko_, only in Deut. 14:5, the wild goat.</description>
    <description>Goats are mentioned in the New Testament in Matt. 25:32,33; Heb. 9:12,13, 19; 10:4. They represent oppressors and wicked men (<reflink target="XXX">Ezek. 34:17; 39:18; Matt. 25:33</reflink>).</description>
    <description>Several varieties of the goat were familiar to the Hebrews. They had an important place in their rural economy on account of the milk they afforded and the excellency of the flesh of the kid. They formed an important part of pastoral wealth (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 31:10, 12;32:14; 1 Sam. 25:2</reflink>).</description>

  </item>
  <item id="God">
    <description>(A.S. and Dutch God; Dan. Gud; Ger. Gott), the name of the Divine Being. It is the rendering (1) of the Hebrew _'El_, from a word meaning to be strong; (2) of _'Eloah_, plural _'Elohim_. The singular form, _Eloah_, is used only in poetry. The plural form is more commonly used in all parts of the Bible, The Hebrew word Jehovah (q.v.), the only other word generally employed to denote the Supreme Being, is uniformly rendered in the Authorized Version by "LORD," printed in small capitals. The existence of God is taken for granted in the Bible. There is nowhere any argument to prove it. He who disbelieves this truth is spoken of as one devoid of understanding (<reflink target="XXX">Ps. 14:1</reflink>).</description>
    <description>The arguments generally adduced by theologians in proof of the being of God are:</description>
    <description>(1.) The a priori argument, which is the testimony afforded by reason.</description>
    <description>(2.) The a posteriori argument, by which we proceed logically from the facts of experience to causes. These arguments are,</description>
    <description>(a) The cosmological, by which it is proved that there must be a First Cause of all things, for every effect must have a cause.</description>
    <description>(b) The teleological, or the argument from design. We see everywhere the operations of an intelligent Cause in nature.</description>
    <description>(c) The moral argument, called also the anthropological argument, based on the moral consciousness and the history of mankind, which exhibits a moral order and purpose which can only be explained on the supposition of the existence of God. Conscience and human history testify that "verily there is a God that judgeth in the earth."</description>
    <description>The attributes of God are set forth in order by Moses in Ex. 34:6,7. (<reflink target="XXX">see also Deut. 6:4; 10:17; Num. 16:22; Ex. 15:11; 33:19; Isa. 44:6; Hab. 3:6; Ps. 102:26; Job 34:12.</reflink>) They are also systematically classified in Rev. 5:12 and 7:12.</description>
    <description>God's attributes are spoken of by some as absolute, i.e., such as belong to his essence as Jehovah, Jah, etc.; and relative, i.e., such as are ascribed to him with relation to his creatures. Others distinguish them into communicable, i.e., those which can be imparted in degree to his creatures: goodness, holiness, wisdom, etc.; and incommunicable, which cannot be so imparted: independence, immutability, immensity, and eternity. They are by some also divided into natural attributes, eternity, immensity, etc.; and moral, holiness, goodness, etc.</description>

  <item id="Godliness">
    <description>the whole of practical piety (<reflink target="XXX">1 Tim. 4:8; 2 Pet. 1:6</reflink>). "It supposes knowledge, veneration, affection, dependence, submission, gratitude, and obedience." In 1 Tim. 3:16 it denotes the substance of revealed religion.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Goel">
    <description>in Hebrew the participle of the verb _gaal_, "to redeem." It is rendered in the Authorized Version "kinsman," Num. 5:8; Ruth 3:12; 4:1,6,8; "redeemer," Job 19:25; "avenger," Num. 35:12; Deut. 19:6, etc. The Jewish law gave the right of redeeming and repurchasing, as well as of avenging blood, to the next relative, who was accordingly called by this name.

  </item>
  <item id="Gog">
    <description>(1.) A Reubenite (<reflink target="XXX">1 Chr. 5:4</reflink>), the father of Shimei.</description>
    <description>(2.) The name of the leader of the hostile party described in Ezek. 38,39, as coming from the "north country" and assailing the people of Israel to their own destruction. This prophecy has been regarded as fulfilled in the conflicts of the Maccabees with Antiochus, the invasion and overthrow of the Chaldeans, and the temporary successes and destined overthrow of the Turks. But "all these interpretations are unsatisfactory and inadequate. The vision respecting Gog and Magog in the Apocalypse (<reflink target="XXX">Rev. 20:8</reflink>) is in substance a reannouncement of this prophecy of Ezekiel. But while Ezekiel contemplates the great conflict in a more general light as what was certainly to be connected with the times of the Messiah, and should come then to its last decisive issues, John, on the other hand, writing from the commencement of the Messiah's times, describes there the last struggles and victories of the cause of Christ. In both cases alike the vision describes the final workings of the world's evil and its results in connection with the kingdom of God, only the starting-point is placed further in advance in the one case than in the other."</description>
    <description>It has been supposed to be the name of a district in the wild north-east steppes of Central Asia, north of the Hindu-Kush, now a part of Turkestan, a region about 2,000 miles north-east of Nineveh.</description>

There are no further notices of it in Scripture. It became the head of the province of Gaulanitis, one of the four provinces into which Bashan was divided after the Babylonish captivity, and almost identical with the modern Jaulan, in Western Hauran, about 39 miles in length and 18 in breath.</description>

    <description>(5.) Heb. kethem, i.e., something concealed or separated (<reflink target="XXX">Job 28:16,19; Ps. 45:9; Prov. 25:12</reflink>). Rendered "golden wedge" in Isa. 13:12.</description>
    <description>(6.) Heb. haruts, i.e., dug out; poetic for gold (<reflink target="XXX">Prov. 8:10; 16:16; Zech. 9:3</reflink>).</description>
    <description>Gold was known from the earliest times (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 2:11</reflink>). It was principally used for ornaments (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 24:22</reflink>). It was very abundant (<reflink target="XXX">1 Chr. 22:14; Nah. 2:9; Dan. 3:1</reflink>). Many tons of it were used in connection with the temple (<reflink target="XXX">2 Chr. 1:15</reflink>). It was found in Arabia, Sheba, and Ophir (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 9:28; 10:1; Job 28:16</reflink>), but not in Palestine.</description>
    <description>In Dan. 2:38, the Babylonian Empire is spoken of as a "head of gold" because of its great riches; and Babylon was called by Isaiah (14:4) the "golden city" (R.V. marg., "exactress," adopting the reading _marhebah_, instead of the usual word _madhebah_).</description>

  </item>
  <item id="Golgotha">
    <description>the common name of the spot where Jesus was crucified. It is interpreted by the evangelists as meaning "the place of a skull" (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 27:33; Mark 15:22; John 19:17</reflink>). This name represents in Greek letters the Aramaic word Gulgaltha, which is the Hebrew Gulgoleth (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 1:2; 1 Chr. 23:3, 24; 2 Kings 9:35</reflink>), meaning "a skull." It is identical with the word Calvary (q.v.). It was a little knoll rounded like a bare skull. It is obvious from the evangelists that it was some well-known spot outside the gate (<reflink target="XXX">comp. Heb. 13:12</reflink>), and near the city (<reflink target="XXX">Luke 23:26</reflink>), containing a "garden" (<reflink target="XXX">John 19:41</reflink>), and on a thoroughfare leading into the country. Hence it is an untenable idea that it is embraced within the present "Church of the Holy Sepulchre." The hillock above Jeremiah's Grotto, to the north of the city, is in all probability the true site of Calvary. The skull-like appearance of the rock in the southern precipice of the hillock is very remarkable.</description>

  <item id="Goliath">
    <description>great. (1.) A famous giant of Gath, who for forty days openly defied the armies of Israel, but was at length slain by David with a stone from a sling (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 17:4</reflink>). He was probably descended from the Rephaim who found refuge among the Philistines after they were dispersed by the Ammonites (<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 2:20, 21</reflink>). His height was "six cubits and a span," which, taking the cubit at 21 inches, is equal to 10 1/2 feet. David cut off his head (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 17:51</reflink>) and brought it to Jerusalem, while he hung the armour which he took from him in his tent. His sword was preserved at Nob as a religious trophy (21:9). David's victory over Goliath was the turning point in his life. He came into public notice now as the deliverer of Israel and the chief among Saul's men of war (18:5), and the devoted friend of Jonathan.</description>
    <description>(2.) In 2 Sam. 21:19 there is another giant of the same name mentioned as slain by Elhanan. The staff of his apear "was like a weaver's beam." The Authorized Version interpolates the words "the brother of" from 1 Chr. 20:5, where this giant is called Lahmi.</description>

  <item id="Gomer">
    <description>complete; vanishing. (1.) The daughter of Diblaim, who (probably in vision only) became the wife of Hosea (1:3).</description>
    <description>(2.) The eldest son of Japheth, and father of Ashkenaz, Riphath, and Togarmah (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 10:2, 3</reflink>), whose descendants formed the principal branch of the population of South-eastern Europe. He is generally regarded as the ancestor of the Celtae and the Cimmerii, who in early times settled to the north of the Black Sea, and gave their name to the Crimea, the ancient Chersonesus Taurica. Traces of their presence are found in the names Cimmerian Bosphorus, Cimmerian Isthmus, etc. In the seventh century B.C. they were driven out of their original seat by the Scythians, and overran western Asia Minor, whence they were afterwards expelled. They subsequently reappear in the times of the Romans as the Cimbri of the north and west of Europe, whence they crossed to the British Isles, where their descendants are still found in the Gaels and Cymry. Thus the whole Celtic race may be regarded as descended from Gomer.</description>

  <item id="Gomorrah">
    <description>submersion, one of the five cities of the plain of Siddim (q.v.) which were destroyed by fire (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 10:19; 13:10; 19:24, 28</reflink>). These cities probably stood close together, and were near the northern extremity of what is now the Dead Sea. This city is always mentioned next after Sodom, both of which were types of impiety and wickedness (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 18:20; Rom. 9:29</reflink>). Their destruction is mentioned as an "ensample unto those that after should live ungodly" (<reflink target="XXX">2 Pet. 2:6; Jude 1:4-7</reflink>). Their wickedness became proverbial (<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 32:32; Isa. 1:9, 10; Jer. 23:14</reflink>). But that wickedness may be exceeded (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 10:15; Mark 6:11</reflink>). (<see target="x-self">See DEAD SEA</see>).</description>

  <item id="Goodness">
    <description>in man is not a mere passive quality, but the deliberate preference of right to wrong, the firm and persistent resistance of all moral evil, and the choosing and following of all moral good.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Goodness of God">
    <description>a perfection of his character which he exercises towards his creatures according to their various circumstances and relations (<reflink target="XXX">Ps. 145:8, 9; 103:8; 1 John 4:8</reflink>). Viewed generally, it is benevolence; as exercised with respect to the miseries of his creatures it is mercy, pity, compassion, and in the case of impenitent sinners, long-suffering patience; as exercised in communicating favour on the unworthy it is grace. "Goodness and justice are the several aspects of one unchangeable, infinitely wise, and sovereign moral perfection. God is not sometimes merciful and sometimes just, but he is eternally infinitely just and merciful." God is infinitely and unchangeably good (<reflink target="XXX">Zeph. 3:17</reflink>), and his goodness is incomprehensible by the finite mind (<reflink target="XXX">Rom. 11: 35, 36</reflink>). "God's goodness appears in two things, giving and forgiving."</description>

  <item id="Gopher">
    <description>a tree from the wood of which Noah was directed to build the ark (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 6:14</reflink>). It is mentioned only there. The LXX. render this word by "squared beams," and the Vulgate by "planed wood." Other versions have rendered it "pine" and "cedar;" but the weight of authority is in favour of understanding by it the cypress tree, which grows abundantly in Chaldea and Armenia.</description>

  <item id="Goshen">
    <description>(1.) A district in Egypt where Jacob and his family settled, and in which they remained till the Exodus (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 45:10; 46:28, 29, 31, etc.</reflink>). It is called "the land of Goshen" (47:27), and also simply "Goshen" (46:28), and "the land of Rameses" (47:11; Ex. 12:37), for the towns Pithom and Rameses lay within its borders; also Zoan or Tanis (<reflink target="XXX">Ps. 78:12</reflink>). It lay on the east of the Nile, and apparently not far from the royal residence. It was "the best of the land" (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 47:6, 11</reflink>), but is now a desert. It is first mentioned in Joseph's message to his father. It has been identified with the modern Wady Tumilat, lying between the eastern part of the Delta and the west border of Palestine. It was a pastoral district, where some of the king's cattle were kept (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 47:6</reflink>). The inhabitants were not exclusively Israelites (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 3:22; 11:2; 12:35, 36</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(2.) A district in Palestine (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 10:41; 11:16</reflink>). It was a part of the maritime plain of Judah, and lay between Gaza and Gibeon.</description>

  </item>
  <item id="Gospel">
    <description>a word of Anglo-Saxon origin, and meaning "God's spell", i.e., word of God, or rather, according to others, "good spell", i.e., good news. It is the rendering of the Greek _evangelion_, i.e., "good message." It denotes (1) "the welcome intelligence of salvation to man as preached by our Lord and his followers. (2.) It was afterwards transitively applied to each of the four histories of our Lord's life, published by those who are therefore called 'Evangelists', writers of the history of the gospel (the evangelion). (3.) The term is often used to express collectively the gospel doctrines; and 'preaching the gospel' is often used to include not only the proclaiming of the good tidings, but the teaching men how to avail themselves of the offer of salvation, the declaring of all the truths, precepts, promises, and threatenings of Christianity." It is termed "the gospel of the grace of God" (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 20:24</reflink>), "the gospel of the kingdom" (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 4:23</reflink>), "the gospel of Christ" (<reflink target="XXX">Rom. 1:16</reflink>), "the gospel of peace (<reflink target="XXX">Eph. 6:15</reflink>), "the glorious gospel," "the everlasting gospel," "the gospel of salvation" (<reflink target="XXX">Eph. 1:13</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Gospels">
    <description>The central fact of Christian preaching was the intelligence that the Saviour had come into the world (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 4:23; Rom. 10:15</reflink>); and the first Christian preachers who called their account of the person and mission of Christ by the term _evangelion_ (= good message) were called _evangelistai_ (= evangelists) (<reflink target="XXX">Eph. 4:11; Acts 21:8</reflink>).</description>
    <description>There are four historical accounts of the person and work of Christ: "the first by Matthew, announcing the Redeemer as the promised King of the kingdom of God; the second by Mark, declaring him 'a prophet, mighty in deed and word'; the third by Luke, of whom it might be said that he represents Christ in the special character of the Saviour of sinners (<reflink target="XXX">Luke 7:36; 15:18</reflink>); the fourth by John, who represents Christ as the Son of God, in whom deity and humanity become one. The ancient Church gave to Matthew the symbol of the lion, to Mark that of a man, to Luke that of the ox, and to John that of the eagle: these were the four faces of the cherubim" (<reflink target="XXX">Ezek. 1:10</reflink>).</description>
    <description>Date. The Gospels were all composed during the latter part of the first century, and there is distinct historical evidence to show that they were used and accepted as authentic before the end of the second century.</description>
    <description>Mutual relation. "If the extent of all the coincidences be represented by 100, their proportionate distribution will be: Matthew, Mark, and Luke, 53; Matthew and Luke, 21; Matthew and Mark, 20; Mark and Luke, 6. Looking only at the general result, it may be said that of the contents of the synoptic Gospels [i.e., the first three Gospels] about two-fifths are common to the three, and that the parts peculiar to one or other of them are little more than one-third of the whole."</description>
    <description>Origin. Did the evangelists copy from one another? The opinion is well founded that the Gospels were published by the apostles orally before they were committed to writing, and that each had an independent origin. (<see target="x-self">See MATTHEW, GOSPEL OF.</see>)</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Gourd">
    <description>(1.) Jonah's gourd (<reflink target="XXX">Jonah 4:6-10</reflink>), bearing the Hebrew name _kikayon_ (found only here), was probably the kiki of the Egyptians, the croton. This is the castor-oil plant, a species of ricinus, the palma Christi, so called from the palmate division of its leaves. Others with more probability regard it as the cucurbita the el-keroa of the Arabs, a kind of pumpkin peculiar to the East. "It is grown in great abundance on the alluvial banks of the Tigris and on the plain between the river and the ruins of Nineveh." At the present day it is trained to run over structures of mud and brush to form boots to protect the gardeners from the heat of the noon-day sun. It grows with extraordinary rapidity, and when cut or injured withers away also with great rapidity.</description>
    <description>(2.) Wild gourds (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 4:38-40</reflink>), Heb. pakkuoth, belong to the family of the cucumber-like plants, some of which are poisonous. The species here referred to is probably the colocynth (Cucumis colocynthus). The LXX. render the word by "wild pumpkin." It abounds in the desert parts of Syria, Egypt, and Arabia. There is, however, another species, called the Cucumis prophetarum, from the idea that it afforded the gourd which "the sons of the prophets" shred by mistake into their pottage.</description>

This is a foreign word, Assyrian, which was early adopted into the Hebrew idiom (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 10:15</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(9.) The Chaldean word _segan_ is applied to the governors of the Babylonian satrapies (<reflink target="XXX">Dan. 3:2, 27; 6:7</reflink>); the prefects over the Magi (2:48). The corresponding Hebrew word _segan_ is used of provincial rulers (<reflink target="XXX">Jer. 51:23, 28, 57</reflink>); also of chiefs and rulers of the people of Jerusalem (<reflink target="XXX">Ezra 9:2; Neh. 2:16; 4:14, 19; 5:7, 17; 7:5; 12:40</reflink>).</description>

Graves were generally grottoes or caves, natural or hewn out in rocks (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 22:16; Matt. 27:60</reflink>). There were family cemeteries (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 47:29; 50:5; 2 Sam. 19:37</reflink>). Public burial-places were assigned to the poor (<reflink target="XXX">Jer. 26:23; 2 Kings 23:6</reflink>). Graves were usually closed with stones, which were whitewashed, to warn strangers against contact with them (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 23:27</reflink>), which caused ceremonial pollution (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 19:16</reflink>).</description>

    <description>(5.) Pathah refers to intaglio work, the cutting and engraving of precious stones (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 28:9-11, 21; Zech. 3:9; Cant. 1:10, 11</reflink>).</description>

  <item id="Greece">
    <description>orginally consisted of the four provinces of Macedonia, Epirus, Achaia, and Peleponnesus. In Acts 20:2 it designates only the Roman province of Macedonia. Greece was conquered by the Romans B.C. 146. After passing through various changes it was erected into an independent monarchy in 1831.</description>
    <description>Moses makes mention of Greece under the name of Javan (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 10:2-5</reflink>); and this name does not again occur in the Old Testament till the time of Joel (3:6). Then the Greeks and Hebrews first came into contact in the Tyrian slave-market. Prophetic notice is taken of Greece in Dan. 8:21.</description>
    <description>The cities of Greece were the special scenes of the labours of the apostle Paul.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Greek">
    <description>Found only in the New Testament, where a distinction is observed between "Greek" and "Grecian" (q.v.). The former is (1) a Greek by race (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 16:1-3; 18:17; Rom. 1:14</reflink>), or (2) a Gentile as opposed to a Jew (<reflink target="XXX">Rom. 2:9, 10</reflink>). The latter, meaning properly "one who speaks Greek," is a foreign Jew opposed to a home Jew who dwelt in Palestine.</description>
    <description>The word "Grecians" in Acts 11:20 should be "Greeks," denoting the heathen Greeks of that city, as rendered in the Revised Version according to the reading of the best manuscripts ("Hellenes").</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Greyhound">
    <description>(<reflink target="XXX">Prov. 30:31</reflink>), the rendering of the Hebrew _zarzir mothnayim_, meaning literally "girded as to the lions." Some (Gesen.; R.V. marg.) render it "war-horse." The LXX. and Vulgate versions render it "cock." It has been by some interpreters rendered also "stag" and "warrior," as being girded about or panoplied, and "wrestler." The greyhound, however, was evidently known in ancient times, as appears from Egyptian monuments.</description>

  <item id="Grind">
    <description>(<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 32:20; Deut. 9:21; Judg. 16:21</reflink>), to crush small (Heb. tahan); to oppress the poor (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 3:5</reflink>). The hand-mill was early used by the Hebrews (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 11:8</reflink>). It consisted of two stones, the upper (<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 24:6; 2 Sam. 11:21</reflink>) being movable and slightly concave, the lower being stationary. The grinders mentioned Eccl. 12:3 are the teeth. (<see target="x-self">See MILL.</see>)</description>

  <item id="Grove">
    <description>(1.) Heb. 'asherah, properly a wooden image, or a pillar representing Ashtoreth, a sensual Canaanitish goddess, probably usually set up in a grove (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 21:7; 23:4</reflink>). In the Revised Version the word "Asherah" (q.v.) is introduced as a proper noun, the name of the wooden symbol of a goddess, with the plurals Asherim (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 34:13</reflink>) and Asheroth (<reflink target="XXX">Judg. 3:13</reflink>).</description>
    <description>The LXX. have rendered _asherah_ in 2 Chr. 15:16 by "Astarte." The Vulgate has done this also in Judg. 3:7.</description>
    <description>(2.) Heb. 'eshel (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 21:33</reflink>). In 1 Sam. 22:6 and 31:13 the Authorized Version renders this word by "tree." In all these passages the Revised Version renders by "tamarisk tree." It has been identified with the Tamariscus orientalis, five species of which are found in Palestine.</description>
    <description>(3.) The Heb. word 'elon, uniformly rendered in the Authorized Version by "plain," properly signifies a grove or plantation. In the Revised Version it is rendered, pl., "oaks" (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 13:18; 14:13; 18:1; 12:6; Deut. 11:30; Josh. 19:33</reflink>). In the earliest times groves are mentioned in connection with religious worship. The heathen consecrated groves to particular gods, and for this reason they were forbidden to the Jews (<reflink target="XXX">Jer. 17:3; Ezek. 20:28</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Guard">
    <description>(1.) Heb. tabbah (properly a "cook," and in a secondary sense "executioner," because this office fell to the lot of the cook in Eastern countries), the bodyguard of the kings of Egypt (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 37:36</reflink>) and Babylon (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 25:8; Jer. 40:1; Dan. 2:14</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(2.) Heb. rats, properly a "courier," one whose office was to run before the king's chariot (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 15:1; 1 Kings 1:5</reflink>). The couriers were also military guards (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 22:17; 2 Kings 10:25</reflink>). They were probably the same who under David were called Pelethites (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 14:27; 2 Sam. 15:1</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(3.) Heb. mishmereth, one who watches (<reflink target="XXX">Neh. 4:22</reflink>), or a watch-station (7:3; 12:9; Job 7:12).</description>
    <description>In the New Testament (<reflink target="XXX">Mark 6:27</reflink>) the Authorized Version renders the Greek _spekulator_ by "executioner," earlier English versions by "hangman," the Revised Version by "soldier of his guard." The word properly means a "pikeman" or "halberdier," of whom the bodyguard of kings and princes was composed. In Matt. 27:65, 66; 28:11, the Authorized Version renders the Greek _kustodia_ by "watch," and the Revised Version by "guard," the Roman guard, which consisted of four soldiers, who were relieved every three hours (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 12:4</reflink>). The "captain of the guard" mentioned Acts 28:16 was the commander of the Praetorian troops, whose duty it was to receive and take charge of all prisoners from the provinces.</description>

  <item id="Guest-chamber">
    <description>the spare room on the upper floor of an Eastern dwelling (<reflink target="XXX">Mark 14:14; Luke 22:11</reflink>). In Luke 2:7 the word is translated "inn" (q.v.).</description>

  <item id="Gutter">
    <description>Heb. tsinnor, (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 5:8</reflink>). This Hebrew word occurs only elsewhere in Ps. 42:7 in the plural, where it is rendered "waterspouts." It denotes some passage through which water passed; a water-course.</description>
    <description>In Gen. 30:38, 41 the Hebrew word rendered "gutters" is _rahat_, and denotes vessels overflowing with water for cattle (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 2:16</reflink>); drinking-troughs.</description>

  <item id="Habakkuk">
    <description>embrace, the eighth of the twelve minor prophets. Of his personal history we have no reliable information. He was probably a member of the Levitical choir. He was contemporary with Jeremiah and Zephaniah.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Habakkuk, Prophecies of">
    <description>were probably written about B.C. 650-627, or, as some think, a few years later. This book consists of three chapters, the contents of which are thus comprehensively described: "When the prophet in spirit saw the formidable power of the Chaldeans approaching and menacing his land, and saw the great evils they would cause in Judea, he bore his complaints and doubts before Jehovah, the just and the pure (1:2-17). And on this occasion the future punishment of the Chaldeans was revealed to him (2). In the third chapter a presentiment of the destruction of his country, in the inspired heart of the prophet, contends with his hope that the enemy would be chastised." The third chapter is a sublime song dedicated "to the chief musician," and therefore intended apparently to be used in the worship of God. It is "unequalled in majesty and splendour of language and imagery."</description>
    <description>The passage in 2:4, "The just shall live by his faith," is quoted by the apostle in Rom. 1:17. (<reflink target="XXX">Comp. Gal. 3:12; Heb. 10:37, 38.</reflink>)</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Habergeon">
    <description>an Old English word for breastplate. In Job 41:26 (Heb. shiryah) it is properly a "coat of mail;" the Revised Version has "pointed shaft." In Ex. 28:32, 39:23, it denotes a military garment strongly and thickly woven and covered with mail round the neck and breast. Such linen corselets have been found in Egypt. The word used in these verses is _tahra_, which is of Egyptian origin. The Revised Version, however, renders it by "coat of mail." (<see target="x-self">See ARMOUR.</see>)</description>

  <item id="Habitation">
    <description>God is the habitation of his people, who find rest and safety in him (<reflink target="XXX">Ps. 71:3; 91:9</reflink>). Justice and judgment are the habitation of God's throne (<reflink target="XXX">Ps. 89:14, Heb. mekhon, "foundation"</reflink>), because all his acts are founded on justice and judgment. (<reflink target="XXX">See Ps. 132:5, 13; Eph. 2:22, of Canaan, Jerusalem, and the temple as God's habitation.</reflink>) God inhabits eternity (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 57:15</reflink>), i.e., dwells not only among men, but in eternity, where time is unknown; and "the praises of Israel" (<reflink target="XXX">Ps. 22:3</reflink>), i.e., he dwells among those praises and is continually surrounded by them.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Habor">
    <description>the united stream, or, according to others, with beautiful banks, the name of a river in Assyria, and also of the district through which it flowed (<reflink target="XXX">1 Chr. 5:26</reflink>). There is a river called Khabur which rises in the central highlands of Kurdistan, and flows south-west till it falls into the Tigris, about 70 miles above Mosul. This was not, however, the Habor of Scripture.</description>
    <description>There is another river of the same name (the Chaboras) which, after a course of about 200 miles, flows into the Euphrates at Karkesia, the ancient Circesium. This was, there can be little doubt, the ancient Habor.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Hachilah">
    <description>the darksome hill, one of the peaks of the long ridge of el-Kolah, running out of the Ziph plateau, "on the south of Jeshimon" (i.e., of the "waste"), the district to which one looks down from the plateau of Ziph (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 23:19</reflink>). After his reconciliation with Saul at Engedi (24:1-8), David returned to Hachilah, where he had fixed his quarters. The Ziphites treacherously informed Saul of this, and he immediately (26:1-4) renewed his pursuit of David, and "pitched in the hill of Hachilah." David and his nephew Abishai stole at night into the midst of Saul's camp, when they were all asleep, and noiselessly removed the royal spear and the cruse from the side of the king, and then, crossing the intervening valley to the height on the other side, David cried to the people, and thus awoke the sleepers. He then addressed Saul, who recognized his voice, and expostulated with him. Saul professed to be penitent; but David could not put confidence in him, and he now sought refuge at Ziklag. David and Saul never afterwards met. (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 26:13-25</reflink>).</description>

  <item id="Hadad">
    <description>Adod, brave(?), the name of a Syrian god. (1.) An Edomite king who defeated the Midianites (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 36:35; 1 Chr. 1:46</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(2.) Another Edomite king (<reflink target="XXX">1 Chr. 1:50, 51</reflink>), called also Hadar (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 36:39; 1 Chr. 1:51</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(3.) One of "the king's seed in Edom." He fled into Egypt, where he married the sister of Pharaoh's wife (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 11:14-22</reflink>). He became one of Solomon's adversaries.</description>
    <description>Hadad, sharp, (a different name in Hebrew from the preceding), one of the sons of Ishmael (<reflink target="XXX">1 Chr. 1:30</reflink>). Called also Hadar (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 25:15</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Hadad-rimmon">
    <description>(composed of the names of two Syrian idols), the name of a place in the valley of Megiddo. It is alluded to by the prophet Zechariah (12:11) in a proverbial expression derived from the lamentation for Josiah, who was mortally wounded near this place (<reflink target="XXX">2 Chr. 35:22-25</reflink>). It has been identified with the modern Rummaneh, a village "at the foot of the Megiddo hills, in a notch or valley about an hour and a half south of Tell Metzellim."</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Hadadezer">
    <description>Hadad is help; called also Hadarezer, Adod is his help, the king of Zobah. Hanun, the king of the Ammonites, hired among others the army of Hadadezer to assist him in his war against David. Joab, who was sent against this confederate host, found them in double battle array, the Ammonities toward their capital of Rabbah, and the Syrian mercenaries near Medeba. In the battle which was fought the Syrians were scattered, and the Ammonites in alarm fled into their capital. After this Hadadezer went north "to recover his border" (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 8:3, A.V.</reflink>); but rather, as the Revised Version renders, "to recover his dominion", i.e., to recruit his forces. Then followed another battle with the Syrian army thus recruited, which resulted in its being totally routed at Helam (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 10:17</reflink>). Shobach, the leader of the Syrian army, died on the field of battle. The Syrians of Damascus, who had come to help Hadadezer, were also routed, and Damascus was made tributary to David. All the spoils taken in this war, "shields of gold" and "very much brass," from which afterwards the "brasen sea, and the pillars, and the vessels of brass" for the temple were made (<reflink target="XXX">1 Chr. 18:8</reflink>), were brought to Jerusalem and dedicated to Jehovah. Thus the power of the Ammonites and the Syrians was finally broken, and David's empire extended to the Euphrates (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 10:15-19; 1 Chr. 19:15-19</reflink>).</description>

    <description>that which is out of sight, a Greek word used to denote the state or place of the dead. All the dead alike go into this place. To be buried, to go down to the grave, to descend into hades, are equivalent expressions. In the LXX. this word is the usual rendering of the Hebrew sheol, the common receptacle of the departed (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 42:38; Ps. 139:8; Hos. 13:14; Isa. 14:9</reflink>). This term is of comparatively rare occurrence in the Greek New Testament. Our Lord speaks of Capernaum as being "brought down to hell" (hades), i.e., simply to the lowest debasement, (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 11:23</reflink>). It is contemplated as a kind of kingdom which could never overturn the foundation of Christ's kingdom (16:18), i.e., Christ's church can never die.</description>
    <description>In Luke 16:23 it is most distinctly associated with the doom and misery of the lost.</description>
    <description>In Acts 2:27-31 Peter quotes the LXX. version of Ps. 16:8-11, plainly for the purpose of proving our Lord's resurrection from the dead. David was left in the place of the dead, and his body saw corruption. Not so with Christ. According to ancient prophecy (<reflink target="XXX">Ps. 30:3</reflink>) he was recalled to life.</description>

    <description>or Emerods, bleeding piles known to the ancient Romans as mariscae, but more probably malignant boils of an infectious and fatal character. With this loathsome and infectious disease the men of Ashdod were smitten by the hand of the Lord. This calamity they attributed to the presence of the ark in their midst, and therefore they removed it to Gath (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 5:6-8</reflink>). But the same consequences followed from its presence in Gath, and therefore they had it removed to Ekron, 11 miles distant. The Ekronites were afflicted with the same dreadful malady, but more severely; and a panic seizing the people, they demanded that the ark should be sent back to the land of Israel (9-12; 6:1-9).</description>

When she was about to become a mother she fled from the cruelty of her mistress, intending apparently to return to her relatives in Egypt, through the desert of Shur, which lay between. Wearied and worn she had reached the place she distinguished by the name of Beer-lahai-roi ("the well of the visible God"), where the angel of the Lord appeared to her. In obedience to the heavenly visitor she returned to the tent of Abraham, where her son Ishmael was born, and where she remained (16) till after the birth of Isaac, the space of fourteen years. Sarah after this began to vent her dissatisfaction both on Hagar and her child. Ishmael's conduct was insulting to Sarah, and she insisted that he and his mother should be dismissed. This was accordingly done, although with reluctance on the part of Abraham (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 21:14</reflink>). They wandered out into the wilderness, where Ishmael, exhausted with his journey and faint from thirst, seemed about to die. Hagar "lifted up her voice and wept," and the angel of the Lord, as before, appeared unto her, and she was comforted and delivered out of her distresses (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 21:18, 19</reflink>).</description>
    <description>Ishmael afterwards established himself in the wilderness of Paran, where he married an Egyptian (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 21:20,21</reflink>).</description>

    <description>(3.) In the reign of Saul a great war was waged between the trans-Jordanic tribes and the Hagarites (1 Chr. 5), who were overcome in battle. A great booty was captured by the two tribes and a half, and they took possession of the land of the Hagarites.</description>
    <description>Subsequently the "Hagarenes," still residing in the land on the east of Jordan, entered into a conspiracy against Israel (<reflink target="XXX">comp. Ps. 83:6</reflink>). They are distinguished from the Ishmaelites.</description>

  <item id="Haggai">
    <description>festive, one of the twelve so-called minor prophets. He was the first of the three (Zechariah, his contemporary, and Malachi, who was about one hundred years later, being the other two) whose ministry belonged to the period of Jewish history which began after the return from captivity in Babylon. Scarcely anything is known of his personal history. He may have been one of the captives taken to Babylon by Nebuchadnezzar. He began his ministry about sixteen years after the Return. The work of rebuilding the temple had been put a stop to through the intrigues of the Samaritans. After having been suspended for fifteen years, the work was resumed through the efforts of Haggai and Zechariah (<reflink target="XXX">Ezra 6:14</reflink>), who by their exhortations roused the people from their lethargy, and induced them to take advantage of the favourable opportunity that had arisen in a change in the policy of the Persian government. (<see target="x-self">See DARIUS [2].</see>) Haggai's prophecies have thus been characterized:, "There is a ponderous and simple dignity in the emphatic reiteration addressed alike to every class of the community, prince, priest, and people, 'Be strong, be strong, be strong' (2:4). 'Cleave, stick fast, to the work you have to do;' or again, 'Consider your ways, consider, consider, consider' (1:5, 7;2:15, 18). It is the Hebrew phrase for the endeavour, characteristic of the gifted seers of all times, to compel their hearers to turn the inside of their hearts outwards to their own view, to take the mask from off their consciences, to 'see life steadily, and to see it wholly.'", Stanley's Jewish Church.

    <description>festive; the dancer, a wife of David and the mother of Adonijah (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 3:4; 1 Kings 1:5, 11; 2:13; 1 Chr. 3:2</reflink>), who, like Absalom, was famed for his beauty.</description>

  <item id="Hagiographa">
    <description>the holy writings, a term which came early into use in the Christian church to denote the third division of the Old Testament scriptures, called by the Jews Kethubim, i.e., "Writings." It consisted of five books, viz., Job, Proverbs, and Psalms, and the two books of Chronicles. The ancient Jews classified their sacred books as the Law, the Prophets, and the Kethubim, or Writings. (<see target="x-self">See BIBLE.</see>)</description>
    <description>In the New Testament (<reflink target="XXX">Luke 24:44</reflink>) we find three corresponding divisions, viz., the Law, the Prophets, and the Psalms.</description>

  <item id="Hail">
    <description>frozen rain-drops; one of the plagues of Egypt (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 9:23</reflink>). It is mentioned by Haggai as a divine judgment (<reflink target="XXX">Hag. 2:17</reflink>). A hail-storm destroyed the army of the Amorites when they fought against Joshua (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 10:11</reflink>). Ezekiel represents the wall daubed with untempered mortar as destroyed by great hail-stones (<reflink target="XXX">Ezek. 13:11</reflink>). (<reflink target="XXX">See also 38:22; Rev. 8:7; 11:19; 16:21.</reflink>)</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Hail!">
    <description>a salutation expressive of a wish for the welfare of the person addressed; the translation of the Greek _Chaire_, "Rejoice" (<reflink target="XXX">Luke 1:8</reflink>). Used in mockery in Matt. 27:29.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Hair">
    <description>(1.) The Egyptians let the hair of their head and beard grow only when they were in mourning, shaving it off at other times. "So particular were they on this point that to have neglected it was a subject of reproach and ridicule; and whenever they intended to convey the idea of a man of low condition, or a slovenly person, the artists represented him with a beard." Joseph shaved himself before going in to Pharoah (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 41:14</reflink>). The women of Egypt wore their hair long and plaited. Wigs were worn by priests and laymen to cover the shaven skull, and false beards were common. The great masses of hair seen in the portraits and statues of kings and priests are thus altogether artificial.</description>
    <description>(2.) A precisely opposite practice, as regards men, prevailed among the Assyrians. In Assyrian sculptures the hair always appears long, and combed closely down upon the head. The beard also was allowed to grow to its full length.</description>
    <description>(3.) Among the Greeks the custom in this respect varied at different times, as it did also among the Romans. In the time of the apostle, among the Greeks the men wore short hair, while that of the women was long (<reflink target="XXX">1 Cor. 11:14, 15</reflink>). Paul reproves the Corinthians for falling in with a style of manners which so far confounded the distinction of the sexes and was hurtful to good morals. (See, however, 1 Tim. 2:9, and 1 Pet. 3:3, as regards women.)</description>
    <description>(4.) Among the Hebrews the natural distinction between the sexes was preserved by the women wearing long hair (<reflink target="XXX">Luke 7:38; John 11:2; 1 Cor. 11:6</reflink>), while the men preserved theirs as a rule at a moderate length by frequent clipping.</description>
    <description>Baldness disqualified any one for the priest's office (Lev. 21).</description>
    <description>Elijah is called a "hairy man" (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 1:8</reflink>) from his flowing locks, or more probably from the shaggy cloak of hair which he wore. His raiment was of camel's hair.</description>
    <description>Long hair is especially noticed in the description of Absalom's person (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 14:26</reflink>); but the wearing of long hair was unusual, and was only practised as an act of religious observance by Nazarites (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 6:5; Judg. 13:5</reflink>) and others in token of special mercies (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 18:18</reflink>).</description>
    <description>In times of affliction the hair was cut off (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 3:17, 24; 15:2; 22:12; Jer. 7:29; Amos 8:10</reflink>). Tearing the hair and letting it go dishevelled were also tokens of grief (<reflink target="XXX">Ezra 9:3</reflink>). "Cutting off the hair" is a figure of the entire destruction of a people (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 7:20</reflink>). The Hebrews anointed the hair profusely with fragrant ointments (<reflink target="XXX">Ruth 3:3; 2 Sam. 14:2; Ps. 23:5; 45:7, etc.</reflink>), especially in seasons of rejoicing (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 6:17; Luke 7:46</reflink>).</description>

  <item id="Hakkoz">
    <description>the thorn, the head of one of the courses of the priests (<reflink target="XXX">1 Chr. 24:10</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Halah">
    <description>a district of Media to which captive Israelites were transported by the Assyrian kings (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 17:6; 18:11; 1 Chr. 5:26</reflink>). It lay along the banks of the upper Khabur, from its source to its junction with the Jerujer. Probably the district called by Ptolemy Chalcitis.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Halak">
    <description>smooth; bald, a hill at the southern extremity of Canaan (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 11:17</reflink>). It is referred to as if it were a landmark in that direction, being prominent and conspicuous from a distance. It has by some been identified with the modern Jebel el-Madura, on the south frontier of Judah, between the south end of the Dead Sea and the Wady Gaian.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Halhul">
    <description>full of hollows, a town in the highlands of Judah (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 15:58</reflink>). It is now a small village of the same name, and is situated about 5 miles north-east of Hebron on the way to Jerusalem. There is an old Jewish tradition that Gad, David's seer (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 24:11</reflink>), was buried here.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Hall">
    <description>(Gr. aule, Luke 22:55; R.V., "court"), the open court or quadrangle belonging to the high priest's house. In Matt. 26:69 and Mark 14:66 this word is incorrectly rendered "palace" in the Authorized Version, but correctly "court" in the Revised Version. In John 10:1,16 it means a "sheep-fold." In Matt. 27:27 and Mark 15:16 (A.V., "common hall;" R.V., "palace") it refers to the proetorium or residence of the Roman governor at Jerusalem. The "porch" in Matt. 26:71 is the entrance-hall or passage leading into the central court, which is open to the sky.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Hallel">
    <description>praise, the name given to the group of Psalms 113-118, which are preeminently psalms of praise. It is called "The Egyptian Hallel," because it was chanted in the temple whilst the Passover lambs were being slain. It was chanted also on other festival occasions, as at Pentecost, the feast of Tabernacles, and the feast of Dedication. The Levites, standing before the altar, chanted it verse by verse, the people responding by repeating the verses or by intoned hallelujahs. It was also chanted in private families at the feast of Passover. This was probably the hymn which our Saviour and his disciples sung at the conclusion of the Passover supper kept by them in the upper room at Jerusalem (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 26:30; Mark 14:26</reflink>).</description>
    <description>There is also another group called "The Great Hallel," comprehending Psalms 118-136, which was recited on the first evening at the Passover supper and on occasions of great joy.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Hallelujah">
    <description>praise ye Jehovah, frequently rendered "Praise ye the LORD," stands at the beginning of ten of the psalms (106, 111-113, 135, 146-150), hence called "hallelujah psalms." From its frequent occurrence it grew into a formula of praise. The Greek form of the word (alleluia) is found in Rev. 19:1, 3, 4, 6.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Hallow">
    <description>to render sacred, to consecrate (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 28:38; 29:1</reflink>). This word is from the Saxon, and properly means "to make holy." The name of God is "hallowed", i.e., is reverenced as holy (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 6:9</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Halt">
    <description>lame on the feet (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 32:31; Ps. 38:17</reflink>). To "halt between two opinions" (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 18:21</reflink>) is supposed by some to be an expression used in "allusion to birds, which hop from spray to spray, forwards and backwards." The LXX. render the expression "How long go ye lame on both knees?" The Hebrew verb rendered "halt" is used of the irregular dance ("leaped upon") around the altar (ver. 26). It indicates a lame, uncertain gait, going now in one direction, now in another, in the frenzy of wild leaping.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Ham">
    <description>warm, hot, and hence the south; also an Egyptian word meaning "black", the youngest son of Noah (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 5:32; comp. 9:22,24</reflink>). The curse pronounced by Noah against Ham, properly against Canaan his fourth son, was accomplished when the Jews subsequently exterminated the Canaanites.</description>
    <description>One of the most important facts recorded in Gen. 10 is the foundation of the earliest monarchy in Babylonia by Nimrod the grandson of Ham (6, 8, 10). The primitive Babylonian empire was thus Hamitic, and of a cognate race with the primitive inhabitants of Arabia and of Ethiopia. (<see target="x-self">See ACCAD.</see>)</description>
    <description>The race of Ham were the most energetic of all the descendants of Noah in the early times of the post-diluvian world.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Haman">
    <description>(of Persian origin), magnificent, the name of the vizier (i.e., the prime minister) of the Persian king Ahasuerus (<reflink target="XXX">Esther 3:1, etc.</reflink>). He is called an "Agagite," which seems to denote that he was descended from the royal family of the Amalekites, the bitterest enemies of the Jews, as Agag was one of the titles of the Amalekite kings. He or his parents were brought to Persia as captives taken in war. He was hanged on the gallows which he had erected for Mordecai the Jew (<reflink target="XXX">Esther 7:10</reflink>). (See ESTHER</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Hamath">
    <description>fortress, the capital of one of the kingdoms of Upper Syria of the same name, on the Orontes, in the valley of Lebanon, at the northern boundary of Palestine (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 13:21; 34:8</reflink>), at the foot of Hermon (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 13:5</reflink>) towards Damascus (<reflink target="XXX">Zech. 9:2; Jer. 49:23</reflink>). It is called "Hamath the great" in Amos 6:2, and "Hamath-zobah" in 2 Chr. 8:3.</description>
    <description>Hamath, now Hamah, had an Aramaean population, but Hittite monuments discovered there show that it must have been at one time occupied by the Hittites. It was among the conquests of the Pharaoh Thothmes III. Its king, Tou or Toi, made alliance with David (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 8:10</reflink>), and in B.C. 740 Azariah formed a league with it against Assyria. It was, however, conquered by the Assyrians, and its nineteen districts placed under Assyrian governors. In B.C. 720 it revolted under a certain Yahu-bihdi, whose name, compounded with that of the God of Israel (Yahu), perhaps shows that he was of Jewish origin. But the revolt was suppressed, and the people of Hamath were transported to Samaria (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 17:24, 30</reflink>), where they continued to worship their god Ashima. Hamah is beautifully situated on the Orontes, 32 miles north of Emesa, and 36 south of the ruins of Assamea.</description>
    <description>The kingdom of Hamath comprehended the great plain lying on both banks of the Orontes from the fountain near Riblah to Assamea on the north, and from Lebanon on the west to the desert on the east. The "entrance of Hamath" (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 34:8</reflink>), which was the north boundary of Palestine, led from the west between the north end of Lebanon and the Nusairiyeh mountains.</description>

    <description>the king's, the father of Jerahmeel, mentioned in Jer. 36:26. Some take this word as a common noun, "the king", and understand that Jerahmeel was Jehoiakim's son. Probably, however, it is to be taken as a proper name.</description>

  <item id="Hammer">
    <description>(1.) Heb. pattish, used by gold-beaters (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 41:7</reflink>) and by quarry-men (<reflink target="XXX">Jer. 23:29</reflink>). Metaphorically of Babylon (<reflink target="XXX">Jer. 50:23</reflink>) or Nebuchadnezzar.</description>
    <description>(2.) Heb. makabah, a stone-cutter's mallet (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 6:7</reflink>), or of any workman (<reflink target="XXX">Judg. 4:21; Isa. 44:12</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(3.) Heb. halmuth, a poetical word for a workman's hammer, found only in Judg. 5:26, where it denotes the mallet with which the pins of the tent of the nomad are driven into the ground.</description>
    <description>(4.) Heb. mappets, rendered "battle-axe" in Jer. 51:20. This was properly a "mace," which is thus described by Rawlinson: "The Assyrian mace was a short, thin weapon, and must either have been made of a very tough wood or (and this is more probable) of metal. It had an ornamented head, which was sometimes very beautifully modelled, and generally a strap or string at the lower end by which it could be grasped with greater firmness."</description>

  <item id="Hand">
    <description>Called by Galen "the instrument of instruments." It is the symbol of human action (<reflink target="XXX">Ps. 9:16; Job 9:30; Isa. 1:15; 1 Tim. 2:8</reflink>). Washing the hands was a symbol of innocence (<reflink target="XXX">Ps. 26:6; 73:13; Matt. 27:24</reflink>), also of sanctification (<reflink target="XXX">1 Cor. 6:11; Isa. 51:16; Ps. 24:3, 4</reflink>). In Ps. 77:2 the correct rendering is, as in the Revised Version, "My hand was stretched out," etc., instead of, as in the Authorized Version, "My sore ran in the night," etc.</description>
    <description>The right hand denoted the south, and the left the north (<reflink target="XXX">Job 23:9; 1 Sam. 23:19</reflink>). To give the right hand was a pledge of fidelity (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 10:15; Ezra 10:19</reflink>); also of submission to the victors (<reflink target="XXX">Ezek. 17:18; Jer. 50:15</reflink>). The right hand was lifted up in taking an oath (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 14:22, etc.</reflink>). The hand is frequently mentioned, particularly the right hand, as a symbol of power and strength (<reflink target="XXX">Ps. 60:5; Isa. 28:2</reflink>). To kiss the hand is an act of homage (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 19:18; Job 31:27</reflink>), and to pour water on one's hands is to serve him (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 3:11</reflink>). The hand of God is the symbol of his power: its being upon one denotes favour (<reflink target="XXX">Ezra 7:6, 28; Isa. 1:25; Luke 1:66, etc.</reflink>) or punishment (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 9:3; Judg. 2:15; Acts 13:11, etc.</reflink>). A position at the right hand was regarded as the chief place of honour and power (<reflink target="XXX">Ps. 45:9; 80:17; 110:1; Matt. 26:64</reflink>).</description>

  <item id="Hanging">
    <description>(as a punishment), a mark of infamy inflicted on the dead bodies of criminals (<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 21:23</reflink>) rather than our modern mode of punishment. Criminals were first strangled and then hanged (<reflink target="XXX">Nu. 25:4; Deut. 21:22</reflink>). (See 2 Sam. 21:6 for the practice of the Gibeonites.)</description>
    <description>Hanging (as a curtain). (1.) Heb. masak, (a) before the entrance to the court of the tabernacle (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 35:17</reflink>); (b) before the door of the tabernacle (26:36, 37); (c) before the entrance to the most holy place, called "the veil of the covering" (35:12; 39:34), as the word properly means.</description>
    <description>(2.) Heb. kelaim, tapestry covering the walls of the tabernacle (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 27:9; 35:17; Num. 3:26</reflink>) to the half of the height of the wall (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 27:18; comp. 26:16</reflink>). These hangings were fastened to pillars.</description>
    <description>(3.) Heb. bottim (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 23:7</reflink>), "hangings for the grove" (R.V., "for the Asherah"); marg., instead of "hangings," has "tents" or "houses." Such curtained structures for idolatrous worship are also alluded to in Ezek. 16:16.</description>

  <item id="Hannah">
    <description>favour, grace, one of the wives of Elkanah the Levite, and the mother of Samuel (1 Sam. 1; 2). Her home was at Ramathaim-zophim, whence she was wont every year to go to Shiloh, where the tabernacle had been pitched by Joshua, to attend the offering of sacrifices there according to the law (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 23:15; 34:18; Deut. 16:16</reflink>), probably at the feast of the Passover (<reflink target="XXX">comp. Ex. 13:10</reflink>). On occasion of one of these "yearly" visits, being grieved by reason of Peninnah's conduct toward her, she went forth alone, and kneeling before the Lord at the sanctuary she prayed inaudibly. Eli the high priest, who sat at the entrance to the holy place, observed her, and misunderstanding her character he harshly condemned her conduct (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 1:14-16</reflink>). After hearing her explanation he retracted his injurious charge and said to her, "Go in peace: and the God of Israel grant thee thy petition." Perhaps the story of the wife of Manoah was not unknown to her. Thereafter Elkanah and his family retired to their quiet home, and there, before another Passover, Hannah gave birth to a son, whom, in grateful memory of the Lord's goodness, she called Samuel, i.e., "heard of God." After the child was weaned (probably in his third year) she brought him to Shiloh into the house of the Lord, and said to Eli the aged priest, "Oh my lord, I am the woman that stood by thee here, praying unto the Lord. For this child I prayed; and the Lord hath given me my petition which I asked of him: therefore I also have granted him to the Lord; as long as he liveth he is granted to the Lord" (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 1:27, 28, R.V.</reflink>). Her gladness of heart then found vent in that remarkable prophetic song (2:1-10; comp. Luke 1:46-55) which contains the first designation of the Messiah under that name (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 2:10, "Annointed" = "Messiah"</reflink>). And so Samuel and his parents parted. He was left at Shiloh to minister "before the Lord." And each year, when they came up to Shiloh, Hannah brought to her absent child "a little coat" (Heb. meil, a term used to denote the "robe" of the ephod worn by the high priest, Ex. 28:31), a priestly robe, a long upper tunic (<reflink target="XXX">1 Chr. 15:27</reflink>), in which to minister in the tabernacle (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 2:19; 15:27; Job 2:12</reflink>). "And the child Samuel grew before the Lord." After Samuel, Hannah had three sons and two daughters.</description>

    <description>(2.) Heb. haran, i.e., "parched;" or probably from the Accadian charana, meaning "a road." A celebrated city of Western Asia, now Harran, where Abram remained, after he left Ur of the Chaldees, till his father Terah died (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 11:31, 32</reflink>), when he continued his journey into the land of Canaan. It is called "Charran" in the LXX. and in Acts 7:2. It is called the "city of Nahor" (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 24:10</reflink>), and Jacob resided here with Laban (30:43). It stood on the river Belik, an affluent of the Euphrates, about 70 miles above where it joins that river in Upper Mesopotamia or Padan-aram, and about 600 miles northwest of Ur in a direct line. It was on the caravan route between the east and west. It is afterwards mentioned among the towns taken by the king of Assyria (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 19:12; Isa. 37:12</reflink>). It was known to the Greeks and Romans under the name Carrhae.</description>

The habit of this animal is to grind its teeth and move its jaw as if it actually chewed the cud. But, like the cony (q.v.), it is not a ruminant with four stomachs, but a rodent like the squirrel, rat, etc. Moses speaks of it according to appearance. It is interdicted because, though apparently chewing the cud, it did not divide the hoof.</description>

In verses 21, 22 the Hebrew word used in _kedeshah_, i.e., a woman consecrated or devoted to prostitution in connection with the abominable worship of Asherah or Astarte, the Syrian Venus. This word is also used in Deut. 23:17; Hos. 4:14. Thus Tamar sat by the wayside as a consecrated kedeshah.</description>
    <description>It has been attempted to show that Rahab, usually called a "harlot" (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 2:1; 6:17; Heb. 11:31; James 2:25</reflink>), was only an innkeeper. This interpretation, however, cannot be maintained.</description>
    <description>Jephthah's mother is called a "strange woman" (<reflink target="XXX">Judg. 11:2</reflink>). This, however, merely denotes that she was of foreign extraction.</description>
    <description>In the time of Solomon harlots appeared openly in the streets, and he solemnly warns against association with them (<reflink target="XXX">Prov. 7:12; 9:14. See also Jer. 3:2; Ezek. 16:24, 25, 31</reflink>). The Revised Version, following the LXX., has "and the harlots washed," etc., instead of the rendering of the Authorized Version, "now they washed," of 1 Kings 22:38.</description>

    <description>(<reflink target="XXX">Judg. 4:2</reflink>) or nations, a city near Hazor in Galilee of the Gentiles, or Upper Galilee, in the north of Palestine. It was here that Jabin's great army was marshalled before it went forth into the great battlefield of Esdraelon to encounter the army of Israel, by which it was routed and put to flight (Judg. 4). It was situated "at the entrance of the pass to Esdraelon from the plain of Acre" at the base of Carmel. The name in the Hebrew is _Harosheth ha Gojim_, i.e., "the smithy of the nations;" probably, as is supposed, so called because here Jabin's iron war-chariots, armed with scythes, were made. It is identified with el-Harithiyeh.</description>

  <item id="Harp">
    <description>(Heb. kinnor), the national instrument of the Hebrews. It was invented by Jubal (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 4:21</reflink>).

It was used as an accompaniment to songs of cheerfulness as well as of praise to God (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 31:27; 1 Sam. 16:23; 2 Chr. 20:28; Ps. 33:2; 137:2</reflink>).</description>
    <description>In Solomon's time harps were made of almug-trees (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 10:11, 12</reflink>). In 1 Chr. 15:21 mention is made of "harps on the Sheminith;" Revised Version, "harps set to the Sheminith;" better perhaps "harps of eight strings." The soothing effect of the music of the harp is referred to 1 Sam. 16:16, 23; 18:10; 19:9.

  <item id="Havilah">
    <description>the sand region. (1.) A land mentioned in Gen. 2:11 rich in gold and bdellium and onyx stone.

It may perhaps be identified with the sandy tract which skirts Babylonia along the whole of its western border, stretching from the lower Euphrates to the mountains of Edom.</description>
    <description>(2.) A district in Arabia-Felix. It is uncertain whether the tribe gave its name to this region or derived its name from it, and whether it was originally a Cushite (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 10:7</reflink>) or a Joktanite tribe (10:29; comp. 25:18), or whether there were both a Cushite and a Joktanite Havilah. It is the opinion of Kalisch, however, that Havilah "in both instances designates the same country, extending at least from the Persian to the Arabian Gulf, and on account of its vast extent easily divided into two distinct parts." This opinion may be well vindicated.</description>

It is common in Syria and surrounding countries. The Hebrew word includes various species of Falconidae, with special reference perhaps to the kestrel (Falco tinnunculus), the hobby (Hypotriorchis subbuteo), and the lesser kestrel (Tin, Cenchris). The kestrel remains all the year in Palestine, but some ten or twelve other species are all migrants from the south. Of those summer visitors to Palestine special mention may be made of the Falco sacer and the Falco lanarius. (<see target="x-self">See NIGHT-HAWK.</see>)</description>

His interview with Elisha is mentioned in 2 Kings 8. The Assyrians soon after his accession to the throne came against him and defeated him with very great loss; and three years afterwards again invaded Syria, but on this occasion Hazael submitted to them. He then turned his arms against Israel, and ravaged "all the land of Gilead," etc. (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 10:33</reflink>), which he held in a degree of subjection to him (13:3-7, 22). He aimed at the subjugation also of the kingdom of Judah, when Joash obtained peace by giving him "all the gold that was found in the treasures of the house of the Lord, and in the king's house" (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 12:18; 2 Chr. 24:24</reflink>). He reigned about forty-six years (B.C.886-840), and was succeeded on the throne by his son Ben-hadad (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 13:22-25</reflink>), who on several occasions was defeated by Jehoash, the king of Israel, and compelled to restore all the land of Israel his father had taken.</description>

    <description>village or enclosure of the jackal, a city on the south border of Judah (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 15:28; Neh. 11:27</reflink>). It has been identified with the ruins of Saweh, half-way between Beersheba and Moladah.</description>

    <description>village of the horse, the same as Sansannah, one of Solomon's "chariot cities" (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 15:31; 2 Chr. 1:14</reflink>), a depot in the south border of Judah.</description>

  <item id="Hazel">
    <description>Heb. luz, (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 30:37</reflink>), a nutbearing tree. The Hebrew word is rendered in the Vulgate by amygdalinus, "the almond-tree," which is probably correct. That tree flourishes in Syria.</description>

    <description>villages, probably the name of the temporary villages in which the nomad Avites resided (<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 2:23</reflink>).</description>

  <item id="Hazeroth">
    <description>fenced enclosures consisting of "a low wall of stones in which thick bundles of thorny acacia are inserted, the tangled branches and long needle-like spikes forming a perfectly impenetrable hedge around the encampment" of tents and cattle which they sheltered. Such like enclosures abound in the wilderness of Paran, which the Israelites entered after leaving Sinai (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 11:35; 12:16; 33:17, 18</reflink>). This third encampment of the Israelites has been identified with the modern 'Ain el-Hudhera, some 40 miles north-east of Sinai. Here Miriam (q.v.), being displeased that Moses had married a Cushite wife (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 12:1</reflink>), induced Aaron to join with her in rebelling against Moses. God vindicated the authority of his "servant Moses," and Miriam was smitten with leprosy. Moses interceded for her, and she was healed (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 12:4-16</reflink>). From this encampment the Israelites marched northward across the plateau of et-Tih, and at length reached KADESH.</description>

  <item id="Hazor">
    <description>enclosed; fortified. (1.) A stronghold of the Canaanites in the mountains north of Lake Merom (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 11:1-5</reflink>). Jabin the king with his allied tribes here encountered Joshua in a great battle. Joshua gained a signal victory, which virtually completed his conquest of Canaan (11:10-13). This city was, however, afterwards rebuilt by the Canaanites, and was ruled by a king with the same hereditary name of Jabin. His army, under a noted leader of the name of Sisera, swept down upon the south, aiming at the complete subjugation of the country. This powerful army was met by the Israelites under Barak, who went forth by the advice of the prophetess Deborah. The result was one of the most remarkable victories for Israel recorded in the Old Testament (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 19:36; Judg. 4:2; 1 Sam. 12:9</reflink>). The city of Hazor was taken and occupied by the Israelites. It was fortified by Solomon to defend the entrance into the kingdom from Syria and Assyria. When Tiglath-pileser, the Assyrian king, invaded the land, this was one of the first cities he captured, carrying its inhabitants captive into Assyria (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 15:29</reflink>). It has been identified with Khurbet Harrah, 2 1/2 miles south-east of Kedesh.</description>
    <description>(2.) A city in the south of Judah (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 15:23</reflink>). The name here should probably be connected with the word following, Ithnan, HAZOR-ITHNAN instead of "Hazor and Ithnan."</description>
    <description>(3.) A district in Arabia (<reflink target="XXX">Jer. 49:28-33</reflink>), supposed by some to be Jetor, i.e., Ituraea.</description>
    <description>(4.) "Kerioth and Hezron" (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 15: 25</reflink>) should be "Kerioth-hezron" (as in the R.V.), the two names being joined together as the name of one place (e.g., like Kirjath-jearim), "the same is Hazor" (R.V.). This place has been identified with el-Kuryetein, and has been supposed to be the home of Judas Iscariot. (<see target="x-self">See KERIOTH.</see>)</description>

  <item id="He-ass">
    <description>Heb. hamor, (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 12:16</reflink>), the general designation of the donkey used for carrying burdens (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 42:26</reflink>) and for ploughing (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 30:24</reflink>). It is described in Gen. 49:14, 2 Sam. 19:26. (See ASS</description>

  <item id="Head-bands">
    <description>(Heb. kishshurim), properly girdles or belts for the waist (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 3:20, R.V., "sashes;" Jer. 2:32, rendered "attire", i.e., a girdle round the waist</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Head-dress">
    <description>Not in common use among the Hebrews. It is first mentioned in Ex. 28:40 (A.V., "bonnets;" R.V., "head-tires"). It was used especially for purposes of ornament (<reflink target="XXX">Job 29:14; Isa. 3:23; 62:3</reflink>). The Hebrew word here used, _tsaniph_, properly means a turban, folds of linen wound round the head. The Hebrew word _peer_, used in Isa. 61:3, there rendered "beauty" (A.V.) and "garland" (R.V.), is a head-dress or turban worn by females (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 3: 20, "bonnets"</reflink>), priests (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 39:28</reflink>), a bridegroom (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 61:10, "ornament;" R.V., "garland"</reflink>). Ezek. 16:10 and Jonah 2:5 are to be understood of the turban wrapped round the head. The Hebrew _shebisim_ (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 3:18</reflink>), in the Authorized Version rendered "cauls," and marg. "networks," denotes probably a kind of netted head-dress. The "horn" (Heb. keren) mentioned in 1 Sam. 2:1 is the head-dress called by the Druses of Mount Lebanon the tantura.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Heap">
    <description>When Joshua took the city of Ai (Josh. 8), he burned it and "made it an heap [Heb. tel] for ever" (8:28). The ruins of this city were for a long time sought for in vain. It has been at length, however, identified with the mound which simply bears the name of "Tel." "There are many Tels in modern Palestine, that land of Tels, each Tel with some other name attached to it to mark the former site. But the site of Ai has no other name 'unto this day.' It is simply et-Tel, 'the heap' par excellence."</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Heart">
    <description>According to the Bible, the heart is the centre not only of spiritual activity, but of all the operations of human life. "Heart" and "soul" are often used interchangeably (<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 6:5; 26:16; comp. Matt. 22:37; Mark 12:30, 33</reflink>), but this is not generally the case.</description>
    <description>The heart is the "home of the personal life," and hence a man is designated, according to his heart, wise (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 3:12, etc.</reflink>), pure (<reflink target="XXX">Ps. 24:4; Matt. 5:8, etc.</reflink>), upright and righteous (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 20:5, 6; Ps. 11:2; 78:72</reflink>), pious and good (<reflink target="XXX">Luke 8:15</reflink>), etc. In these and such passages the word "soul" could not be substituted for "heart."</description>
    <description>The heart is also the seat of the conscience (<reflink target="XXX">Rom. 2:15</reflink>). It is naturally wicked (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 8:21</reflink>), and hence it contaminates the whole life and character (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 12:34; 15:18; comp. Eccl. 8:11; Ps. 73:7</reflink>). Hence the heart must be changed, regenerated (<reflink target="XXX">Ezek. 36:26; 11:19; Ps. 51:10-14</reflink>), before a man can willingly obey God.</description>
    <description>The process of salvation begins in the heart by the believing reception of the testimony of God, while the rejection of that testimony hardens the heart (<reflink target="XXX">Ps. 95:8; Prov. 28:14; 2 Chr. 36:13</reflink>). "Hardness of heart evidences itself by light views of sin; partial acknowledgment and confession of it; pride and conceit; ingratitude; unconcern about the word and ordinances of God; inattention to divine providences; stifling convictions of conscience; shunning reproof; presumption, and general ignorance of divine things."</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Hearth">
    <description>Heb. ah (<reflink target="XXX">Jer. 36:22, 23; R.V., "brazier"</reflink>), meaning a large pot like a brazier, a portable furnace in which fire was kept in the king's winter apartment.</description>
    <description>Heb. kiyor (<reflink target="XXX">Zech. 12:6; R.V., "pan"</reflink>), a fire-pan.</description>
    <description>Heb. moqed (<reflink target="XXX">Ps. 102:3; R.V., "fire-brand"</reflink>), properly a fagot.</description>
    <description>Heb. yaqud (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 30:14</reflink>), a burning mass on a hearth.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Heath">
    <description>Heb. 'arar, (<reflink target="XXX">Jer. 17:6; 48:6</reflink>), a species of juniper called by the Arabs by the same name ('arar), the Juniperus sabina or savin. "Its gloomy, stunted appearance, with its scale-like leaves pressed close to its gnarled stem, and cropped close by the wild goats, as it clings to the rocks about Petra, gives great force to the contrast suggested by the prophet, between him that trusteth in man, naked and destitute, and the man that trusteth in the Lord, flourishing as a tree planted by the waters" (Tristram, Natural History of the Bible).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Heathen">
    <description>(Heb. plural goyum). At first the word _goyim_ denoted generally all the nations of the world (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 18:18; comp. Gal. 3:8</reflink>). The Jews afterwards became a people distinguished in a marked manner from the other _goyim_. They were a separate people (<reflink target="XXX">Lev. 20:23; 26:14-45; Deut. 28</reflink>), and the other nations, the Amorites, Hittites, etc., were the _goyim_, the heathen, with whom the Jews were forbidden to be associated in any way (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 23:7; 1 Kings 11:2</reflink>). The practice of idolatry was the characteristic of these nations, and hence the word came to designate idolaters (<reflink target="XXX">Ps. 106:47; Jer. 46:28; Lam. 1:3; Isa. 36:18</reflink>), the wicked (<reflink target="XXX">Ps. 9:5, 15, 17</reflink>).</description>
    <description>The corresponding Greek word in the New Testament, _ethne_, has similar shades of meaning. In Acts 22:21, Gal. 3:14, it denotes the people of the earth generally; and in Matt. 6:7, an idolater. In modern usage the word denotes all nations that are strangers to revealed religion.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Heave offering">
    <description>Heb. terumah, (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 29:27</reflink>) means simply an offering, a present, including all the offerings made by the Israelites as a present. This Hebrew word is frequently employed. Some of the rabbis attach to the word the meaning of elevation, and refer it to the heave offering, which consisted in presenting the offering by a motion up and down, distinguished from the wave offering, which consisted in a repeated movement in a horizontal direction, a "wave offering to the Lord as ruler of earth, a heave offering to the Lord as ruler of heaven." The right shoulder, which fell to the priests in presenting thank offerings, was called the heave shoulder (<reflink target="XXX">Lev. 7:34; Num. 6:20</reflink>). The first fruits offered in harvest-time (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 15:20, 21</reflink>) were heave offerings.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Heaven">
    <description>(1.) Definitions. The phrase "heaven and earth" is used to indicate the whole universe (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 1:1; Jer. 23:24; Acts 17:24</reflink>). According to the Jewish notion there were three heavens,</description>
    <description>(a) The firmament, as "fowls of the heaven" (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 2:19; 7:3, 23; Ps. 8:8, etc.</reflink>), "the eagles of heaven" (<reflink target="XXX">Lam. 4:19</reflink>), etc.</description>
    <description>(b) The starry heavens (<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 17:3; Jer. 8:2; Matt. 24:29</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(c) "The heaven of heavens," or "the third heaven" (<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 10:14; 1 Kings 8:27; Ps. 115:16; 148:4; 2 Cor. 12:2</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(2.) Meaning of words in the original,</description>
    <description>(a) The usual Hebrew word for "heavens" is _shamayim_, a plural form meaning "heights," "elevations" (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 1:1; 2:1</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(b) The Hebrew word _marom_ is also used (<reflink target="XXX">Ps. 68:18; 93:4; 102:19, etc.</reflink>) as equivalent to _shamayim_, "high places," "heights."</description>
    <description>(c) Heb. galgal, literally a "wheel," is rendered "heaven" in Ps. 77:18 (R.V., "whirlwind").</description>
    <description>(d) Heb. shahak, rendered "sky" (<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 33:26; Job 37:18; Ps. 18:11</reflink>), plural "clouds" (<reflink target="XXX">Job 35:5; 36:28; Ps. 68:34, marg. "heavens"</reflink>), means probably the firmament.</description>
    <description>(e) Heb. rakia is closely connected with (d), and is rendered "firmamentum" in the Vulgate, whence our "firmament" (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 1:6; Deut. 33:26, etc.</reflink>), regarded as a solid expanse.</description>
    <description>(3.) Metaphorical meaning of term. Isa. 14:13, 14; "doors of heaven" (<reflink target="XXX">Ps. 78:23</reflink>); heaven "shut" (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 8:35</reflink>); "opened" (<reflink target="XXX">Ezek. 1:1</reflink>). (See 1 Chr. 21:16.)</description>
    <description>(4.) Spiritual meaning. The place of the everlasting blessedness of the righteous; the abode of departed spirits.</description>
    <description>(a) Christ calls it his "Father's house" (<reflink target="XXX">John 14:2</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(b) It is called "paradise" (<reflink target="XXX">Luke 23:43; 2 Cor. 12:4; Rev. 2:7</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(c) "The heavenly Jerusalem" (<reflink target="XXX">Gal. 4: 26; Heb. 12:22; Rev. 3:12</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(d) The "kingdom of heaven" (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 25:1; James 2:5</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(e) The "eternal kingdom" (<reflink target="XXX">2 Pet. 1:11</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(f) The "eternal inheritance" (<reflink target="XXX">1 Pet. 1:4; Heb. 9:15</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(g) The "better country" (<reflink target="XXX">Heb. 11:14, 16</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(h) The blessed are said to "sit down with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob," and to be "in Abraham's bosom" (<reflink target="XXX">Luke 16:22; Matt. 8:11</reflink>); to "reign with Christ" (<reflink target="XXX">2 Tim. 2:12</reflink>); and to enjoy "rest" (<reflink target="XXX">Heb. 4:10, 11</reflink>).</description>
    <description>In heaven the blessedness of the righteous consists in the possession of "life everlasting," "an eternal weight of glory" (<reflink target="XXX">2 Cor. 4:17</reflink>), an exemption from all sufferings for ever, a deliverance from all evils (<reflink target="XXX">2 Cor. 5:1, 2</reflink>) and from the society of the wicked (<reflink target="XXX">2 Tim. 4:18</reflink>), bliss without termination, the "fulness of joy" for ever (<reflink target="XXX">Luke 20:36; 2 Cor. 4:16, 18; 1 Pet. 1:4; 5:10; 1 John 3:2</reflink>). The believer's heaven is not only a state of everlasting blessedness, but also a "place", a place "prepared" for them (<reflink target="XXX">John 14:2</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Heber">
    <description>passing over. (1.) Son of Beriah and grandson of Asher (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 46:17; 1 Chr. 7:31, 32</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(2.) The Kenite (<reflink target="XXX">Judg. 4:11, 17; 5:24</reflink>), a descendant of Hobab. His wife Jael received Sisera (q.v.) into her tent and then killed him.</description>
    <description>(3.) 1 Chr. 4:18.</description>
    <description>(4.) A Benjamite (<reflink target="XXX">1 Chr. 8:17</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(5.) A Gadite (5:13). (<see target="x-self">See EBER.</see>)</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Hebrew">
    <description>a name applied to the Israelites in Scripture only by one who is a foreigner (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 39:14, 17; 41:12, etc.</reflink>), or by the Israelites when they speak of themselves to foreigners (40:15; Ex. 1:19), or when spoken of an contrasted with other peoples (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 43:32; Ex. 1:3, 7, 15; Deut. 15:12</reflink>). In the New Testament there is the same contrast between Hebrews and foreigners (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 6:1; Phil. 3:5</reflink>).</description>
    <description>Derivation. (1.) The name is derived, according to some, from Eber (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 10:24</reflink>), the ancestor of Abraham. The Hebrews are "sons of Eber" (10:21).</description>
    <description>(2.) Others trace the name of a Hebrew root-word signifying "to pass over," and hence regard it as meaning "the man who passed over," viz., the Euphrates; or to the Hebrew word meaning "the region" or "country beyond," viz., the land of Chaldea. This latter view is preferred. It is the more probable origin of the designation given to Abraham coming among the Canaanites as a man from beyond the Euphrates (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 14:13</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(3.) A third derivation of the word has been suggested, viz., that it is from the Hebrew word _'abhar_, "to pass over," whence _'ebher_, in the sense of a "sojourner" or "passer through" as distinct from a "settler" in the land, and thus applies to the condition of Abraham (<reflink target="XXX">Heb. 11:13</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Hebrew language">
    <description>the language of the Hebrew nation, and that in which the Old Testament is written, with the exception of a few portions in Chaldee. In the Old Testament it is only spoken of as "Jewish" (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 18:26, 28; Isa. 36:11, 13; 2 Chr 32:18</reflink>). This name is first used by the Jews in times subsequent to the close of the Old Testament.</description>
    <description>It is one of the class of languages called Semitic, because they were chiefly spoken among the descendants of Shem.</description>
    <description>When Abraham entered Canaan it is obvious that he found the language of its inhabitants closely allied to his own. Isaiah (19:18) calls it "the language of Canaan." Whether this language, as seen in the earliest books of the Old Testament, was the very dialect which Abraham brought with him into Canaan, or whether it was the common tongue of the Canaanitish nations which he only adopted, is uncertain; probably the latter opinion is the correct one. For the thousand years between Moses and the Babylonian exile the Hebrew language underwent little or no modification. It preserves all through a remarkable uniformity of structure. From the first it appears in its full maturity of development. But through intercourse with Damascus, Assyria, and Babylon, from the time of David, and more particularly from the period of the Exile, it comes under the influence of the Aramaic idiom, and this is seen in the writings which date from this period. It was never spoken in its purity by the Jews after their return from Babylon. They now spoke Hebrew with a large admixture of Aramaic or Chaldee, which latterly became the predominant element in the national language.</description>
    <description>The Hebrew of the Old Testament has only about six thousand words, all derived from about five hundred roots. Hence the same word has sometimes a great variety of meanings. So long as it was a living language, and for ages after, only the consonants of the words were written. This also has been a source of difficulty in interpreting certain words, for the meaning varies according to the vowels which may be supplied. The Hebrew is one of the oldest languages of which we have any knowledge. It is essentially identical with the Phoenician language. (<see target="x-self">See MOABITE STONE.</see>) The Semitic languages, to which class the Hebrew and Phoenician belonged, were spoken over a very wide area: in Babylonia, Mesopotamia, Syria, Palestine and Arabia, in all the countries from the Mediterranean to the borders of Assyria, and from the mountains of Armenia to the Indian Ocean. The rounded form of the letters, as seen in the Moabite stone, was probably that in which the ancient Hebrew was written down to the time of the Exile, when the present square or Chaldean form was adopted.</description>

  <item id="Hebrew of the Hebrews">
    <description>one whose parents are both Hebrews (<reflink target="XXX">Phil. 3:5; 2 Cor. 11:22</reflink>); a genuine Hebrew.</description>

  </item>
  <item id="Hebrews, Epistle to">
    <description>(1.) Its canonicity. All the results of critical and historical research to which this epistle has been specially subjected abundantly vindicate its right to a place in the New Testament canon among the other inspired books.</description>
    <description>(2.) Its authorship. A considerable variety of opinions on this subject has at different times been advanced. Some have maintained that its author was Silas, Paul's companion. Others have attributed it to Clement of Rome, or Luke, or Barnabas, or some unknown Alexandrian Christian, or Apollos; but the conclusion which we think is best supported, both from internal and external evidence, is that Paul was its author. There are, no doubt, many difficulties in the way of accepting it as Paul's; but we may at least argue with Calvin that there can be no difficulty in the way of "embracing it without controversy as one of the apostolical epistles."</description>
    <description>(3.) Date and place of writing. It was in all probability written at Rome, near the close of Paul's two years' imprisonment (<reflink target="XXX">Heb. 13:19,24</reflink>). It was certainly written before the destruction of Jerusalem (13:10).</description>
    <description>(4.) To whom addressed. Plainly it was intended for Jewish converts to the faith of the gospel, probably for the church at Jerusalem. The subscription of this epistle is, of course, without authority. In this case it is incorrect, for obviously Timothy could not be the bearer of it (13:23).</description>
    <description>(5.) Its design was to show the true end and meaning of the Mosaic system, and its symbolical and transient character. It proves that the Levitical priesthood was a "shadow" of that of Christ, and that the legal sacrifices prefigured the great and all-perfect sacrifice he offered for us. It explains that the gospel was designed, not to modify the law of Moses, but to supersede and abolish it. Its teaching was fitted, as it was designed, to check that tendency to apostatize from Christianity and to return to Judaism which now showed itself among certain Jewish Christians. The supreme authority and the transcendent glory of the gospel are clearly set forth, and in such a way as to strengthen and confirm their allegiance to Christ.</description>
    <description>(6.) It consists of two parts: (a) doctrinal (1-10:18), (b) and practical (10:19-ch. 13). There are found in it many references to portions of the Old Testament. It may be regarded as a treatise supplementary to the Epistles to the Romans and Galatians, and as an inspired commentary on the book of Leviticus.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Hebron">
    <description>a community; alliance. (1.) A city in the south end of the valley of Eshcol, about midway between Jerusalem and Beersheba, from which it is distant about 20 miles in a straight line. It was built "seven years before Zoan in Egypt" (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 13:18; Num. 13:22</reflink>). It still exists under the same name, and is one of the most ancient cities in the world. Its earlier name was Kirjath-arba (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 23:2; Josh. 14:15; 15:3</reflink>). But "Hebron would appear to have been the original name of the city, and it was not till after Abraham's stay there that it received the name Kirjath-arba, who [i.e., Arba] was not the founder but the conqueror of the city, having led thither the tribe of the Anakim, to which he belonged. It retained this name till it came into the possession of Caleb, when the Israelites restored the original name Hebron" (Keil, Com.). The name of this city does not occur in any of the prophets or in the New Testament. It is found about forty times in the Old. It was the favorite home of Abraham. Here he pitched his tent under the oaks of Mamre, by which name it came afterwards to be known; and here Sarah died, and was buried in the cave of Machpelah (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 23:17-20</reflink>), which he bought from Ephron the Hittite. From this place the patriarch departed for Egypt by way of Beersheba (37:14; 46:1). It was taken by Joshua and given to Caleb (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 10:36, 37; 12:10; 14:13</reflink>). It became a Levitical city and a city of refuge (20:7; 21:11). When David became king of Judah this was his royal residence, and he resided here for seven and a half years (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 5:5</reflink>); and here he was anointed as king over all Israel (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 2:1-4, 11; 1 Kings 2:11</reflink>).

Succession to property was a matter of right and not of favour. Christ is the "heir of all things" (<reflink target="XXX">Heb. 1:2; Col. 1:15</reflink>).

  <item id="Helkath-hazzurim">
    <description>plot of the sharp blades, or the field of heroes, (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 2:16</reflink>). After the battle of Gilboa, so fatal to Saul and his house, David, as divinely directed, took up his residence in Hebron, and was there anointed king over Judah. Among the fugitives from Gilboa was Ish-bosheth, the only surviving son of Saul, whom Abner, Saul's uncle, took across the Jordan to Mahanaim, and there had him proclaimed king. Abner gathered all the forces at his command and marched to Gibeon, with the object of wresting Judah from David. Joab had the command of David's army of trained men, who encamped on the south of the pool, which was on the east of the hill on which the town of Gibeon was built, while Abner's army lay on the north of the pool. Abner proposed that the conflict should be decided by twelve young men engaging in personal combat on either side. So fiercely did they encounter each other that "they caught every man his fellow by the head, and thrust his sword in his fellow's side; so they fell down together: wherefore that place was called Helkath-hazzurim." The combat of the champions was thus indecisive, and there followed a severe general engagement between the two armies, ending in the total rout of the Israelites under Abner. The general result of this battle was that "David waxed stronger and stronger, and the house of Saul waxed weaker and weaker" (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 3:1</reflink>). (<see target="x-self">See GIBEON.</see>)</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Hell">
    <description>derived from the Saxon helan, to cover; hence the covered or the invisible place. In Scripture there are three words so rendered:</description>
    <description>(1.) Sheol, occurring in the Old Testament sixty-five times. This word sheol is derived from a root-word meaning "to ask," "demand;" hence insatiableness (<reflink target="XXX">Prov. 30:15, 16</reflink>). It is rendered "grave" thirty-one times (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 37:35; 42:38; 44:29, 31; 1 Sam. 2:6, etc.</reflink>). The Revisers have retained this rendering in the historical books with the original word in the margin, while in the poetical books they have reversed this rule.</description>
    <description>In thirty-one cases in the Authorized Version this word is rendered "hell," the place of disembodied spirits. The inhabitants of sheol are "the congregation of the dead" (<reflink target="XXX">Prov. 21:16</reflink>). It is (a) the abode of the wicked (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 16:33; Job 24:19; Ps. 9:17; 31:17, etc.</reflink>); (b) of the good (<reflink target="XXX">Ps. 16:10; 30:3; 49:15; 86:13, etc.</reflink>).</description>
    <description>Sheol is described as deep (<reflink target="XXX">Job 11:8</reflink>), dark (10:21, 22), with bars (17:16). The dead "go down" to it (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 16:30, 33; Ezek. 31:15, 16, 17</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(2.) The Greek word hades of the New Testament has the same scope of signification as sheol of the Old Testament. It is a prison (<reflink target="XXX">1 Pet. 3:19</reflink>), with gates and bars and locks (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 16:18; Rev. 1:18</reflink>), and it is downward (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 11:23; Luke 10:15</reflink>).</description>
    <description>The righteous and the wicked are separated. The blessed dead are in that part of hades called paradise (<reflink target="XXX">Luke 23:43</reflink>). They are also said to be in Abraham's bosom (<reflink target="XXX">Luke 16:22</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(3.) Gehenna, in most of its occurrences in the Greek New Testament, designates the place of the lost (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 23:33</reflink>). The fearful nature of their condition there is described in various figurative expressions (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 8:12; 13:42; 22:13; 25:30; Luke 16:24, etc.</reflink>).

    <description>In Egypt herdsmen were probably of the lowest caste. Some of Joseph's brethren were made rulers over Pharaoh's cattle (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 47:6, 17</reflink>). The Israelites were known in Egypt as "keepers of cattle;" and when they left it they took their flocks and herds with them (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 12:38</reflink>). Both David and Saul came from "following the herd" to occupy the throne (1 Sam. 9; 11:5; Ps. 78:70). David's herd-masters were among his chief officers of state. The daughters also of wealthy chiefs were wont to tend the flocks of the family (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 29:9; Ex. 2:16</reflink>). The "chief of the herdsmen" was in the time of the monarchy an officer of high rank (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 21:7; comp. 1 Chr. 27:29</reflink>). The herdsmen lived in tents (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 38:12; Jer. 6:3</reflink>); and there were folds for the cattle (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 32:16</reflink>), and watch-towers for the herdsmen, that he might therefrom observe any coming danger (<reflink target="XXX">Micah 4:8; Nah. 3:8</reflink>).</description>

    <description>(2.) Isa. 19:18, marg. (<see target="x-self">See ON.</see>)</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Heresy">
    <description>from a Greek word signifying (1) a choice, (2) the opinion chosen, and (3) the sect holding the opinion. In the Acts of the Apostles (5:17; 15:5; 24:5, 14; 26:5) it denotes a sect, without reference to its character. Elsewhere, however, in the New Testament it has a different meaning attached to it. Paul ranks "heresies" with crimes and seditions (<reflink target="XXX">Gal. 5:20</reflink>). This word also denotes divisions or schisms in the church (<reflink target="XXX">1 Cor. 11:19</reflink>). In Titus 3:10 a "heretical person" is one who follows his own self-willed "questions," and who is to be avoided. Heresies thus came to signify self-chosen doctrines not emanating from God (<reflink target="XXX">2 Pet. 2:1</reflink>).</description>

  <item id="Hermon">
    <description>a peak, the eastern prolongation of the Anti-Lebanon range, reaching to the height of about 9,200 feet above the Mediterranean. It marks the north boundary of Palestine (<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 3:8, 4:48; Josh. 11:3, 17; 13:11; 12:1</reflink>), and is seen from a great distance. It is about 40 miles north of the Sea of Galilee. It is called "the Hermonites" (<reflink target="XXX">Ps. 42:6</reflink>) because it has more than one summit. The Sidonians called it Sirion, and the Amorites Shenir (<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 3:9; Cant. 4:8</reflink>). It is also called Baal-hermon (<reflink target="XXX">Judg. 3:3; 1 Chr. 5:23</reflink>) and Sion (<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 4:48</reflink>). There is every probability that one of its three summits was the scene of the transfiguration (q.v.). The "dew of Hermon" is referred to (<reflink target="XXX">Ps. 89: 12</reflink>). Its modern name is Jebel-esh-Sheikh, "the chief mountain." It is one of the most conspicuous mountains in Palestine or Syria. "In whatever part of Palestine the Israelite turned his eye northward, Hermon was there, terminating the view. From the plain along the coast, from the Jordan valley, from the heights of Moab and Gilead, from the plateau of Bashan, the pale, blue, snow-capped cone forms the one feature in the northern horizon."</description>
    <description>Our Lord and his disciples climbed this "high mountain apart" one day, and remained on its summit all night, "weary after their long and toilsome ascent." During the night "he was transfigured before them; and his face did shine as the sun." The next day they descended to Caesarea Philippi.</description>

  <item id="Herod Agrippa I">
    <description>son of Aristobulus and Bernice, and grandson of Herod the Great. He was made tetrarch of the provinces formerly held by Lysanias II., and ultimately possessed the entire kingdom of his grandfather, Herod the Great, with the title of king. He put the apostle James the elder to death, and cast Peter into prison (<reflink target="XXX">Luke 3:1; Acts 12:1-19</reflink>). On the second day of a festival held in honour of the emperor Claudius, he appeared in the great theatre of Caesarea. "The king came in clothed in magnificent robes, of which silver was the costly brilliant material. It was early in the day, and the sun's rays fell on the king, so that the eyes of the beholders were dazzled with the brightness which surrounded him. Voices here and there from the crowd exclaimed that it was the apparition of something divine. And when he spoke and made an oration to them, they gave a shout, saying, 'It is the voice of a god, and not of a man.' But in the midst of this idolatrous ostentation an angel of God suddenly smote him. He was carried out of the theatre a dying man." He died (A.D. 44) of the same loathsome malady which slew his grandfather (<reflink target="XXX">Acts. 12:21-23</reflink>), in the fifty-fourth year of his age, having reigned four years as tetrarch and three as king over the whole of Palestine. After his death his kingdom came under the control of the prefect of Syria, and Palestine was now fully incorporated with the empire.</description>

    <description>(<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 2:1-22; Luke 1:5; Acts 23:35</reflink>), the son of Antipater, an Idumaean, and Cypros, an Arabian of noble descent. In the year B.C. 47 Julius Caesar made Antipater, a "wily Idumaean," procurator of Judea, who divided his territories between his four sons, Galilee falling to the lot of Herod, who was afterwards appointed tetrarch of Judea by Mark Antony (B.C. 40), and also king of Judea by the Roman senate.</description>
    <description>He was of a stern and cruel disposition. "He was brutish and a stranger to all humanity." Alarmed by the tidings of one "born King of the Jews," he sent forth and "slew all the children that were in Bethlehem, and in all the coasts thereof, from two years old and under" (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 2:16</reflink>). He was fond of splendour, and lavished great sums in rebuilding and adorning the cities of his empire. He rebuilt the city of Caesarea (q.v.) on the coast, and also the city of Samaria (q.v.), which he called Sebaste, in honour of Augustus. He restored the ruined temple of Jerusalem, a work which was begun B.C. 20, but was not finished till after Herod's death, probably not till about A.D. 50 (<reflink target="XXX">John 2:20</reflink>). After a troubled reign of thirty-seven years, he died at Jericho amid great agonies both of body and mind, B.C. 4, i.e., according to the common chronology, in the year in which Jesus was born.</description>
    <description>After his death his kingdom was divided among three of his sons. Of these, Philip had the land east of Jordan, between Caesarea Philippi and Bethabara, Antipas had Galilee and Peraea, while Archelaus had Judea and Samaria.</description>

While residing at Rome with her husband Herod Philip I. and her daughter, Herod Antipas fell in with her during one of his journeys to that city. She consented to leave her husband and become his wife. Some time after, Herod met John the Baptist, who boldly declared the marriage to be unlawful. For this he was "cast into prison," in the castle probably of Machaerus (q.v.), and was there subsequently beheaded.</description>

    <description>whom Jehovah has strengthened. (1.) Son of Ahaz (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 18:1; 2 Chr. 29:1</reflink>), whom he succeeded on the throne of the kingdom of Judah. He reigned twenty-nine years (B.C. 726-697). The history of this king is contained in 2 Kings 18:20, Isa. 36-39, and 2 Chr. 29-32. He is spoken of as a great and good king. In public life he followed the example of his great-granfather Uzziah. He set himself to abolish idolatry from his kingdom, and among other things which he did for this end, he destroyed the "brazen serpent," which had been removed to Jerusalem, and had become an object of idolatrous worship (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 21:9</reflink>). A great reformation was wrought in the kingdom of Judah in his day (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 18:4; 2 Chr. 29:3-36</reflink>).</description>
    <description>On the death of Sargon and the accession of his son Sennacherib to the throne of Assyria, Hezekiah refused to pay the tribute which his father had paid, and "rebelled against the king of Assyria, and served him not," but entered into a league with Egypt (Isa. 30; 31; 36:6-9). This led to the invasion of Judah by Sennacherib (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 18:13-16</reflink>), who took forty cities, and besieged Jerusalem with mounds. Hezekiah yielded to the demands of the Assyrian king, and agreed to pay him three hundred talents of silver and thirty of gold (18:14).</description>
    <description>But Sennacherib dealt treacherously with Hezekiah (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 33:1</reflink>), and a second time within two years invaded his kingdom (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 18:17; 2 Chr. 32:9; Isa. 36</reflink>). This invasion issued in the destruction of Sennacherib's army. Hezekiah prayed to God, and "that night the angel of the Lord went out, and smote in the camp of the Assyrians 185,000 men." Sennacherib fled with the shattered remnant of his forces to Nineveh, where, seventeen years after, he was assassinated by his sons Adrammelech and Sharezer (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 19:37</reflink>).

He closed his days in peace and prosperity, and was succeeded by his son Manasseh. He was buried in the "chiefest of the sepulchres of the sons of David" (<reflink target="XXX">2 Chr. 32:27-33</reflink>).

It was on a mountain in Gilead that Laban and Jacob offered sacrifices (31:54). After the Israelites entered the Promised Land they were strictly enjoined to overthrow the high places of the Canaanites (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 34:13; Deut. 7:5; 12:2, 3</reflink>), and they were forbidden to worship the Lord on high places (<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 12:11-14</reflink>), and were enjoined to use but one altar for sacrifices (<reflink target="XXX">Lev. 17:3, 4; Deut. 12; 16:21</reflink>). The injunction against high places was, however, very imperfectly obeyed, and we find again and again mention made of them (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 14:4; 15:4, 35:2 Chr. 15:17, etc.</reflink>).</description>

  <item id="High priest">
    <description>Aaron was the first who was solemnly set apart to this office (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 29:7; 30:23; Lev. 8:12</reflink>). He wore a peculiar dress, which on his death passed to his successor in office (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 29:29, 30</reflink>). Besides those garments which he wore in common with all priests, there were four that were peculiar to himself as high priest:</description>
    <description>(1.) The "robe" of the ephod, all of blue, of "woven work," worn immediately under the ephod. It was without seam or sleeves. The hem or skirt was ornamented with pomegranates and golden bells, seventy-two of each in alternate order. The sounding of the bells intimated to the people in the outer court the time when the high priest entered into the holy place to burn incense before the Lord (Ex. 28).</description>
    <description>(2.) The "ephod" consisted of two parts, one of which covered the back and the other the breast, which were united by the "curious girdle." It was made of fine twined linen, and ornamented with gold and purple. Each of the shoulder-straps was adorned with a precious stone, on which the names of the twelve tribes were engraved. This was the high priest's distinctive vestment (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 2:28; 14:3; 21:9; 23:6, 9; 30:7</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(3.) The "breastplate of judgment" (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 28:6-12, 25-28; 39:2-7</reflink>) of "cunning work." It was a piece of cloth doubled, of one span square. It bore twelve precious stones, set in four rows of three in a row, which constituted the Urim and Thummim (q.v.). These stones had the names of the twelve tribes engraved on them. When the high priest, clothed with the ephod and the breastplate, inquired of the Lord, answers were given in some mysterious way by the Urim and Thummim (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 14:3, 18, 19; 23:2, 4, 9, 11,12; 28:6; 2 Sam. 5:23</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(4.) The "mitre," or upper turban, a twisted band of eight yards of fine linen coiled into a cap, with a gold plate in front, engraved with "Holiness to the Lord," fastened to it by a ribbon of blue.</description>
    <description>To the high priest alone it was permitted to enter the holy of holies, which he did only once a year, on the great Day of Atonement, for "the way into the holiest of all was not yet made manifest" (Heb. 9; 10). Wearing his gorgeous priestly vestments, he entered the temple before all the people, and then, laying them aside and assuming only his linen garments in secret, he entered the holy of holies alone, and made expiation, sprinkling the blood of the sin offering on the mercy seat, and offering up incense. Then resuming his splendid robes, he reappeared before the people (Lev. 16). Thus the wearing of these robes came to be identified with the Day of Atonement.</description>
    <description>The office, dress, and ministration of the high priest were typical of the priesthood of our Lord (<reflink target="XXX">Heb. 4:14; 7:25; 9:12, etc.</reflink>).</description>
    <description>It is supposed that there were in all eighty-three high priests, beginning with Aaron (B.C. 1657) and ending with Phannias (A.D. 70). At its first institution the office of high priest was held for life (but comp. 1 Kings 2:27), and was hereditary in the family of Aaron (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 3:10</reflink>). The office continued in the line of Eleazar, Aaron's eldest son, for two hundred and ninety-six years, when it passed to Eli, the first of the line of Ithamar, who was the fourth son of Aaron. In this line it continued to Abiathar, whom Solomon deposed, and appointed Zadok, of the family of Eleazar, in his stead (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 2:35</reflink>), in which it remained till the time of the Captivity. After the Return, Joshua, the son of Josedek, of the family of Eleazar, was appointed to this office. After him the succession was changed from time to time under priestly or political influences.</description>

    <description>(6.) The high priest in the reign of Josiah (<reflink target="XXX">1 Chr. 6:13; Ezra 7:1</reflink>). To him and his deputy (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 23:5</reflink>), along with the ordinary priests and the Levites who had charge of the gates, was entrusted the purification of the temple in Jerusalem. While this was in progress, he discovered in some hidden corner of the building a book called the "book of the law" (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 22:8</reflink>) and the "book of the covenant" (23:2). Some have supposed that this "book" was nothing else than the original autograph copy of the Pentateuch written by Moses (<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 31:9-26</reflink>). This remarkable discovery occurred in the eighteenth year of Josiah's reign (B.C. 624), a discovery which permanently affected the whole subsequent history of Israel.

In Syria, and especially in the Hauran, there are many ancient doors, consisting of stone slabs with pivots carved out of the same piece inserted in sockets above and below, and fixed during the building of the house" (<reflink target="XXX">Prov. 26:14</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Hinnom">
    <description>a deep, narrow ravine separating Mount Zion from the so-called "Hill of Evil Counsel." It took its name from "some ancient hero, the son of Hinnom." It is first mentioned in Josh. 15:8. It had been the place where the idolatrous Jews burned their children alive to Moloch and Baal. A particular part of the valley was called Tophet, or the "fire-stove," where the children were burned. After the Exile, in order to show their abhorrence of the locality, the Jews made this valley the receptacle of the offal of the city, for the destruction of which a fire was, as is supposed, kept constantly burning there.</description>
    <description>The Jews associated with this valley these two ideas, (1) that of the sufferings of the victims that had there been sacrificed; and (2) that of filth and corruption. It became thus to the popular mind a symbol of the abode of the wicked hereafter. It came to signify hell as the place of the wicked. "It might be shown by infinite examples that the Jews expressed hell, or the place of the damned, by this word. The word Gehenna [the Greek contraction of Hinnom] was never used in the time of Christ in any other sense than to denote the place of future punishment." About this fact there can be no question. In this sense the word is used eleven times in our Lord's discourses (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 23:33; Luke 12:5; Matt. 5:22, etc.</reflink>).</description>

  <item id="Hiram">
    <description>high-born. (1.) Generally "Huram," one of the sons of Bela (<reflink target="XXX">1 Chr. 8:5</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(2.) Also "Huram" and "Horam," king of Tyre. He entered into an alliance with David, and assisted him in building his palace by sending him able workmen, and also cedar-trees and fir-trees from Lebanon (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 5:11; 1 Chr. 14:1</reflink>). After the death of David he entered into a similar alliance with Solomon, and assisted him greatly in building the temple (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 5:1; 9:11; 2 Chr. 2:3</reflink>). He also took part in Solomon's traffic to the Eastern Seas (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 9:27; 10:11; 2 Chr. 8:18; 9:10</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(3.) The "master workman" whom Hiram sent to Solomon. He was the son of a widow of Dan, and of a Tyrian father. In 2 Chr. 2:13 "Huram my father" should be Huram Abi, the word "Abi" (rendered here "my father") being regarded as a proper name, or it may perhaps be a title of distinction given to Huram, and equivalent to "master." (Comp. 1 Kings 7:14; 2 Chr. 4:16.) He cast the magnificent brazen works for Solomon's temple in clay-beds in the valley of Jordan, between Succoth and Zarthan.</description>

    <description>to express contempt (<reflink target="XXX">Job 27:23</reflink>). The destruction of the temple is thus spoken of (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 9:8</reflink>). Zechariah (10:8) speaks of the Lord gathering the house of Judah as it were with a hiss: "I will hiss for them." This expression may be "derived from the noise made to attract bees in hiving, or from the sound naturally made to attract a person's attention."</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Hittites">
    <description>Palestine and Syria appear to have been originally inhabited by three different tribes. (1.) The Semites, living on the east of the isthmus of Suez. They were nomadic and pastoral tribes. (2.) The Phoenicians, who were merchants and traders; and (3.) the Hittites, who were the warlike element of this confederation of tribes. They inhabited the whole region between the Euphrates and Damascus, their chief cities being Carchemish on the Euphrates, and Kadesh, now Tell Neby Mendeh, in the Orontes valley, about six miles south of the Lake of Homs. These Hittites seem to have risen to great power as a nation, as for a long time they were formidable rivals of the Egyptian and Assyrian empires. In the book of Joshua they always appear as the dominant race to the north of Galilee.</description>
    <description>Somewhere about the twenty-third century B.C. the Syrian confederation, led probably by the Hittites, arched against Lower Egypt, which they took possession of, making Zoan their capital. Their rulers were the Hyksos, or shepherd kings. They were at length finally driven out of Egypt. Rameses II. sought vengeance against the "vile Kheta," as he called them, and encountered and defeated them in the great battle of Kadesh, four centuries after Abraham. (<see target="x-self">See JOSHUA.</see>)</description>
    <description>They are first referred to in Scripture in the history of Abraham, who bought from Ephron the Hittite the field and the cave of Machpelah (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 15:20: 23:3-18</reflink>). They were then settled at Kirjath-arba. From this tribe Esau took his first two wives (26:34; 36:2).</description>
    <description>They are afterwards mentioned in the usual way among the inhabitants of the Promised Land (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 23:28</reflink>). They were closely allied to the Amorites, and are frequently mentioned along with them as inhabiting the mountains of Palestine. When the spies entered the land they seem to have occupied with the Amorites the mountain region of Judah (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 13:29</reflink>). They took part with the other Canaanites against the Israelites (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 9:1; 11:3</reflink>).</description>
    <description>After this there are few references to them in Scripture. Mention is made of "Ahimelech the Hittite" (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 26:6</reflink>), and of "Uriah the Hittite," one of David's chief officers (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 23:39; 1 Chr. 11:41</reflink>). In the days of Solomon they were a powerful confederation in the north of Syria, and were ruled by "kings." They are met with after the Exile still a distinct people (<reflink target="XXX">Ezra 9:1; comp. Neh. 13:23-28</reflink>).</description>
    <description>The Hebrew merchants exported horses from Egypt not only for the kings of Israel, but also for the Hittites (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 10:28, 29</reflink>). From the Egyptian monuments we learn that "the Hittites were a people with yellow skins and 'Mongoloid' features, whose receding foreheads, oblique eyes, and protruding upper jaws are represented as faithfully on their own monuments as they are on those of Egypt, so that we cannot accuse the Egyptian artists of caricaturing their enemies. The Amorites, on the contrary, were a tall and handsome people. They are depicted with white skins, blue eyes, and reddish hair, all the characteristics, in fact, of the white race" (Sayce's The Hittites). The original seat of the Hittite tribes was the mountain ranges of Taurus. They belonged to Asia Minor, and not to Syria.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Hivites">
    <description>one of the original tribes scattered over Palestine, from Hermon to Gibeon in the south. The name is interpreted as "midlanders" or "villagers" (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 10:17; 1 Chr. 1:15</reflink>). They were probably a branch of the Hittites. At the time of Jacob's return to Canaan, Hamor the Hivite was the "prince of the land" (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 24:2-28</reflink>).</description>
    <description>They are next mentioned during the Conquest (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 9:7; 11:19</reflink>). They principally inhabited the northern confines of Western Palestine (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 11:3; Judg. 3:3</reflink>). A remnant of them still existed in the time of Solomon (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 9:20</reflink>).</description>

  <item id="Holy of holies">
    <description>the second or interior portion of the tabernacle. It was left in total darkness. No one was permitted to enter it except the high priest, and that only once a year. It contained the ark of the covenant only (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 25:10-16</reflink>). It was in the form of a perfect cube of 20 cubits. (<see target="x-self">See TABERNACLE.</see>)</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Holy place">
    <description>one of the two portions into which the tabernacle was divided (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 26:31; 37:17-25; Heb. 9:2</reflink>). It was 20 cubits long and 10 in height and breadth. It was illuminated by the golden candlestick, as it had no opening to admit the light. It contained the table of showbread (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 25:23-29</reflink>) and the golden altar of incense (30:1-11). It was divided from the holy of holies by a veil of the most costly materials and the brightest colours.</description>
    <description>The arrangement of the temple (q.v.) was the same in this respect. In it the walls of hewn stone were wainscotted with cedar and overlaid with gold, and adorned with beautiful carvings. It was entered from the porch by folding doors overlaid with gold and richly embossed. Outside the holy place stood the great tank or "sea" of molten brass, supported by twelve oxen, three turned each way, capable of containing two thousand baths of water. Besides this there were ten lavers and the brazen altar of burnt sacrifice.</description>

  <item id="Honey">
    <description>(1.) Heb. ya'ar, occurs only 1 Sam. 14:25, 27, 29; Cant. 5:1, where it denotes the honey of bees. Properly the word signifies a forest or copse, and refers to honey found in woods.</description>
    <description>(2.) Nopheth, honey that drops (<reflink target="XXX">Ps. 19:10; Prov. 5:3; Cant. 4:11</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(3.) Debash denotes bee-honey (<reflink target="XXX">Judg. 14:8</reflink>); but also frequently a vegetable honey distilled from trees (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 43:11; Ezek. 27:17</reflink>). In these passages it may probably mean "dibs," or syrup of grapes, i.e., the juice of ripe grapes boiled down to one-third of its bulk.</description>
    <description>(4.) Tsuph, the cells of the honey-comb full of honey (<reflink target="XXX">Prov. 16:24; Ps. 19:10</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(5.) "Wild honey" (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 3:4</reflink>) may have been the vegetable honey distilled from trees, but rather was honey stored by bees in rocks or in trees (<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 32:13; Ps. 81:16; 1 Sam. 14:25-29</reflink>).</description>
    <description>Canaan was a "land flowing with milk and honey" (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 3:8</reflink>). Milk and honey were among the chief dainties in the earlier ages, as they are now among the Bedawin; and butter and honey are also mentioned among articles of food (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 7:15</reflink>). The ancients used honey instead of sugar (<reflink target="XXX">Ps. 119:103; Prov. 24:13</reflink>); but when taken in great quantities it caused nausea, a fact referred to in Prov. 25:16, 17 to inculcate moderation in pleasures. Honey and milk also are put for sweet discourse (<reflink target="XXX">Cant. 4:11</reflink>).</description>

  <item id="Hoof">
    <description>a cleft hoof as of neat cattle (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 10:26; Ezek. 32:13</reflink>); hence also of the horse, though not cloven (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 5:28</reflink>). The "parting of the hoof" is one of the distinctions between clean and unclean animals (<reflink target="XXX">Lev. 11:3; Deut. 14:7</reflink>).</description>

  <item id="Hook">
    <description>(1.)

"The Orientals make use of this contrivance for curbing their work-beasts...When a beast becomes unruly they have only to draw the cord on one side, which, by stopping his breath, punishes him so effectually that after a few repetitions he fails not to become quite tractable whenever he begins to feel it" (Michaelis). So God's agents are never beyond his control.</description>

    <description>(3.) Vav, a "peg" on which the curtains of the tabernacle were hung (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 26:32</reflink>).</description>

  </item>
  <item id="Hope">
    <description>one of the three main elements of Christian character (<reflink target="XXX">1 Cor. 13:13</reflink>). It is joined to faith and love, and is opposed to seeing or possessing (<reflink target="XXX">Rom. 8:24; 1 John 3:2</reflink>). "Hope is an essential and fundamental element of Christian life, so essential indeed, that, like faith and love, it can itself designate the essence of Christianity (<reflink target="XXX">1 Pet. 3:15; Heb. 10:23</reflink>). In it the whole glory of the Christian vocation is centred (<reflink target="XXX">Eph. 1:18; 4:4</reflink>)." Unbelievers are without this hope (<reflink target="XXX">Eph. 2:12; 1 Thess. 4:13</reflink>). Christ is the actual object of the believer's hope, because it is in his second coming that the hope of glory will be fulfilled (<reflink target="XXX">1 Tim. 1:1; Col. 1:27; Titus 2:13</reflink>). It is spoken of as "lively", i.e., a living, hope, a hope not frail and perishable, but having a perennial life (<reflink target="XXX">1 Pet. 1:3</reflink>). In Rom. 5:2 the "hope" spoken of is probably objective, i.e., "the hope set before us," namely, eternal life (<reflink target="XXX">comp. 12:12</reflink>). In 1 John 3:3 the expression "hope in him" ought rather to be, as in the Revised Version, "hope on him," i.e., a hope based on God.</description>

  <item id="Hophni">
    <description>pugilist or client, one of the two sons of Eli, the high priest (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 1:3; 2:34</reflink>), who, because he was "very old," resigned to them the active duties of his office. By their scandalous conduct they brought down a curse on their father's house (2:22, 12-27, 27-36; 3:11-14). For their wickedness they were called "sons of Belial," i.e., worthless men (2:12). They both perished in the disastrous battle with the Philistines at Aphek (4:11). (<see target="x-self">See PHINEHAS.</see>)</description>

  <item id="Hor">
    <description>mountain. (1.) One of the mountains of the chain of Seir or Edom, on the confines of Idumea (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 20:22-29; 33:37</reflink>). It was one of the stations of the Israelites in the wilderness (33:37), which they reached in the circuitous route they were obliged to take because the Edomites refused them a passage through their territory. It was during the encampment here that Aaron died (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 33:37-41</reflink>). (<see target="x-self">See AARON.</see>) The Israelites passed this mountain several times in their wanderings. It bears the modern name of Jebel Harun, and is the highest and most conspicious of the whole range. It stands about midway between the Dead Sea and the Elanitic gulf. It has two summits, in the hallow between which it is supposed that Aaron died. Others, however, suppose that this mountain is the modern Jebel Madurah, on the opposite, i.e., the western, side of the Arabah.</description>
    <description>(2.) One of the marks of the northern boundary of Palestine (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 34:7, 8</reflink>). Nowhere else mentioned. Perhaps it is one of the peaks of Lebanon.</description>

  <item id="Horeb">
    <description>desert or mountain of the dried-up ground, a general name for the whole mountain range of which Sinai was one of the summits (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 3:1; 17:6; 33:6; Ps. 106:19, etc.</reflink>). The modern name of the whole range is Jebel Musa. It is a huge mountain block, about 2 miles long by about 1 in breadth, with a very spacious plain at its north-east end, called the Er Rahah, in which the Israelites encamped for nearly a whole year.

  <item id="Horites">
    <description>cave-men, a race of Troglodytes who dwelt in the limestone caves which abounded in Edom. Their ancestor was "Seir," who probably gave his name to the district where he lived. They were a branch of the Hivites (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 14:6; 36:20-30; 1 Chr. 1:38, 39</reflink>). They were dispossessed by the descendants of Esau, and as a people gradually became extinct (<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 2:12-22</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Hormah">
    <description>banning; i.e., placing under a "ban," or devoting to utter destruction. After the manifestation of God's anger against the Israelites, on account of their rebellion and their murmurings when the spies returned to the camp at Kadesh, in the wilderness of Paran, with an evil report of the land, they quickly repented of their conduct, and presumed to go up "to the head of the mountain," seeking to enter the Promised Land, but without the presence of the Lord, without the ark of the convenant, and without Moses. The Amalekites and the Canaanites came down and "smote and discomfited them even unto Hormah" (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 14:45</reflink>). This place, or perhaps the watch-tower commanding it, was originally called Zephath (<reflink target="XXX">Judg. 1:17</reflink>), the modern Sebaiteh. Afterwards (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 21:1-3</reflink>) Arad, the king of the Canaanites, at the close of the wanderings, when the Israelites were a second time encamped at Kadesh, "fought against them, and took some of them prisoners." But Israel vowed a vow unto the Lord utterly to destroy the cities of the Canaanites; they "banned" them, and hence the place was now called Hormah. But this "ban" was not fully executed till the time of Joshua, who finally conquered the king of this district, so that the ancient name Zephath became "Hormah" (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 12:14; Judg. 1:17</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Horn">
    <description>Trumpets were at first horns perforated at the tip, used for various purposes (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 6:4,5</reflink>).</description>
    <description>Flasks or vessels were made of horn (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 16:1, 13; 1 Kings 1:39</reflink>).</description>
    <description>But the word is used also metaphorically to denote the projecting corners of the altar of burnt offerings (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 27:2</reflink>) and of incense (30:2). The horns of the altar of burnt offerings were to be smeared with the blood of the slain bullock (29:12; Lev. 4:7-18). The criminal, when his crime was accidental, found an asylum by laying hold of the horns of the altar (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 1:50; 2:28</reflink>).</description>
    <description>The word also denotes the peak or summit of a hill (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 5:1, where the word "hill" is the rendering of the same Hebrew word</reflink>).</description>
    <description>This word is used metaphorically also for strength (<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 33:17</reflink>) and honour (<reflink target="XXX">Job 16:15; Lam. 2:3</reflink>). Horns are emblems of power, dominion, glory, and fierceness, as they are the chief means of attack and defence with the animals endowed with them (<reflink target="XXX">Dan. 8:5, 9; 1 Sam. 2:1; 16:1, 13; 1 Kings 1:39; 22:11; Josh. 6:4, 5; Ps. 75:5, 10; 132:17; Luke 1:69, etc.</reflink>). The expression "horn of salvation," applied to Christ, means a salvation of strength, or a strong Saviour (<reflink target="XXX">Luke 1:69</reflink>). To have the horn "exalted" denotes prosperity and triumph (<reflink target="XXX">Ps. 89:17, 24</reflink>). To "lift up" the horn is to act proudly (<reflink target="XXX">Zech. 1:21</reflink>).</description>
    <description>Horns are also the symbol of royal dignity and power (<reflink target="XXX">Jer. 48:25; Zech. 1:18; Dan. 8:24</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Hornet">
    <description>Heb. tsir'ah, "stinging", (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 23:28; Deut. 7:20; Josh. 24:12</reflink>). The word is used in these passages as referring to some means by which the Canaanites were to be driven out from before the Israelites. Some have supposed that the word is used in a metaphorical sense as the symbol of some panic which would seize the people as a "terror of God" (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 35:5</reflink>), the consternation with which God would inspire the Canaanites. In Palestine there are four species of hornets, differing from our hornets, being larger in size, and they are very abundant. They "attack human beings in a very furious manner." "The furious attack of a swarm of hornets drives cattle and horses to madness, and has even caused the death of the animals."</description>

  </item>
  <item id="Horse">
    <description>always referred to in the Bible in connection with warlike operations, except Isa. 28:28. The war-horse is described Job 39:19-25. For a long period after their settlement in Canaan the Israelites made no use of horses, according to the prohibition, Deut. 17:16. David was the first to form a force of cavalry (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 8:4</reflink>). But Solomon, from his connection with Egypt, greatly multiplied their number (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 4:26; 10:26, 29</reflink>). After this, horses were freely used in Israel (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 22:4; 2 Kings 3:7; 9:21, 33; 11:16</reflink>). The furniture of the horse consisted simply of a bridle (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 30:28</reflink>) and a curb (<reflink target="XXX">Ps. 32:9</reflink>).</description>

  </item>
  <item id="Horse-leech">
    <description>occurs only in Prov. 30:15 (Heb. 'alukah); the generic name for any blood-sucking annelid. There are various species in the marshes and pools of Palestine. That here referred to, the Hoemopis, is remarkable for the coarseness of its bite, and is therefore not used for medical purposes. They are spoken of in the East with feelings of aversion and horror, because of their propensity to fasten on the tongue and nostrils of horses when they come to drink out of the pools. The medicinal leech (Hirudo medicinalis), besides other species of leeches, are common in the waters of Syria.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Horseman">
    <description>Heb. ba'al parash, "master of a horse." The "horsemen" mentioned Ex. 14:9 were "mounted men", i.e., men who rode in chariots. The army of Pharaoh consisted of a chariot and infantry force. We find that at a later period, however, the Egyptians had cavalry (<reflink target="XXX">2 Chr. 12:3</reflink>). (<see target="x-self">See HORSE.</see>)</description>

  </item>
  <item id="Hosea">
    <description>salvation, the son of Beeri, and author of the book of prophecies bearing his name. He belonged to the kingdom of Israel. "His Israelitish origin is attested by the peculiar, rough, Aramaizing diction, pointing to the northern part of Palestine; by the intimate acquaintance he evinces with the localities of Ephraim (5:1; 6:8, 9; 12:12; 14:6, etc.); by passages like 1:2, where the kingdom is styled 'the land', and 7:5, where the Israelitish king is designated as 'our' king." The period of his ministry (extending to some sixty years) is indicated in the superscription (<reflink target="XXX">Hos. 1:1, 2</reflink>). He is the only prophet of Israel who has left any written prophecy.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Hosea, Prophecies of">
    <description>This book stands first in order among the "Minor Prophets." "The probable cause of the location of Hosea may be the thoroughly national character of his oracles, their length, their earnest tone, and vivid representations." This was the longest of the prophetic books written before the Captivity. Hosea prophesied in a dark and melancholy period of Israel's history, the period of Israel's decline and fall. Their sins had brought upon them great national disasters. "Their homicides and fornication, their perjury and theft, their idolatry and impiety, are censured and satirized with a faithful severity." He was a contemporary of Isaiah. The book may be divided into two parts, the first containing chapters 1-3, and symbolically representing the idolatry of Israel under imagery borrowed from the matrimonial relation. The figures of marriage and adultery are common in the Old Testament writings to represent the spiritual relations between Jehovah and the people of Israel. Here we see the apostasy of Israel and their punishment, with their future repentance, forgiveness, and restoration.</description>
    <description>The second part, containing 4-14, is a summary of Hosea's discourses, filled with denunciations, threatenings, exhortations, promises, and revelations of mercy.</description>
    <description>Quotations from Hosea are found in Matt. 2:15; 9:15; 12:7; Rom. 9:25, 26. There are, in addition, various allusions to it in other places (<reflink target="XXX">Luke 23:30; Rev. 6:16, comp. Hos. 10:8; Rom. 9:25, 26; 1 Pet. 2:10, comp. Hos. 1:10, etc.</reflink>).</description>
    <description>As regards the style of this writer, it has been said that "each verse forms a whole for itself, like one heavy toll in a funeral knell." "Inversions (7:8; 9:11, 13; 12: 8), anacolutha (9:6; 12:8, etc.), ellipses (9:4; 13:9, etc.), paranomasias, and plays upon words, are very characteristic of Hosea (8:7; 9:15; 10:5; 11:5; 12:11)."</description>

    <description>(3.) The last king of Israel. He conspired against and slew his predecessor, Pekah (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 7:16</reflink>), but did not ascend the throne till after an interregnum of warfare of eight years (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 17:1, 2</reflink>). Soon after this he submitted to Shalmaneser, the Assyrian king, who a second time invaded the land to punish Hoshea, because of his withholding tribute which he had promised to pay. A second revolt brought back the Assyrian king Sargon, who besieged Samaria, and carried the ten tribes away beyond the Euphrates, B.C. 720 (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 17:5, 6; 18:9-12</reflink>). No more is heard of Hoshea. He disappeared like "foam upon the water" (<reflink target="XXX">Hos. 10:7; 13:11</reflink>).</description>

    <description>In warfare, a troop or military force. This consisted at first only of infantry. Solomon afterwards added cavalry (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 4:26; 10:26</reflink>). Every male Israelite from twenty to fifty years of age was bound by the law to bear arms when necessary (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 1:3; 26:2; 2 Chr. 25:5</reflink>).</description>
    <description>Saul was the first to form a standing army (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 13:2; 24:2</reflink>).

  <item id="Hour">
    <description>First found in Dan. 3:6; 4:19, 33;5:5. It is the rendering of the Chaldee shaah, meaning a "moment," a "look." It is used in the New Testament frequently to denote some determinate season (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 8:13; Luke 12:39</reflink>).</description>
    <description>With the ancient Hebrews the divisions of the day were "morning, evening, and noon-day" (<reflink target="XXX">Ps. 55:17, etc.</reflink>). The Greeks, following the Babylonians, divided the day into twelve hours. The Jews, during the Captivity, learned also from the Babylonians this method of dividing time. When Judea became subject to the Romans, the Jews adopted the Roman mode of reckoning time. The night was divided into four watches (<reflink target="XXX">Luke 12:38; Matt. 14:25; 13:25</reflink>). Frequent allusion is also made to hours (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 25:13; 26:40, etc.</reflink>). (<see target="x-self">See DAY.</see>)</description>
    <description>An hour was the twelfth part of the day, reckoning from sunrise to sunset, and consequently it perpetually varied in length.</description>

  <item id="House">
    <description>Till their sojourn in Egypt the Hebrews dwelt in tents. They then for the first time inhabited cities (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 47:3; Ex. 12:7; Heb. 11:9</reflink>). From the earliest times the Assyrians and the Canaanites were builders of cities. The Hebrews after the Conquest took possession of the captured cities, and seem to have followed the methods of building that had been pursued by the Canaanites. Reference is made to the stone (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 7:9; Isa. 9:10</reflink>) and marble (<reflink target="XXX">1 Chr. 29:2</reflink>) used in building, and to the internal wood-work of the houses (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 6:15; 7:2; 10:11, 12; 2 Chr. 3:5; Jer. 22:14</reflink>). "Ceiled houses" were such as had beams inlaid in the walls to which wainscotting was fastened (<reflink target="XXX">Ezra 6:4; Jer. 22:14; Hag. 1:4</reflink>). "Ivory houses" had the upper parts of the walls adorned with figures in stucco with gold and ivory (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 22:39; 2 Chr. 3:6; Ps. 45:8</reflink>).</description>
    <description>The roofs of the dwelling-houses were flat, and are often alluded to in Scripture (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 11:2; Isa. 22:1; Matt. 24:17</reflink>). Sometimes tents or booths were erected on them (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 16:22</reflink>). They were protected by parapets or low walls (<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 22:8</reflink>). On the house-tops grass sometimes grew (<reflink target="XXX">Prov. 19:13; 27:15; Ps. 129:6, 7</reflink>). They were used, not only as places of recreation in the evening, but also sometimes as sleeping-places at night (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 9:25, 26; 2 Sam. 11:2; 16:22; Dan. 4:29; Job 27:18; Prov. 21:9</reflink>), and as places of devotion (<reflink target="XXX">Jer. 32:29; 19:13</reflink>).</description>

She was consulted regarding the "book of the law" discovered by the high priest Hilkiah (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 22:14-20; 2 Chr. 34:22-28</reflink>). She resided in that part of Jerusalem called the Mishneh (A.V., "the college;" R.V., "the second quarter"), supposed by some to be the suburb between the inner and the outer wall, the second or lower city, Akra. Miriam (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 15:20</reflink>) and Deborah (<reflink target="XXX">Judg. 4:4</reflink>) are the only others who bear the title of "prophetess," for the word in Isa. 8:3 means only the prophet's wife.</description>

  <item id="Humiliation of Christ">

    <description>His humiliation was necessary (1) to execute the purpose of God (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 2:23, 24; Ps. 40:6-8</reflink>), (2) fulfil the Old Testament types and prophecies, (3) satisfy the law in the room of the guilty (Isa. 53; Heb. 9:12, 15), procure for them eternal redemption, (4) and to show us an example.</description>

It is a state of mind well pleasing to God (<reflink target="XXX">1 Pet. 3:4</reflink>); it preserves the soul in tranquillity (<reflink target="XXX">Ps. 69:32, 33</reflink>), and makes us patient under trials (<reflink target="XXX">Job 1:22</reflink>).</description>
    <description>Christ has set us an example of humility (<reflink target="XXX">Phil. 2:6-8</reflink>). We should be led thereto by a remembrance of our sins (<reflink target="XXX">Lam. 3:39</reflink>), and by the thought that it is the way to honour (<reflink target="XXX">Prov. 16:18</reflink>), and that the greatest promises are made to the humble (<reflink target="XXX">Ps. 147:6; Isa. 57:15; 66:2; 1 Pet. 5:5</reflink>). It is a "great paradox in Christianity that it makes humility the avenue to glory."</description>

  <item id="Hunting">
    <description>mentioned first in Gen. 10:9 in connection with Nimrod. Esau was "a cunning hunter" (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 25:27</reflink>). Hunting was practised by the Hebrews after their settlement in the "Land of Promise" (<reflink target="XXX">Lev. 17:15; Prov. 12:27</reflink>). The lion and other ravenous beasts were found in Palestine (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 17:34; 2 Sam. 23:20; 1 Kings 13:24; Ezek. 19:3-8</reflink>), and it must have been necessary to hunt and destroy them. Various snares and gins were used in hunting (<reflink target="XXX">Ps. 91:3; Amos 3:5; 2 Sam. 23:20</reflink>).</description>
    <description>War is referred to under the idea of hunting (<reflink target="XXX">Jer. 16:16; Ezek. 32:30</reflink>).</description>

He was associated with Aaron in charge of the people when Moses was absent on Sinai (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 24:14</reflink>). He was probably of the tribe of Judah, and grandfather of Bezaleel (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 31:2; 35:30; 1 Chr. 2:19</reflink>).</description>

  <item id="Husband">
    <description>i.e., the "house-band," connecting and keeping together the whole family. A man when betrothed was esteemed from that time a husband (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 1:16, 20; Luke 2:5</reflink>). A recently married man was exempt from going to war for "one year" (<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 20:7; 24:5</reflink>).</description>

  <item id="Hushai">
    <description>quick, "the Archite," "the king's friend" (<reflink target="XXX">1 Chr. 27:33</reflink>). When David fled from Jerusalem, on account of the rebellion of Absalom, and had reached the summit of Olivet, he there met Hushai, whom he sent back to Jerusalem for the purpose of counteracting the influence of Ahithophel, who had joined the ranks of Absalom (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 15:32, 37; 16:16-18</reflink>). It was by his advice that Absalom refrained from immediately pursuing after David. By this delay the cause of Absalom was ruined, for it gave David time to muster his forces.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Husk">
    <description>In Num. 6:4 (Heb. zag) it means the "skin" of a grape. In 2 Kings 4:42 (Heb. tsiqlon) it means a "sack" for grain, as rendered in the Revised Version. In Luke 15:16, in the parable of the Prodigal Son, it designates the beans of the carob tree, or Ceratonia siliqua. From the supposition, mistaken, however, that it was on the husks of this tree that John the Baptist fed, it is called "St. John's bread" and "locust tree." This tree is in "February covered with innumerable purple-red pendent blossoms, which ripen in April and May into large crops of pods from 6 to 10 inches long, flat, brown, narrow, and bent like a horn (whence the Greek name keratia, meaning 'little horns'), with a sweetish taste when still unripe. Enormous quantities of these are gathered for sale in various towns and for exportation." "They were eaten as food, though only by the poorest of the poor, in the time of our Lord." The bean is called a "gerah," which is used as the name of the smallest Hebrew weight, twenty of these making a shekel.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Hymn">
    <description>occurs only Eph. 5:19 and Col. 3:16. The verb to "sing an hymn" occurs Matt. 26:30 and Mark 14:26. The same Greek word is rendered to "sing praises" Acts 16:25 (R.V., "sing hymns") and Heb. 2:12. The "hymn" which our Lord sang with his disciples at the last Supper is generally supposed to have been the latter part of the Hallel, comprehending Ps. 113-118. It was thus a name given to a number of psalms taken together and forming a devotional exercise.</description>
    <description>The noun hymn is used only with reference to the services of the Greeks, and was distinguished from the psalm. The Greek tunes required Greek hymns. Our information regarding the hymnology of the early Christians is very limited.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Hypocrite">
    <description>one who puts on a mask and feigns himself to be what he is not; a dissembler in religion. Our Lord severely rebuked the scribes and Pharisees for their hypocrisy (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 6:2, 5, 16</reflink>). "The hypocrite's hope shall perish" (<reflink target="XXX">Job 8:13</reflink>). The Hebrew word here rendered "hypocrite" rather means the "godless" or "profane," as it is rendered in Jer. 23:11, i.e., polluted with crimes.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Hyssop">
    <description>(Heb. 'ezob; LXX. hyssopos), first mentioned in Ex. 12:22 in connection with the institution of the Passover. We find it afterwards mentioned in Lev. 14:4, 6, 52; Num. 19:6, 18; Heb. 9:19. It is spoken of as a plant "springing out of the wall" (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 4:33</reflink>). Many conjectures have been formed as to what this plant really was. Some contend that it was a species of marjoram (origanum), six species of which are found in Palestine. Others with more probability think that it was the caper plant, the Capparis spinosa of Linnaeus. This plant grew in Egypt, in the desert of Sinai, and in Palestine. It was capable of producing a stem three or four feet in length (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 27:48; Mark 15:36. Comp. John 19:29</reflink>).</description>

It is also called Bileam (<reflink target="XXX">1 Chr. 6:70</reflink>). It was probably the modern Jelamah, a village 2 1/2 miles north of Jenin.</description>

  <item id="Ichabod">
    <description>When the tidings of the disastrous defeat of the Israelites in the battle against the Philistines near to Mizpeh were carried to Shiloh, the wife of Phinehas "was near to be delivered. And when she heard the tidings that the ark of God was taken, and that her father-in-law and her husband were dead, she bowed herself and travailed" (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 4:19-22</reflink>). In her great distress she regarded not "the women that stood by her," but named the child that was born "Ichabod" i.e., no glory, saying, "The glory is departed from Isreal;" and with that word on her lips she expired.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Iconium">
    <description>the capital of ancient Lycaonia. It was first visited by Paul and Barnabas from Antioch-in-Pisidia during the apostle's first missionary journey (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 13:50, 51</reflink>). Here they were persecuted by the Jews, and being driven from the city, they fled to Lystra. They afterwards returned to Iconium, and encouraged the church which had been founded there (14:21,22). It was probably again visited by Paul during his third missionary journey along with Silas (18:23). It is the modern Konieh, at the foot of Mount Taurus, about 120 miles inland from the Mediterranean.</description>

  <item id="Idolatry">
    <description>image-worship or divine honour paid to any created object. Paul describes the origin of idolatry in Rom. 1:21-25: men forsook God, and sank into ignorance and moral corruption (1:28).</description>
    <description>The forms of idolatry are, (1.) Fetishism, or the worship of trees, rivers, hills, stones, etc.</description>
    <description>(2.) Nature worship, the worship of the sun, moon, and stars, as the supposed powers of nature.</description>
    <description>(3.) Hero worship, the worship of deceased ancestors, or of heroes.</description>
    <description>In Scripture, idolatry is regarded as of heathen origin, and as being imported among the Hebrews through contact with heathen nations. The first allusion to idolatry is in the account of Rachel stealing her father's teraphim (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 31:19</reflink>), which were the relics of the worship of other gods by Laban's progenitors "on the other side of the river in old time" (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 24:2</reflink>). During their long residence in Egypt the Hebrews fell into idolatry, and it was long before they were delivered from it (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 24:14; Ezek. 20:7</reflink>). Many a token of God's displeasure fell upon them because of this sin.</description>
    <description>The idolatry learned in Egypt was probably rooted out from among the people during the forty years' wanderings; but when the Jews entered Palestine, they came into contact with the monuments and associations of the idolatry of the old Canaanitish races, and showed a constant tendency to depart from the living God and follow the idolatrous practices of those heathen nations. It was their great national sin, which was only effectually rebuked by the Babylonian exile. That exile finally purified the Jews of all idolatrous tendencies.</description>
    <description>The first and second commandments are directed against idolatry of every form. Individuals and communities were equally amenable to the rigorous code. The individual offender was devoted to destruction (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 22:20</reflink>). His nearest relatives were not only bound to denounce him and deliver him up to punishment (<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 13:20-10</reflink>), but their hands were to strike the first blow when, on the evidence of two witnesses at least, he was stoned (<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 17:2-7</reflink>). To attempt to seduce others to false worship was a crime of equal enormity (13:6-10). An idolatrous nation shared the same fate. No facts are more strongly declared in the Old Testament than that the extermination of the Canaanites was the punishment of their idolatry (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 34:15, 16; Deut. 7; 12:29-31; 20:17</reflink>), and that the calamities of the Israelites were due to the same cause (<reflink target="XXX">Jer. 2:17</reflink>). "A city guilty of idolatry was looked upon as a cancer in the state; it was considered to be in rebellion, and treated according to the laws of war. Its inhabitants and all their cattle were put to death." Jehovah was the theocratic King of Israel, the civil Head of the commonwealth, and therefore to an Israelite idolatry was a state offence (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 15:23</reflink>), high treason. On taking possession of the land, the Jews were commanded to destroy all traces of every kind of the existing idolatry of the Canaanites (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 23:24, 32; 34:13; Deut. 7:5, 25; 12:1-3</reflink>).</description>
    <description>In the New Testament the term idolatry is used to designate covetousness (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 6:24; Luke 16:13; Col. 3:5; Eph. 5:5</reflink>).</description>

  <item id="Immortality">
    <description>perpetuity of existence. The doctrine of immortality is taught in the Old Testament. It is plainly implied in the writings of Moses (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 5:22, 24; 25:8; 37:35; 47:9; 49:29, comp. Heb. 11:13-16; Ex. 3:6, comp. Matt. 22:23</reflink>). It is more clearly and fully taught in the later books (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 14:9; Ps. 17:15; 49:15; 73:24</reflink>). It was thus a doctrine obviously well known to the Jews.</description>
    <description>With the full revelation of the gospel this doctrine was "brought to light" (<reflink target="XXX">2 Tim. 1:10; 1 Cor. 15; 2 Cor. 5:1-6; 1 Thess. 4:13-18</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Imputation">
    <description>is used to designate any action or word or thing as reckoned to a person. Thus in doctrinal language (1) the sin of Adam is imputed to all his descendants, i.e., it is reckoned as theirs, and they are dealt with therefore as guilty; (2) the righteousness of Christ is imputed to them that believe in him, or so attributed to them as to be considered their own; and (3) our sins are imputed to Christ, i.e., he assumed our "law-place," undertook to answer the demands of justice for our sins. In all these cases the nature of imputation is the same (<reflink target="XXX">Rom. 5:12-19; comp. Philemon 1:18, 19</reflink>).</description>

  <item id="Incarnation">
    <description>that act of grace whereby Christ took our human nature into union with his Divine Person, became man. Christ is both God and man. Human attributes and actions are predicated of him, and he of whom they are predicated is God. A Divine Person was united to a human nature (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 20:28; Rom. 8:32; 1 Cor. 2:8; Heb. 2:11-14; 1 Tim. 3:16; Gal. 4:4, etc.</reflink>).

    <description>a fragrant composition prepared by the "art of the apothecary." It consisted of four ingredients "beaten small" (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 30:34-36</reflink>). That which was not thus prepared was called "strange incense" (30:9). It was offered along with every meat-offering; and besides was daily offered on the golden altar in the holy place, and on the great day of atonement was burnt by the high priest in the holy of holies (30:7, 8). It was the symbol of prayer (<reflink target="XXX">Ps. 141:1,2; Rev. 5:8; 8:3, 4</reflink>).</description>

  <item id="India">

The country so designated here is not the peninsula of Hindustan, but the country surrounding the Indus, the Punjab. The people and the products of India were well known to the Jews, who seem to have carried on an active trade with that country (<reflink target="XXX">Ezek. 27:15, 24</reflink>).</description>

  <item id="Inkhorn">
    <description>The Hebrew word so rendered means simply a round vessel or cup for containing ink, which was generally worn by writers in the girdle (<reflink target="XXX">Ezek. 9:2, 3,11</reflink>). The word "inkhorn" was used by the translators, because in former times in this country horns were used for containing ink.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Inn">
    <description>in the modern sense, unknown in the East. The khans or caravanserais, which correspond to the European inn, are not alluded to in the Old Testament. The "inn" mentioned in Ex. 4:24 was just the halting-place of the caravan. In later times khans were erected for the accommodation of travellers. In Luke 2:7 the word there so rendered denotes a place for loosing the beasts of their burdens. It is rendered "guest-chamber" in Mark 14:14 and Luke 22:11. In Luke 10:34 the word so rendered is different. That inn had an "inn-keeper," who attended to the wants of travellers.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Inspiration">
    <description>that extraordinary or supernatural divine influence vouchsafed to those who wrote the Holy Scriptures, rendering their writings infallible. "All scripture is given by inspiration of God" (R.V., "Every scripture inspired of God"), 2 Tim. 3:16. This is true of all the "sacred writings," not in the sense of their being works of genius or of supernatural insight, but as "theopneustic," i.e., "breathed into by God" in such a sense that the writers were supernaturally guided to express exactly what God intended them to express as a revelation of his mind and will. The testimony of the sacred writers themselves abundantly demonstrates this truth; and if they are infallible as teachers of doctrine, then the doctrine of plenary inspiration must be accepted. There are no errors in the Bible as it came from God, none have been proved to exist. Difficulties and phenomena we cannot explain are not errors. All these books of the Old and New Testaments are inspired. We do not say that they contain, but that they are, the Word of God. The gift of inspiration rendered the writers the organs of God, for the infallible communication of his mind and will, in the very manner and words in which it was originally given.</description>
    <description>As to the nature of inspiration we have no information. This only we know, it rendered the writers infallible. They were all equally inspired, and are all equally infallible. The inspiration of the sacred writers did not change their characters. They retained all their individual peculiarities as thinkers or writers. (See BIBLE; WORD OF GOD</description>

  <item id="Intercession of Christ">
    <description>Christ's priestly office consists of these two parts, (1) the offering up of himself as a sacrifice, and (2) making continual intercession for us.</description>
    <description>When on earth he made intercession for his people (<reflink target="XXX">Luke 23:34; John 17:20; Heb. 5:7</reflink>); but now he exercises this function of his priesthood in heaven, where he is said to appear in the presence of God for us (<reflink target="XXX">Heb. 9:12,24</reflink>).</description>
    <description>His advocacy with the Father for his people rests on the basis of his own all-perfect sacrifice. Thus he pleads for and obtains the fulfilment of all the promises of the everlasting covenant (<reflink target="XXX">1 John 2:1; John 17:24; Heb. 7:25</reflink>). He can be "touched with the feeling of our infirmities," and is both a merciful and a faithful high priest (<reflink target="XXX">Heb. 2:17, 18; 4:15, 16</reflink>). This intercession is an essential part of his mediatorial work. Through him we have "access" to the Father (<reflink target="XXX">John 14:6; Eph. 2:18; 3:12</reflink>). "The communion of his people with the Father will ever be sustained through him as mediatorial Priest" (<reflink target="XXX">Ps. 110:4; Rev. 7:17</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Intercession of the Spirit">
    <description>(<reflink target="XXX">Rom. 8:26, 27; John 14:26</reflink>). "Christ is a royal Priest (<reflink target="XXX">Zech. 6:13</reflink>). From the same throne, as King, he dispenses his Spirit to all the objects of his care, while as Priest he intercedes for them. The Spirit acts for him, taking only of his things. They both act with one consent, Christ as principal, the Spirit as his agent. Christ intercedes for us, without us, as our advocate in heaven, according to the provisions of the everlasting covenant. The Holy Spirit works upon our minds and hearts, enlightening and quickening, and thus determining our desires 'according to the will of God,' as our advocate within us. The work of the one is complementary to that of the other, and together they form a complete whole.", Hodge's Outlines of Theology.</description>

  <item id="Isaac">
    <description>laughter. (1) Israel, or the kingdom of the ten tribes (<reflink target="XXX">Amos 7:9, 16</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(2.) The only son of Abraham by Sarah. He was the longest lived of the three patriarchs (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 21:1-3</reflink>). He was circumcised when eight days old (4-7); and when he was probably two years old a great feast was held in connection with his being weaned.</description>
    <description>The next memorable event in his life is that connected with the command of God given to Abraham to offer him up as a sacrifice on a mountain in the land of Moriah (Gen. 22). (<see target="x-self">See ABRAHAM.</see>) When he was forty years of age Rebekah was chosen for his wife (Gen. 24). After the death and burial of his father he took up his residence at Beer-lahai-roi (25:7-11), where his two sons, Esau and Jacob, were born (21-26), the former of whom seems to have been his favourite son (27,28).</description>
    <description>In consequence of a famine (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 26:1</reflink>) Isaac went to Gerar, where he practised deception as to his relation to Rebekah, imitating the conduct of his father in Egypt (12:12-20) and in Gerar (20:2). The Philistine king rebuked him for his prevarication.</description>
    <description>After sojourning for some time in the land of the Philistines, he returned to Beersheba, where God gave him fresh assurance of covenant blessing, and where Abimelech entered into a covenant of peace with him.</description>
    <description>The next chief event in his life was the blessing of his sons (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 27:1</reflink>). He died at Mamre, "being old and full of days" (35:27-29), one hundred and eighty years old, and was buried in the cave of Machpelah.</description>
    <description>In the New Testament reference is made to his having been "offered up" by his father (<reflink target="XXX">Heb. 11:17; James 2:21</reflink>), and to his blessing his sons (<reflink target="XXX">Heb. 11:20</reflink>). As the child of promise, he is contrasted with Ishmael (<reflink target="XXX">Rom. 9:7, 10; Gal. 4:28; Heb. 11:18</reflink>).</description>
    <description>Isaac is "at once a counterpart of his father in simple devoutness and purity of life, and a contrast in his passive weakness of character, which in part, at least, may have sprung from his relations to his mother and wife. After the expulsion of Ishmael and Hagar, Isaac had no competitor, and grew up in the shade of Sarah's tent, moulded into feminine softness by habitual submission to her strong, loving will." His life was so quiet and uneventful that it was spent "within the circle of a few miles; so guileless that he let Jacob overreach him rather than disbelieve his assurance; so tender that his mother's death was the poignant sorrow of years; so patient and gentle that peace with his neighbours was dearer than even such a coveted possession as a well of living water dug by his own men; so grandly obedient that he put his life at his father's disposal; so firm in his reliance on God that his greatest concern through life was to honour the divine promise given to his race.", Geikie's Hours, etc.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Isaiah">
    <description>(Heb. Yesh'yahu, i.e., "the salvation of Jehovah"). (1.) The son of Amoz (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 1:1; 2:1</reflink>), who was apparently a man of humble rank. His wife was called "the prophetess" (8:3), either because she was endowed with the prophetic gift, like Deborah (<reflink target="XXX">Judg. 4:4</reflink>) and Huldah (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 22:14-20</reflink>), or simply because she was the wife of "the prophet" (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 38:1</reflink>). He had two sons, who bore symbolical names.</description>
    <description>He exercised the functions of his office during the reigns of Uzziah (or Azariah), Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah (1:1). Uzziah reigned fifty-two years (B.C. 810-759), and Isaiah must have begun his career a few years before Uzziah's death, probably B.C. 762. He lived till the fourteenth year of Hezekiah, and in all likelihood outlived that monarch (who died B.C. 698), and may have been contemporary for some years with Manasseh. Thus Isaiah may have prophesied for the long period of at least sixty-four years.</description>
    <description>His first call to the prophetical office is not recorded. A second call came to him "in the year that King Uzziah died" (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 6:1</reflink>). He exercised his ministry in a spirit of uncompromising firmness and boldness in regard to all that bore on the interests of religion. He conceals nothing and keeps nothing back from fear of man. He was also noted for his spirituality and for his deep-toned reverence toward "the holy One of Israel."</description>
    <description>In early youth Isaiah must have been moved by the invasion of Israel by the Assyrian monarch Pul (q.v.), 2 Kings 15:19; and again, twenty years later, when he had already entered on his office, by the invasion of Tiglath-pileser and his career of conquest. Ahaz, king of Judah, at this crisis refused to co-operate with the kings of Israel and Syria in opposition to the Assyrians, and was on that account attacked and defeated by Rezin of Damascus and Pekah of Samaria (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 16:5; 2 Chr. 28:5, 6</reflink>). Ahaz, thus humbled, sided with Assyria, and sought the aid of Tiglath-pileser against Israel and Syria. The consequence was that Rezin and Pekah were conquered and many of the people carried captive to Assyria (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 15:29; 16:9; 1 Chr. 5:26</reflink>). Soon after this Shalmaneser determined wholly to subdue the kingdom of Israel. Samaria was taken and destroyed (B.C. 722). So long as Ahaz reigned, the kingdom of Judah was unmolested by the Assyrian power; but on his accession to the throne, Hezekiah (B.C. 726), who "rebelled against the king of Assyria" (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 18:7</reflink>), in which he was encouraged by Isaiah, who exhorted the people to place all their dependence on Jehovah (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 10:24; 37:6</reflink>), entered into an alliance with the king of Egypt (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 30:2-4</reflink>). This led the king of Assyria to threaten the king of Judah, and at length to invade the land. Sennacherib (B.C. 701) led a powerful army into Palestine. Hezekiah was reduced to despair, and submitted to the Assyrians (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 18:14-16</reflink>). But after a brief interval war broke out again, and again Sennacherib (q.v.) led an army into Palestine, one detachment of which threatened Jerusalem (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 36:2-22; 37:8</reflink>). Isaiah on that occasion encouraged Hezekiah to resist the Assyrians (37:1-7), whereupon Sennacherib sent a threatening letter to Hezekiah, which he "spread before the Lord" (37:14). The judgement of God now fell on the Assyrian host. "Like Xerxes in Greece, Sennacherib never recovered from the shock of the disaster in Judah. He made no more expeditions against either Southern Palestine or Egypt." The remaining years of Hezekiah's reign were peaceful (<reflink target="XXX">2 Chr. 32:23, 27-29</reflink>). Isaiah probably lived to its close, and possibly into the reign of Manasseh, but the time and manner of his death are unknown. There is a tradition that he suffered martyrdom in the heathen reaction in the time of Manasseh (q.v.).</description>

  <item id="Isaiah, The Book of">
    <description>consists of prophecies delivered (Isa. 1) in the reign of Uzziah (1-5), (2) of Jotham (6), (3) Ahaz (7-14:28), (4) the first half of Hezekiah's reign (14:28-35), (5) the second half of Hezekiah's reign (36-66). Thus, counting from the fourth year before Uzziah's death (B.C. 762) to the last year of Hezekiah (B.C. 698), Isaiah's ministry extended over a period of sixty-four years. He may, however, have survived Hezekiah, and may have perished in the way indicated above.</description>
    <description>The book, as a whole, has been divided into three main parts: (1.) The first thirty-five chapters, almost wholly prophetic, Israel's enemy Assyria, present the Messiah as a mighty Ruler and King. (2.) Four chapters are historical (36-39), relating to the times of Hezekiah. (3.) Prophetical (40-66), Israel's enemy Babylon, describing the Messiah as a suffering victim, meek and lowly.</description>
    <description>The genuineness of the section Isa. 40-66 has been keenly opposed by able critics. They assert that it must be the production of a deutero-Isaiah, who lived toward the close of the Babylonian captivity. This theory was originated by Koppe, a German writer at the close of the last century. There are other portions of the book also (e.g., ch. 13; 24-27; and certain verses in ch. 14 and 21) which they attribute to some other prophet than Isaiah. Thus they say that some five or seven, or even more, unknown prophets had a hand in the production of this book. The considerations which have led to such a result are various: (1.) They cannot, as some say, conceive it possible that Isaiah, living in B.C. 700, could foretell the appearance and the exploits of a prince called Cyrus, who would set the Jews free from captivity one hundred and seventy years after. (2.) It is alleged that the prophet takes the time of the Captivity as his standpoint, and speaks of it as then present; and (3) that there is such a difference between the style and language of the closing section (40-66) and those of the preceding chapters as to necessitate a different authorship, and lead to the conclusion that there were at least two Isaiahs. But even granting the fact of a great diversity of style and language, this will not necessitate the conclusion attempted to be drawn from it. The diversity of subjects treated of and the peculiarities of the prophet's position at the time the prophecies were uttered will sufficiently account for this.</description>
    <description>The arguments in favour of the unity of the book are quite conclusive. When the LXX. version was made (about B.C. 250) the entire contents of the book were ascribed to Isaiah, the son of Amoz. It is not called in question, moreover, that in the time of our Lord the book existed in the form in which we now have it. Many prophecies in the disputed portions are quoted in the New Testament as the words of Isaiah (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 3:3; Luke 3:4-6; 4:16-41; John 12:38; Acts 8:28; Rom. 10:16-21</reflink>). Universal and persistent tradition has ascribed the whole book to one author.</description>
    <description>Besides this, the internal evidence, the similarity in the language and style, in the thoughts and images and rhetorical ornaments, all points to the same conclusion; and its local colouring and allusions show that it is obviously of Palestinian origin. The theory therefore of a double authorship of the book, much less of a manifold authorship, cannot be maintained. The book, with all the diversity of its contents, is one, and is, we believe, the production of the great prophet whose name it bears.</description>

He was born at Mamre, when Abraham was eighty-six years of age, eleven years after his arrival in Canaan (16:3; 21:5). At the age of thirteen he was circumcised (17:25). He grew up a true child of the desert, wild and wayward. On the occasion of the weaning of Isaac his rude and wayward spirit broke out in expressions of insult and mockery (21:9, 10); and Sarah, discovering this, said to Abraham, "Expel this slave and her son." Influenced by a divine admonition, Abraham dismissed Hagar and her son with no more than a skin of water and some bread. The narrative describing this act is one of the most beautiful and touching incidents of patriarchal life (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 21:14-16</reflink>).

    <description>Ishmael settled in the land of Paran, a region lying between Canaan and the mountains of Sinai; and "God was with him, and he became a great archer" (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 21:9-21</reflink>). He became a great desert chief, but of his history little is recorded. He was about ninety years of age when his father Abraham died, in connection with whose burial he once more for a moment reappears. On this occasion the two brothers met after being long separated. "Isaac with his hundreds of household slaves, Ishmael with his troops of wild retainers and half-savage allies, in all the state of a Bedouin prince, gathered before the cave of Machpelah, in the midst of the men of Heth, to pay the last duties to the 'father of the faithful,' would make a notable subject for an artist" (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 25:9</reflink>). Of the after events of his life but little is known. He died at the age of one hundred and thirty-seven years, but where and when are unknown (25:17). He had twelve sons, who became the founders of so many Arab tribes or colonies, the Ishmaelites, who spread over the wide desert spaces of Northern Arabia from the Red Sea to the Euphrates (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 37:25, 27, 28; 39:1</reflink>), "their hand against every man, and every man's hand against them."</description>

    <description>(B.C. 975-B.C. 722). Soon after the death of Solomon, Ahijah's prophecy (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 11:31-35</reflink>) was fulfilled, and the kingdom was rent in twain. Rehoboam, the son and successor of Solomon, was scarcely seated on his throne when the old jealousies between Judah and the other tribes broke out anew, and Jeroboam was sent for from Egypt by the malcontents (12:2,3). Rehoboam insolently refused to lighten the burdensome taxation and services which his father had imposed on his subjects (12:4), and the rebellion became complete. Ephraim and all Israel raised the old cry, "Every man to his tents, O Israel" (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 20:1</reflink>). Rehoboam fled to Jerusalem (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 12:1-18; 2 Chr. 10</reflink>), and Jeroboam was proclaimed king over all Israel at Shechem, Judah and Benjamin remaining faithful to Solomon's son. War, with varying success, was carried on between the two kingdoms for about sixty years, till Jehoshaphat entered into an alliance with the house of Ahab.</description>
    <description>Extent of the kingdom. In the time of Solomon the area of Palestine, excluding the Phoenician territories on the shore of the Mediterranean, did not much exceed 13,000 square miles. The kingdom of Israel comprehended about 9,375 square miles. Shechem was the first capital of this kingdom (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 12:25</reflink>), afterwards Tirza (14:17). Samaria was subsequently chosen as the capital (16:24), and continued to be so till the destruction of the kingdom by the Assyrians (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 17:5</reflink>). During the siege of Samaria (which lasted for three years) by the Assyrians, Shalmaneser died and was succeeded by Sargon, who himself thus records the capture of that city: "Samaria I looked at, I captured; 27,280 men who dwelt in it I carried away" (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 17:6</reflink>) into Assyria. Thus after a duration of two hundred and fifty-three years the kingdom of the ten tribes came to an end. They were scattered throughout the East. (See CAPTIVITY</description>
    <description>"Judah held its ground against Assyria for yet one hundred and twenty-three years, and became the rallying-point of the dispersed of every tribe, and eventually gave its name to the whole race. Those of the people who in the last struggle escaped into the territories of Judah or other neighbouring countries naturally looked to Judah as the head and home of their race. And when Judah itself was carried off to Babylon, many of the exiled Israelites joined them from Assyria, and swelled that immense population which made Babylonia a second Palestine."</description>
    <description>After the deportation of the ten tribes, the deserted land was colonized by various eastern tribes, whom the king of Assyria sent thither (<reflink target="XXX">Ezra 4:2, 10; 2 Kings 17:24-29</reflink>). (See KINGS</description>
    <description>In contrast with the kingdom of Judah is that of Israel. (1.) "There was no fixed capital and no religious centre. (2.) The army was often insubordinate. (3.) The succession was constantly interrupted, so that out of nineteen kings there were no less than nine dynasties, each ushered in by a revolution. (4.) The authorized priests left the kingdom in a body, and the priesthood established by Jeroboam had no divine sanction and no promise; it was corrupt at its very source." (Maclean's O. T.

After the battles at Gibeah, that tribe was almost extinguished, only six hundred men remaining. An expedition went against Jabesh-Gilead, the whole of whose inhabitants were put to the sword, except four hundred maidens, whom they brought as prisoners and sent to "proclaim peace" to the Benjamites who had fled to the crag Rimmon. These captives were given to them as wives, that the tribe might be saved from extinction (Judg. 21).</description>

  <item id="Jacob">
    <description>one who follows on another's heels; supplanter, (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 25:26; 27:36; Hos. 12:2-4</reflink>), the second born of the twin sons of Isaac by Rebekah. He was born probably at Lahai-roi, when his father was fifty-nine and Abraham one hundred and fifty-nine years old. Like his father, he was of a quiet and gentle disposition, and when he grew up followed the life of a shepherd, while his brother Esau became an enterprising hunter. His dealing with Esau, however, showed much mean selfishness and cunning (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 25:29-34</reflink>).</description>
    <description>When Isaac was about 160 years of age, Jacob and his mother conspired to deceive the aged patriarch (Gen. 27), with the view of procuring the transfer of the birthright to himself. The birthright secured to him who possessed it (1) superior rank in his family (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 49:3</reflink>); (2) a double portion of the paternal inheritance (<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 21:17</reflink>); (3) the priestly office in the family (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 8:17-19</reflink>); and (4) the promise of the Seed in which all nations of the earth were to be blessed (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 22:18</reflink>).</description>
    <description>Soon after his acquisition of his father's blessing (Gen. 27), Jacob became conscious of his guilt; and afraid of the anger of Esau, at the suggestion of Rebekah Isaac sent him away to Haran, 400 miles or more, to find a wife among his cousins, the family of Laban, the Syrian (28). There he met with Rachel (29). Laban would not consent to give him his daughter in marriage till he had served seven years; but to Jacob these years "seemed but a few days, for the love he had to her." But when the seven years were expired, Laban craftily deceived Jacob, and gave him his daughter Leah. Other seven years of service had to be completed probably before he obtained the beloved Rachel. But "life-long sorrow, disgrace, and trials, in the retributive providence of God, followed as a consequence of this double union."</description>
    <description>At the close of the fourteen years of service, Jacob desired to return to his parents, but at the entreaty of Laban he tarried yet six years with him, tending his flocks (31:41). He then set out with his family and property "to go to Isaac his father in the land of Canaan" (Gen. 31). Laban was angry when he heard that Jacob had set out on his journey, and pursued after him, overtaking him in seven days. The meeting was of a painful kind. After much recrimination and reproach directed against Jacob, Laban is at length pacified, and taking an affectionate farewell of his daughters, returns to his home in Padanaram. And now all connection of the Israelites with Mesopotamia is at an end.</description>
    <description>Soon after parting with Laban he is met by a company of angels, as if to greet him on his return and welcome him back to the Land of Promise (32:1, 2). He called the name of the place Mahanaim, i.e., "the double camp," probably his own camp and that of the angels. The vision of angels was the counterpart of that he had formerly seen at Bethel, when, twenty years before, the weary, solitary traveller, on his way to Padan-aram, saw the angels of God ascending and descending on the ladder whose top reached to heaven (28:12).</description>
    <description>He now hears with dismay of the approach of his brother Esau with a band of 400 men to meet him. In great agony of mind he prepares for the worst. He feels that he must now depend only on God, and he betakes himself to him in earnest prayer, and sends on before him a munificent present to Esau, "a present to my lord Esau from thy servant Jacob." Jacob's family were then transported across the Jabbok; but he himself remained behind, spending the night in communion with God. While thus engaged, there appeared one in the form of a man who wrestled with him. In this mysterious contest Jacob prevailed, and as a memorial of it his name was changed to Israel (wrestler with God); and the place where this occured he called Peniel, "for", said he, "I have seen God face to face, and my life is preserved" (32:25-31).</description>
    <description>After this anxious night, Jacob went on his way, halting, mysteriously weakened by the conflict, but strong in the assurance of the divine favour. Esau came forth and met him; but his spirit of revenge was appeased, and the brothers met as friends, and during the remainder of their lives they maintained friendly relations. After a brief sojourn at Succoth, Jacob moved forward and pitched his tent near Shechem (q.v.), 33:18; but at length, under divine directions, he moved to Bethel, where he made an altar unto God (35:6,7), and where God appeared to him and renewed the Abrahamic covenant. While journeying from Bethel to Ephrath (the Canaanitish name of Bethlehem), Rachel died in giving birth to her second son Benjamin (35:16-20), fifteen or sixteen years after the birth of Joseph. He then reached the old family residence at Mamre, to wait on the dying bed of his father Isaac. The complete reconciliation between Esau and Jacob was shown by their uniting in the burial of the patriarch (35:27-29).</description>
    <description>Jacob was soon after this deeply grieved by the loss of his beloved son Joseph through the jealousy of his brothers (37:33). Then follows the story of the famine, and the successive goings down into Egypt to buy corn (42), which led to the discovery of the long-lost Joseph, and the patriarch's going down with all his household, numbering about seventy souls (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 1:5; Deut. 10:22; Acts 7:14</reflink>), to sojourn in the land of Goshen. Here Jacob, "after being strangely tossed about on a very rough ocean, found at last a tranquil harbour, where all the best affections of his nature were gently exercised and largely unfolded" (Gen. 48). At length the end of his checkered course draws nigh, and he summons his sons to his bedside that he may bless them. Among his last words he repeats the story of Rachel's death, although forty years had passed away since that event took place, as tenderly as if it had happened only yesterday; and when "he had made an end of charging his sons, he gathered up his feet into the bed, and yielded up the ghost" (49:33). His body was embalmed and carried with great pomp into the land of Canaan, and buried beside his wife Leah in the cave of Machpelah, according to his dying charge. There, probably, his embalmed body remains to this day (50:1-13). (<see target="x-self">See HEBRON.</see>)</description>
    <description>The history of Jacob is referred to by the prophets Hosea (12:3, 4, 12) and Malachi (1:2). In Micah 1:5 the name is a poetic synonym for Israel, the kingdom of the ten tribes. There are, besides the mention of his name along with those of the other patriarchs, distinct references to events of his life in Paul's epistles (<reflink target="XXX">Rom. 9:11-13; Heb. 12:16; 11:21</reflink>). See references to his vision at Bethel and his possession of land at Shechem in John 1:51; 4:5, 12; also to the famine which was the occasion of his going down into Egypt in Acts 7:12 (<see target="x-self">See LUZ ; BETHEL.</see>)</description>

  <item id="Jacob's Well">
    <description>(<reflink target="XXX">John 4:5, 6</reflink>). This is one of the few sites in Palestine about which there is no dispute. It was dug by Jacob, and hence its name, in the "parcel of ground" which he purchased from the sons of Hamor (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 33:19</reflink>). It still exists, but although after copious rains it contains a little water, it is now usually quite dry. It is at the entrance to the valley between Ebal and Gerizim, about 2 miles south-east of Shechem. It is about 9 feet in diameter and about 75 feet in depth, though in ancient times it was no doubt much deeper, probably twice as deep. The digging of such a well must have been a very laborious and costly undertaking.</description>
    <description>"Unfortunately, the well of Jacob has not escaped that misplaced religious veneration which cannot be satisfied with leaving the object of it as it is, but must build over it a shrine to protect and make it sacred. A series of buildings of various styles, and of different ages, have cumbered the ground, choked up the well, and disfigured the natural beauty and simplicity of the spot. At present the rubbish in the well has been cleared out; but there is still a domed structure over it, and you gaze down the shaft cut in the living rock and see at a depth of 70 feet the surface of the water glimmering with a pale blue light in the darkness, while you notice how the limestone blocks that form its curb have been worn smooth, or else furrowed by the ropes of centuries" (Hugh Macmillan).</description>
    <description>At the entrance of the enclosure round the well is planted in the ground one of the wooden poles that hold the telegraph wires between Jerusalem and Haifa.</description>

She then took in her left hand one of the great wooden pins ("nail") which fastened down the cords of the tent, and in her right hand the mallet, or "hammer," used for driving it into the ground, and stealthily approaching her sleeping guest, with one well-directed blow drove the nail through his temples into the earth (<reflink target="XXX">Judg. 5:27</reflink>).

  <item id="James">
    <description>(1.) The son of Zebedee and Salome; an elder brother of John the apostle. He was one of the twelve. He was by trade a fisherman, in partnership with Peter (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 20:20; 27:56</reflink>). With John and Peter he was present at the transfiguration (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 17:1; Mark 9:2</reflink>), at the raising of Jairus's daughter (<reflink target="XXX">Mark 5:37-43</reflink>), and in the garden with our Lord (14:33). Because, probably, of their boldness and energy, he and John were called Boanerges, i.e., "sons of thunder." He was the first martyr among the apostles, having been beheaded by King Herod Agrippa (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 12:1, 2</reflink>), A.D. 44. (<reflink target="XXX">Comp. Matt. 4:21; 20:20-23</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(2.) The son of Alphaeus, or Cleopas, "the brother" or near kinsman or cousin of our Lord (<reflink target="XXX">Gal. 1:18, 19</reflink>), called James "the Less," or "the Little," probably because he was of low stature. He is mentioned along with the other apostles (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 10:3; Mark 3:18; Luke 6:15</reflink>). He had a separate interview with our Lord after his resurrection (<reflink target="XXX">1 Cor. 15:7</reflink>), and is mentioned as one of the apostles of the circumcision (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 1:13</reflink>). He appears to have occupied the position of head of the Church at Jerusalem, where he presided at the council held to consider the case of the Gentiles (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 12:17; 15:13-29: 21:18-24</reflink>). This James was the author of the epistle which bears his name.</description>

  <item id="James, Epistle of">
    <description>(1.) Author of, was James the Less, the Lord's brother, one of the twelve apostles. He was one of the three pillars of the Church (<reflink target="XXX">Gal. 2:9</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(2.) It was addressed to the Jews of the dispersion, "the twelve tribes scattered abroad."</description>
    <description>(3.) The place and time of the writing of the epistle were Jerusalem, where James was residing, and, from internal evidence, the period between Paul's two imprisonments at Rome, probably about A.D. 62.</description>
    <description>(4.) The object of the writer was to enforce the practical duties of the Christian life. "The Jewish vices against which he warns them are, formalism, which made the service of God consist in washings and outward ceremonies, whereas he reminds them (1:27) that it consists rather in active love and purity; fanaticism, which, under the cloak of religious zeal, was tearing Jerusalem in pieces (1:20); fatalism, which threw its sins on God (1:13); meanness, which crouched before the rich (2:2); falsehood, which had made words and oaths play-things (3:2-12); partisanship (3:14); evil speaking (4:11); boasting (4:16); oppression (5:4). The great lesson which he teaches them as Christians is patience, patience in trial (1:2), patience in good works (1:22-25), patience under provocation (3:17), patience under oppression (5:7), patience under persecution (5:10); and the ground of their patience is that the coming of the Lord draweth nigh, which is to right all wrong (5:8)."</description>
    <description>"Justification by works," which James contends for, is justification before man, the justification of our profession of faith by a consistent life. Paul contends for the doctrine of "justification by faith;" but that is justification before God, a being regarded and accepted as just by virtue of the righteousness of Christ, which is received by faith.</description>

He and his wife were two of the eight saved in the ark (<reflink target="XXX">1 Pet. 3:20</reflink>). He was the progenitor of many tribes inhabiting the east of Europe and the north of Asia (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 10:2-5</reflink>). An act of filial piety (9:20-27) was the occasion of Noah's prophecy of the extension of his posterity.</description>
    <description>After the Flood the earth was re-peopled by the descendants of Noah, "the sons of Japheth" (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 10:2</reflink>), "the sons of Ham" (6), and "the sons of Shem" (22). It is important to notice that modern ethnological science, reasoning from a careful analysis of facts, has arrived at the conclusion that there is a three-fold division of the human family, corresponding in a remarkable way with the great ethnological chapter of the book of Genesis (10). The three great races thus distinguished are called the Semitic, Aryan, and Turanian (Allophylian). "Setting aside the cases where the ethnic names employed are of doubtful application, it cannot reasonably be questioned that the author [of Gen. 10] has in his account of the sons of Japheth classed together the Cymry or Celts (Gomer), the Medes (Madai), and the Ionians or Greeks (Javan), thereby anticipating what has become known in modern times as the 'Indo-European Theory,' or the essential unity of the Aryan (Asiatic) race with the principal races of Europe, indicated by the Celts and the Ionians. Nor can it be doubted that he has thrown together under the one head of 'children of Shem' the Assyrians (Asshur), the Syrians (Aram), the Hebrews (Eber), and the Joktanian Arabs (Joktan), four of the principal races which modern ethnology recognizes under the heading of 'Semitic.' Again, under the heading of 'sons of Ham,' the author has arranged 'Cush', i.e., the Ethiopians; 'Mizraim,' the people of Egypt; 'Sheba and Dedan,' or certain of the Southern Arabs; and 'Nimrod,' or the ancient people of Babylon, four races between which the latest linguistic researches have established a close affinity" (Rawlinson's Hist.

We have only two specimens from the book, (1) the words of Joshua which he spake to the Lord at the crisis of the battle of Beth-horon (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 10:12, 13</reflink>); and (2) "the Song of the Bow," that beautiful and touching mournful elegy which David composed on the occasion of the death of Saul and Jonathan (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 1:18-27</reflink>).</description>

In verse 19 the Authorized Version reads, "God clave a hollow place that was in the jaw, and there came water thereout." This is a mis-translation of the words. The rendering should be as in the Revised Version, "God clave the hollow place that is in Lehi," etc., Lehi (q.v.) being the name of the hill where this conflict was waged, possibly so called because it was in shape like a jaw-bone.</description>

They were defeated by Joshua, and their king was slain; but they were not entirely driven out of Jebus till the time of David, who made it the capital of his kingdom instead of Hebron.

    <description>(2.) The son and successor of Jehu, king of Israel (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 10:35</reflink>). He reigned seventeen years, and followed the evil ways of the house of Jeroboam. The Syrians, under Hazael and Benhadad, prevailed over him, but were at length driven out of the land by his son Jehoash (13:1-9, 25).</description>
    <description>(3.) Josiah's third son, usually called Shallum (<reflink target="XXX">1 Chr. 3:15</reflink>). He succeeded his father on the throne, and reigned over Judah for three months (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 23:31, 34</reflink>). He fell into the idolatrous ways of his predecessors (23:32), was deposed by Pharaoh-Necho from the throne, and carried away prisoner into Egypt, where he died in captivity (23:33, 34; Jer. 22:10-12; 2 Chr. 36:1-4).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Jehoash">
    <description>Jehovah-given. (1.) The son of King Ahaziah. While yet an infant, he was saved from the general massacre of the family by his aunt Jehosheba, and was apparently the only surviving descendant of Solomon (<reflink target="XXX">2 Chr. 21:4, 17</reflink>). His uncle, the high priest Jehoiada, brought him forth to public notice when he was eight years of age, and crowned and anointed him king of Judah with the usual ceremonies. Athaliah was taken by surprise when she heard the shout of the people, "Long live the king;" and when she appeared in the temple, Jehoiada commanded her to be led forth to death (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 11:13-20</reflink>). While the high priest lived, Jehoash favoured the worship of God and observed the law; but on his death he fell away into evil courses, and the land was defiled with idolatry. Zechariah, the son and successor of the high priest, was put to death. These evil deeds brought down on the land the judgement of God, and it was oppressed by the Syrian invaders. He is one of the three kings omitted by Matthew (1:8) in the genealogy of Christ, the other two being Ahaziah and Amaziah. He was buried in the city of David (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 12:21</reflink>). (<see target="x-self">See JOASH [4].</see>)</description>
    <description>(2.) The son and successor of Jehoahaz, king of Israel (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 14:1; comp. 12:1; 13:10</reflink>). When he ascended the throne the kingdom was suffering from the invasion of the Syrians. Hazael "was cutting Israel short." He tolerated the worship of the golden calves, yet seems to have manifested a character of sincere devotion to the God of his fathers. He held the prophet Elisha in honour, and wept by his bedside when he was dying, addressing him in the words Elisha himself had used when Elijah was carried up into heaven: "O my father, my father, the chariot of Israel and the horsemen thereof." He was afterwards involved in war with Amaziah, the king of Judah (<reflink target="XXX">2 Chr. 25:23-24</reflink>), whom he utterly defeated at Beth-shemesh, on the borders of Dan and Philistia, and advancing on Jerusalem, broke down a portion of the wall, and carried away the treasures of the temple and the palace. He soon after died (B.C. 825), and was buried in Samaria (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 14:1-17, 19, 20</reflink>). He was succeeded by his son.

He is also called Jeconiah (<reflink target="XXX">Jer. 24:1; 27:20, etc.</reflink>), and Coniah (22:24; 37:1). He was succeeded by his uncle, Mattaniah = Zedekiah (q.v.). He was the last direct heir to the Jewish crown. He was carried captive to Babylon by Nebuchadnezzar, along with the flower of the nobility, all the leading men in Jerusalem, and a great body of the general population, some thirteen thousand in all (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 24:12-16; Jer. 52:28</reflink>). After an imprisonment of thirty-seven years (<reflink target="XXX">Jer. 52:31, 33</reflink>), he was liberated by Evil-merodach, and permitted to occupy a place in the king's household and sit at his table, receiving "every day a portion until the day of his death, all the days of his life" (52:32-34).</description>

He married Jehosheba, or Jehoshabeath, the daughter of king Jehoram (<reflink target="XXX">2 Chr. 22:11</reflink>), and took an active part along with his wife in the preservation and training of Jehoash when Athaliah slew all the royal family of Judah.</description>
    <description>The plans he adopted in replacing Jehoash on the throne of his ancestors are described in 2 Kings 11:2; 12:2; 2 Chr. 22:11; 23:24. He was among the foremost of the benefactors of the kingdom, and at his death was buried in the city of David among the kings of Judah (<reflink target="XXX">2 Chr. 24:15, 16</reflink>). He is said to have been one hundred and thirty years old.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Jehoiakim">
    <description>he whom Jehovah has set up, the second son of Josiah, and eighteenth king of Judah, which he ruled over for eleven years (B.C. 610-599). His original name was Eliakim (q.v.).</description>
    <description>On the death of his father his younger brother Jehoahaz (=Shallum, Jer. 22:11), who favoured the Chaldeans against the Egyptians, was made king by the people; but the king of Egypt, Pharaoh-necho, invaded the land and deposed Jehoahaz (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 23:33, 34; Jer. 22:10-12</reflink>), setting Eliakim on the throne in his stead, and changing his name to Jehoiakim.</description>
    <description>After this the king of Egypt took no part in Jewish politics, having been defeated by the Chaldeans at Carchemish (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 24:7; Jer. 46:2</reflink>). Palestine was now invaded and conquered by Nebuchadnezzar. Jehoiakim was taken prisoner and carried captive to Babylon (<reflink target="XXX">2 Chr. 36:6, 7</reflink>). It was at this time that Daniel also and his three companions were taken captive to Babylon (<reflink target="XXX">Dan. 1:1, 2</reflink>).</description>
    <description>Nebuchadnezzar reinstated Jehoiakim on his throne, but treated him as a vassal king. In the year after this, Jeremiah caused his prophecies to be read by Baruch in the court of the temple. Jehoiakim, hearing of this, had them also read in the royal palace before himself. The words displeased him, and taking the roll from the hands of Baruch he cut it in pieces and threw it into the fire (<reflink target="XXX">Jer. 36:23</reflink>). During his disastrous reign there was a return to the old idolatry and corruption of the days of Manasseh.</description>
    <description>After three years of subjection to Babylon, Jehoiakim withheld his tribute and threw off the yoke (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 24:1</reflink>), hoping to make himself independent. Nebuchadnezzar sent bands of Chaldeans, Syrians, and Ammonites (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 24:2</reflink>) to chastise his rebellious vassal. They cruelly harassed the whole country (<reflink target="XXX">comp. Jer. 49:1-6</reflink>). The king came to a violent death, and his body having been thrown over the wall of Jerusalem, to convince the beseieging army that he was dead, after having been dragged away, was buried beyond the gates of Jerusalem "with the burial of an ass," B.C. 599 (<reflink target="XXX">Jer. 22:18, 19; 36:30</reflink>). Nebuchadnezzar placed his son Jehoiachin on the throne, wishing still to retain the kingdom of Judah as tributary to him.</description>

    <description>(4.) The son of Ahab and Jezebel, and successor to his brother Ahaziah on the throne of Israel. He reigned twelve years, B.C. 896-884 (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 1:17; 3:1</reflink>). His first work was to reduce to subjection the Moabites, who had asserted their independence in the reign of his brother. Jehoshaphat, king of Judah, assisted Jehoram in this effort. He was further helped by his ally the king of Edom. Elisha went forth with the confederated army (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 3:1-19</reflink>), and at the solicitation of Jehoshaphat encouraged the army with the assurance from the Lord of a speedy victory. The Moabites under Mesha their king were utterly routed and their cities destroyed. At Kir-haraseth Mesha made a final stand. The Israelites refrained from pressing their victory further, and returned to their own land.</description>
    <description>Elisha afterwards again befriended Jehoram when a war broke out between the Syrians and Israel, and in a remarkable way brought that war to a bloodless close (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 6:23</reflink>). But Jehoram, becoming confident in his own power, sank into idolatry, and brought upon himself and his land another Syrian invasion, which led to great suffering and distress in Samaria (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 6:24-33</reflink>). By a remarkable providential interposition the city was saved from utter destruction, and the Syrians were put to flight (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 7:6-15</reflink>).</description>
    <description>Jehoram was wounded in a battle with the Syrians at Ramah, and obliged to return to Jezreel (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 8:29; 9:14, 15</reflink>), and soon after the army proclaimed their leader Jehu king of Israel, and revolted from their allegiance to Jehoram (2 Kings 9). Jehoram was pierced by an arrow from Jehu's bow on the piece of ground at Jezreel which Ahab had taken from Naboth, and there he died (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 9:21-29</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(5.) The eldest son and successor of Jehoshaphat, king of Judah. He reigned eight years (B.C. 892-885) alone as king of Judah, having been previously for some years associated with his father (<reflink target="XXX">2 Chr. 21:5, 20; 2 Kings 8:16</reflink>). His wife was Athaliah, the daughter of Ahab and Jezebel. His daughter Jehosheba was married to the high priest Jehoiada. He sank into gross idolatry, and brought upon himself and his kingdom the anger of Jehovah. The Edomites revolted from under his yoke, and the Philistines and the Arabians and Cushites invaded the land, and carried away great spoil, along with Jehoram's wives and all his children, except Ahaziah. He died a painful death from a fearful malady, and was refused a place in the sepulchre of the kings (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 8:16-24; 2 Chr. 21</reflink>).</description>

    <description>(3.) Son of Ahilud, "recorder" or annalist under David and Solomon (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 8:16</reflink>), a state officer of high rank, chancellor or vizier of the kingdom.</description>
    <description>(4.) Solomon's purveyor in Issachar (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 4:17</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(5.) The son and successor of Asa, king of Judah. After fortifying his kingdom against Israel (<reflink target="XXX">2 Chr. 17:1, 2</reflink>), he set himself to cleanse the land of idolatry (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 22:43</reflink>). In the third year of his reign he sent out priests and Levites over the land to instruct the people in the law (<reflink target="XXX">2 Chr. 17:7-9</reflink>). He enjoyed a great measure of peace and prosperity, the blessing of God resting on the people "in their basket and their store."</description>
    <description>The great mistake of his reign was his entering into an alliance with Ahab, the king of Israel, which involved him in much disgrace, and brought disaster on his kingdom (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 22:1-33</reflink>). Escaping from the bloody battle of Ramoth-gilead, the prophet Jehu (<reflink target="XXX">2 Chr. 19:1-3</reflink>) reproached him for the course he had been pursuing, whereupon he entered with rigour on his former course of opposition to all idolatry, and of deepening interest in the worship of God and in the righteous government of the people (<reflink target="XXX">2 Chr. 19:4-11</reflink>).</description>
    <description>Again he entered into an alliance with Ahaziah, the king of Israel, for the purpose of carrying on maritime commerce with Ophir. But the fleet that was then equipped at Ezion-gaber was speedily wrecked. A new fleet was fitted out without the co-operation of the king of Israel, and although it was successful, the trade was not prosecuted (<reflink target="XXX">2 Chr. 20:35-37; 1 Kings 22:48-49</reflink>).</description>
    <description>He subsequently joined Jehoram, king of Israel, in a war against the Moabites, who were under tribute to Israel. This war was successful. The Moabites were subdued; but the dreadful act of Mesha in offering his own son a sacrifice on the walls of Kir-haresheth in the sight of the armies of Israel filled him with horror, and he withdrew and returned to his own land (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 3:4-27</reflink>).</description>
    <description>The last most notable event of his reign was that recorded in 2 Chr. 20. The Moabites formed a great and powerful confederacy with the surrounding nations, and came against Jehoshaphat. The allied forces were encamped at Engedi. The king and his people were filled with alarm, and betook themselves to God in prayer. The king prayed in the court of the temple, "O our God, wilt thou not judge them? for we have no might against this great company that cometh against us." Amid the silence that followed, the voice of Jahaziel the Levite was heard announcing that on the morrow all this great host would be overthrown. So it was, for they quarrelled among themselves, and slew one another, leaving to the people of Judah only to gather the rich spoils of the slain. This was recognized as a great deliverance wrought for them by God (B.C. 890). Soon after this Jehoshaphat died, after a reign of twenty-five years, being sixty years of age, and was succeeded by his son Jehoram (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 22:50</reflink>). He had this testimony, that "he sought the Lord with all his heart" (<reflink target="XXX">2 Chr. 22:9</reflink>). The kingdom of Judah was never more prosperous than under his reign.</description>
    <description>(6.) The son of Nimshi, and father of Jehu, king of Israel (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 9:2, 14</reflink>).</description>

  <item id="Jehoshaphat, Valley of">
    <description>mentioned in Scripture only in Joel 3:2, 12. This is the name given in modern times to the valley between Jerusalem and the Mount of Olives, and the Kidron flows through it. Here Jehoshaphat overthrew the confederated enemies of Israel (<reflink target="XXX">Ps. 83:6-8</reflink>); and in this valley also God was to overthrow the Tyrians, Zidonians, etc. (<reflink target="XXX">Joel 3:4, 19</reflink>), with an utter overthrow. This has been fulfilled; but Joel speaks of the final conflict, when God would destroy all Jerusalem's enemies, of whom Tyre and Zidon, etc., were types. The "valley of Jehoshaphat" may therefore be simply regarded as a general term for the theatre of God's final judgments on the enemies of Israel.</description>
    <description>This valley has from ancient times been used by the Jews as a burial-ground. It is all over paved with flat stones as tombstones, bearing on them Hebrew inscriptions.</description>

  <item id="Jehosheba">
    <description>Jehovah-swearing, the daughter of Jehoram, the king of Israel. She is called Jehoshabeath in 2 Chr. 22:11. She was the only princess of the royal house who was married to a high priest, Jehoiada (<reflink target="XXX">2 Chr. 22:11</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Jehovah">
    <description>the special and significant name (not merely an appellative title such as Lord [adonai]) by which God revealed himself to the ancient Hebrews (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 6:2, 3</reflink>). This name, the Tetragrammaton of the Greeks, was held by the later Jews to be so sacred that it was never pronounced except by the high priest on the great Day of Atonement, when he entered into the most holy place. Whenever this name occurred in the sacred books they pronounced it, as they still do, "Adonai" (i.e., Lord), thus using another word in its stead. The Massorets gave to it the vowel-points appropriate to this word. This Jewish practice was founded on a false interpretation of Lev. 24:16. The meaning of the word appears from Ex. 3:14 to be "the unchanging, eternal, self-existent God," the "I am that I am," a convenant-keeping God. (<reflink target="XXX">Comp. Mal. 3:6; Hos. 12:5; Rev. 1:4, 8.</reflink>)</description>
    <description>The Hebrew name "Jehovah" is generally translated in the Authorized Version (and the Revised Version has not departed from this rule) by the word LORD printed in small capitals, to distinguish it from the rendering of the Hebrew _Adonai_ and the Greek _Kurios_, which are also rendered Lord, but printed in the usual type. The Hebrew word is translated "Jehovah" only in Ex. 6:3; Ps. 83:18; Isa. 12:2; 26:4, and in the compound names mentioned below.</description>
    <description>It is worthy of notice that this name is never used in the LXX., the Samaritan Pentateuch, the Apocrypha, or in the New Testament. It is found, however, on the "Moabite stone" (q.v.), and consequently it must have been in the days of Mesba so commonly pronounced by the Hebrews as to be familiar to their heathen neighbours.</description>

    <description>(4.) King of Israel, the son of Jehoshaphat (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 9:2</reflink>), and grandson of Nimshi. The story of his exaltation to the throne is deeply interesting. During the progress of a war against the Syrians, who were becoming more and more troublesome to Israel, in a battle at Ramoth-gilead Jehoram, the king of Israel, had been wounded; and leaving his army there, had returned to Jezreel, whither his ally, Ahaziah, king of Judah, had also gone on a visit of sympathy with him (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 8:28, 29</reflink>). The commanders, being left in charge of the conduct of the war, met in council; and while engaged in their deliberations, a messenger from Elisha appeared in the camp, and taking Jehu from the council, led him into a secret chamber, and there anointed him king over Israel, and immediately retired and disappeared (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 9:5, 6</reflink>). On being interrogated by his companions as to the object of this mysterious visitor, he informed them of what had been done, when immediately, with the utmost enthusiasm, they blew their trumpets and proclaimed him king (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 9:11-14</reflink>). He then with a chosen band set forth with all speed to Jezreel, where, with his own hand, he slew Jehoram, shooting him through the heart with an arrow (9:24). The king of Judah, when trying to escape, was fatally wounded by one of Jehu's soldiers at Beth-gan. On entering the city, Jehu commanded the eunchs of the royal palace to cast down Jezebel into the street, where her mangled body was trodden under foot by the horses. Jehu was now master of Jezreel, whence he communicated with the persons in authority in Samaria the capital, commanding them to appear before him on the morrow with the heads of all the royal princes of Samaria. Accordingly on the morrow seventy heads were piled up in two heaps at his gate. At "the shearing-house" (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 10:12-14</reflink>) other forty-two connected with the house of Ahab were put to death (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 10:14</reflink>). As Jehu rode on toward Samaria, he met Jehonadab (q.v.), whom he took into his chariot, and they entered the capital together. By a cunning stratagem he cut off all the worshippers of Baal found in Samaria (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 10:19-25</reflink>), and destroyed the temple of the idol (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 10:27</reflink>).</description>
    <description>Notwithstanding all this apparent zeal for the worship of Jehovah, Jehu yet tolerated the worship of the golden calves at Dan and Bethel. For this the divine displeasure rested upon him, and his kingdom suffered disaster in war with the Syrians (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 10:29-33</reflink>). He died after a reign of twenty-eight years (B.C. 884-856), and was buried in Samaria (10:34-36). "He was one of those decisive, terrible, and ambitious, yet prudent, calculating, and passionless men whom God from time to time raises up to change the fate of empires and execute his judgments on the earth." He was the first Jewish king who came in contact with the Assyrian power in the time of Shalmaneser II.</description>

    <description>whom God sets free, or the breaker through, a "mighty man of valour" who delivered Israel from the oppression of the Ammonites (<reflink target="XXX">Judg. 11:1-33</reflink>), and judged Israel six years (12:7). He has been described as "a wild, daring, Gilead mountaineer, a sort of warrior Elijah." After forty-five years of comparative quiet Israel again apostatized, and in "process of time the children of Ammon made war against Israel" (11:5). In their distress the elders of Gilead went to fetch Jephthah out of the land of Tob, to which he had fled when driven out wrongfully by his brothers from his father's inheritance (2), and the people made him their head and captain. The "elders of Gilead" in their extremity summoned him to their aid, and he at once undertook the conduct of the war against Ammon. Twice he sent an embassy to the king of Ammon, but in vain. War was inevitable. The people obeyed his summons, and "the spirit of the Lord came upon him." Before engaging in war he vowed that if successful he would offer as a "burnt-offering" whatever would come out of the door of his house first to meet him on his return. The defeat of the Ammonites was complete. "He smote them from Aroer, even till thou come to Minnith, even twenty cities, and unto the plain of the vineyards [Heb. 'Abel Keramim], with a very great slaughter" (<reflink target="XXX">Judg. 11:33</reflink>). The men of Ephraim regarded themselves as insulted in not having been called by Jephthah to go with him to war against Ammon. This led to a war between the men of Gilead and Ephraim (12:4), in which many of the Ephraimites perished. (<see target="x-self">See SHIBBOLETH.</see>) "Then died Jephthah the Gileadite, and was buried in one of the cities of Gilead" (7).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Jephthah's vow">
    <description>(<reflink target="XXX">Judg. 11:30, 31</reflink>). After a crushing defeat of the Ammonites, Jephthah returned to his own house, and the first to welcome him was his own daughter. This was a terrible blow to the victor, and in his despair he cried out, "Alas, my daughter! thou hast brought me very low...I have opened my mouth unto the Lord, and cannot go back." With singular nobleness of spirit she answered, "Do to me according to that which hath proceeded out of thy mouth." She only asked two months to bewail her maidenhood with her companions upon the mountains. She utters no reproach against her father's rashness, and is content to yield her life since her father has returned a conqueror. But was it so? Did Jephthah offer up his daughter as a "burnt-offering"? This question has been much debated, and there are many able commentators who argue that such a sacrifice was actually offered. We are constrained, however, by a consideration of Jephthah's known piety as a true worshipper of Jehovah, his evident acquaintance with the law of Moses, to which such sacrifices were abhorrent (<reflink target="XXX">Lev. 18:21; 20:2-5; Deut. 12:31</reflink>), and the place he holds in the roll of the heroes of the faith in the Epistle to the Hebrews (11:32), to conclude that she was only doomed to a life of perpetual celibacy.</description>

He was called to the prophetical office when still young (1:6), in the thirteenth year of Josiah (B.C. 628). He left his native place, and went to reside in Jerusalem, where he greatly assisted Josiah in his work of reformation (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 23:1-25</reflink>). The death of this pious king was bewailed by the prophet as a national calamity (<reflink target="XXX">2 Chr. 35:25</reflink>).</description>
    <description>During the three years of the reign of Jehoahaz we find no reference to Jeremiah, but in the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim the enmity of the people against him broke out in bitter persecution, and he was placed apparently under restraint (<reflink target="XXX">Jer. 36:5</reflink>). In the fourth year of Jehoiakim he was commanded to write the predictions given to him, and to read them to the people on the fast-day. This was done by Baruch his servant in his stead, and produced much public excitement. The roll was read to the king. In his recklessness he seized the roll, and cut it to pieces, and cast it into the fire, and ordered both Baruch and Jeremiah to be apprehended. Jeremiah procured another roll, and wrote in it the words of the roll the king had destroyed, and "many like words" besides (<reflink target="XXX">Jer. 36:32</reflink>).</description>
    <description>He remained in Jerusalem, uttering from time to time his words of warning, but without effect. He was there when Nebuchadnezzar besieged the city (<reflink target="XXX">Jer. 37:4, 5</reflink>), B.C. 589. The rumour of the approach of the Egyptians to aid the Jews in this crisis induced the Chaldeans to withdraw and return to their own land. This, however, was only for a time. The prophet, in answer to his prayer, received a message from God announcing that the Chaldeans would come again and take the city, and burn it with fire (37:7, 8). The princes, in their anger at such a message by Jeremiah, cast him into prison (37:15-38:13). He was still in confinement when the city was taken (B.C. 588). The Chaldeans released him, and showed him great kindness, allowing him to choose the place of his residence. He accordingly went to Mizpah with Gedaliah, who had been made governor of Judea. Johanan succeeded Gedaliah, and refusing to listen to Jeremiah's counsels, went down into Egypt, taking Jeremiah and Baruch with him (<reflink target="XXX">Jer. 43:6</reflink>). There probably the prophet spent the remainder of his life, in vain seeking still to turn the people to the Lord, from whom they had so long revolted (44). He lived till the reign of Evil-Merodach, son of Nebuchadnezzar, and must have been about ninety years of age at his death. We have no authentic record of his death. He may have died at Tahpanhes, or, according to a tradition, may have gone to Babylon with the army of Nebuchadnezzar; but of this there is nothing certain.</description>

Two sections picturing the hopes of better times, (1.) ch. 30, 31; (2.) ch. 32,33; to which is added an historical appendix in three sections, (1.) ch. 34:1-7; (2.) ch. 34:8-22; (3.) ch. 35. V. The conclusion, in two sections, (1.) ch. 36; (2.) ch. 45.</description>
    <description>In Egypt, after an interval, Jeremiah is supposed to have added three sections, viz., ch. 37-39; 40-43; and 44.</description>
    <description>The principal Messianic prophecies are found in 23:1-8; 31:31-40; and 33:14-26.</description>
    <description>Jeremiah's prophecies are noted for the frequent repetitions found in them of the same words and phrases and imagery. They cover the period of about 30 years. They are not recorded in the order of time. When and under what circumstances this book assumed its present form we know not.</description>
    <description>The LXX. Version of this book is, in its arrangement and in other particulars, singularly at variance with the original. The LXX. omits 10:6-8; 27:19-22; 29:16-20; 33:14-26; 39:4-13; 52:2, 3, 15, 28-30, etc. About 2,700 words in all of the original are omitted. These omissions, etc., are capricious and arbitrary, and render the version unreliable.</description>

  <item id="Jericho">
    <description>place of fragrance, a fenced city in the midst of a vast grove of palm trees, in the plain of Jordan, over against the place where that river was crossed by the Israelites (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 3:16</reflink>). Its site was near the 'Ain es-Sultan, Elisha's Fountain (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 2:19-22</reflink>), about 5 miles west of Jordan. It was the most important city in the Jordan valley (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 22:1; 34:15</reflink>), and the strongest fortress in all the land of Canaan. It was the key to Western Palestine.</description>
    <description>This city was taken in a very remarkable manner by the Israelites (Josh. 6). God gave it into their hands. The city was "accursed" (Heb. herem, "devoted" to Jehovah), and accordingly (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 6:17; comp. Lev. 27:28, 29; Deut. 13:16</reflink>) all the inhabitants and all the spoil of the city were to be destroyed, "only the silver, and the gold, and the vessels of brass and of iron" were reserved and "put into the treasury of the house of Jehovah" (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 6:24; comp. Num. 31:22, 23, 50-54</reflink>). Only Rahab "and her father's household, and all that she had," were preserved from destruction, according to the promise of the spies (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 2:14</reflink>). In one of the Amarna tablets Adoni-zedec (q.v.) writes to the king of Egypt informing him that the 'Abiri (Hebrews) had prevailed, and had taken the fortress of Jericho, and were plundering "all the king's lands." It would seem that the Egyptian troops had before this been withdrawn from Palestine.</description>
    <description>This city was given to the tribe of Benjamin (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 18:21</reflink>), and it was inhabited in the time of the Judges (<reflink target="XXX">Judg. 3:13; 2 Sam. 10:5</reflink>). It is not again mentioned till the time of David (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 10:5</reflink>). "Children of Jericho" were among the captives who returned under Zerubbabel Ezra 2:34; Neh. 7:36). Hiel (q.v.) the Bethelite attempted to make it once more a fortified city (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 16:34</reflink>). Between the beginning and the end of his undertaking all his children were cut off.</description>
    <description>In New Testament times Jericho stood some distance to the south-east of the ancient one, and near the opening of the valley of Achor. It was a rich and flourishing town, having a considerable trade, and celebrated for the palm trees which adorned the plain around. It was visited by our Lord on his last journey to Jerusalem. Here he gave sight to two blind men (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 20:29-34; Mark 10:46-52</reflink>), and brought salvation to the house of Zacchaeus the publican (<reflink target="XXX">Luke 19:2-10</reflink>).</description>
    <description>The poor hamlet of er-Riha, the representative of modern Jericho, is situated some two miles farther to the east. It is in a ruinous condition, having been destroyed by the Turks in 1840. "The soil of the plain," about the middle of which the ancient city stood, "is unsurpassed in fertility; there is abundance of water for irrigation, and many of the old aqueducts are almost perfect; yet nearly the whole plain is waste and desolate...The climate of Jericho is exceedingly hot and unhealthy. This is accounted for by the depression of the plain, which is about 1,200 feet below the level of the sea."</description>
    <description>There were three different Jerichos, on three different sites, the Jericho of Joshua, the Jericho of Herod, and the Jericho of the Crusades. Er-Riha, the modern Jericho, dates from the time of the Crusades. Dr. Bliss has found in a hollow scooped out for some purpose or other near the foot of the biggest mound above the Sultan's Spring specimens of Amorite or pre-Israelitish pottery precisely identical with what he had discovered on the site of ancient Lachish. He also traced in this place for a short distance a mud brick wall in situ, which he supposes to be the very wall that fell before the trumpets of Joshua. The wall is not far from the foot of the great precipice of Quarantania and its numerous caverns, and the spies of Joshua could easily have fled from the city and been speedily hidden in these fastnesses.</description>

    <description>increase of the people. (1.) The son of Nebat (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 11:26-39</reflink>), "an Ephrathite," the first king of the ten tribes, over whom he reigned twenty-two years (B.C. 976-945). He was the son of a widow of Zereda, and while still young was promoted by Solomon to be chief superintendent of the "burnden", i.e., of the bands of forced labourers. Influenced by the words of the prophet Ahijah, he began to form conspiracies with the view of becoming king of the ten tribes; but these having been discovered, he fled to Egypt (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 11:29-40</reflink>), where he remained for a length of time under the protection of Shishak I. On the death of Solomon, the ten tribes, having revolted, sent to invite him to become their king. The conduct of Rehoboam favoured the designs of Jeroboam, and he was accordingly proclaimed "king of Israel" (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 12: 1-20</reflink>). He rebuilt and fortified Shechem as the capital of his kingdom. He at once adopted means to perpetuate the division thus made between the two parts of the kingdom, and erected at Dan and Bethel, the two extremities of his kingdom, "golden calves," which he set up as symbols of Jehovah, enjoining the people not any more to go up to worship at Jerusalem, but to bring their offerings to the shrines he had erected. Thus he became distinguished as the man "who made Israel to sin." This policy was followed by all the succeeding kings of Israel.</description>
    <description>While he was engaged in offering incense at Bethel, a prophet from Judah appeared before him with a warning message from the Lord. Attempting to arrest the prophet for his bold words of defiance, his hand was "dried up," and the altar before which he stood was rent asunder. At his urgent entreaty his "hand was restored him again" (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 13:1-6, 9; comp. 2 Kings 23:15</reflink>); but the miracle made no abiding impression on him. His reign was one of constant war with the house of Judah. He died soon after his son Abijah (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 14:1-18</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(2.) Jeroboam II., the son and successor of Jehoash, and the fourteenth king of Israel, over which he ruled for forty-one years, B.C. 825-784 (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 14:23</reflink>). He followed the example of the first Jeroboam in keeping up the worship of the golden calves (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 14:24</reflink>). His reign was contemporary with those of Amaziah (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 14:23</reflink>) and Uzziah (15:1), kings of Judah. He was victorious over the Syrians (13:4; 14:26, 27), and extended Israel to its former limits, from "the entering of Hamath to the sea of the plain" (14:25; Amos 6:14). His reign of forty-one years was the most prosperous that Israel had ever known as yet. With all this outward prosperity, however, iniquity widely prevailed in the land (<reflink target="XXX">Amos 2:6-8; 4:1; 6:6; Hos. 4:12-14</reflink>). The prophets Hosea (1:1), Joel (3:16; Amos 1:1, 2), Amos (1:1), and Jonah (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 14:25</reflink>) lived during his reign. He died, and was buried with his ancestors (14:29). He was succeeded by his son Zachariah (q.v.).</description>
    <description>His name occurs in Scripture only in 2 Kings 13:13; 14:16, 23, 27, 28, 29; 15:1, 8; 1 Chr. 5:17; Hos. 1:1; Amos 1:1; 7:9, 10, 11. In all other passages it is Jeroboam the son of Nebat that is meant.</description>

  <item id="Jerusalem">
    <description>called also Salem, Ariel, Jebus, the "city of God," the "holy city;" by the modern Arabs el-Khuds, meaning "the holy;" once "the city of Judah" (<reflink target="XXX">2 Chr. 25:28</reflink>). This name is in the original in the dual form, and means "possession of peace," or "foundation of peace." The dual form probably refers to the two mountains on which it was built, viz., Zion and Moriah; or, as some suppose, to the two parts of the city, the "upper" and the "lower city." Jerusalem is a "mountain city enthroned on a mountain fastness" (<reflink target="XXX">comp. Ps. 68:15, 16; 87:1; 125:2; 76:1, 2; 122:3</reflink>). It stands on the edge of one of the highest table-lands in Palestine, and is surrounded on the south-eastern, the southern, and the western sides by deep and precipitous ravines.</description>
    <description>It is first mentioned in Scripture under the name Salem (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 14:18; comp. Ps. 76:2</reflink>). When first mentioned under the name Jerusalem, Adonizedek was its king (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 10:1</reflink>). It is afterwards named among the cities of Benjamin (<reflink target="XXX">Judg. 19:10; 1 Chr. 11:4</reflink>); but in the time of David it was divided between Benjamin and Judah. After the death of Joshua the city was taken and set on fire by the men of Judah (<reflink target="XXX">Judg. 1:1-8</reflink>); but the Jebusites were not wholly driven out of it. The city is not again mentioned till we are told that David brought the head of Goliath thither (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 17:54</reflink>). David afterwards led his forces against the Jebusites still residing within its walls, and drove them out, fixing his own dwelling on Zion, which he called "the city of David" (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 5:5-9; 1 Chr. 11:4-8</reflink>). Here he built an altar to the Lord on the threshing-floor of Araunah the Jebusite (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 24:15-25</reflink>), and thither he brought up the ark of the covenant and placed it in the new tabernacle which he had prepared for it. Jerusalem now became the capital of the kingdom.</description>
    <description>After the death of David, Solomon built the temple, a house for the name of the Lord, on Mount Moriah (B.C. 1010). He also greatly strengthened and adorned the city, and it became the great centre of all the civil and religious affairs of the nation (<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 12:5; comp. 12:14; 14:23; 16:11-16; Ps. 122</reflink>).</description>
    <description>After the disruption of the kingdom on the accession to the throne of Rehoboam, the son of Solomon, Jerusalem became the capital of the kingdom of the two tribes. It was subsequently often taken and retaken by the Egyptians, the Assyrians, and by the kings of Israel (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 14:13, 14; 18:15, 16; 23:33-35; 24:14; 2 Chr. 12:9; 26:9; 27:3, 4; 29:3; 32:30; 33:11</reflink>), till finally, for the abounding iniquities of the nation, after a siege of three years, it was taken and utterly destroyed, its walls razed to the ground, and its temple and palaces consumed by fire, by Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon (2 Kings 25; 2 Chr. 36; Jer. 39), B.C. 588. The desolation of the city and the land was completed by the retreat of the principal Jews into Egypt (Jer. 40-44), and by the final carrying captive into Babylon of all that still remained in the land (52:3), so that it was left without an inhabitant (B.C. 582). Compare the predictions, Deut. 28; Lev. 26:14-39.</description>
    <description>But the streets and walls of Jerusalem were again to be built, in troublous times (<reflink target="XXX">Dan. 9:16, 19, 25</reflink>), after a captivity of seventy years. This restoration was begun B.C. 536, "in the first year of Cyrus" (<reflink target="XXX">Ezra 1:2, 3, 5-11</reflink>). The Books of Ezra and Nehemiah contain the history of the re-building of the city and temple, and the restoration of the kingdom of the Jews, consisting of a portion of all the tribes. The kingdom thus constituted was for two centuries under the dominion of Persia, till B.C. 331; and thereafter, for about a century and a half, under the rulers of the Greek empire in Asia, till B.C. 167. For a century the Jews maintained their independence under native rulers, the Asmonean princes. At the close of this period they fell under the rule of Herod and of members of his family, but practically under Rome, till the time of the destruction of Jerusalem, A.D. 70. The city was then laid in ruins.</description>
    <description>The modern Jerusalem by-and-by began to be built over the immense beds of rubbish resulting from the overthrow of the ancient city; and whilst it occupies certainly the same site, there are no evidences that even the lines of its streets are now what they were in the ancient city. Till A.D. 131 the Jews who still lingered about Jerusalem quietly submitted to the Roman sway. But in that year the emperor (Hadrian), in order to hold them in subjection, rebuilt and fortified the city. The Jews, however, took possession of it, having risen under the leadership of one Bar-Chohaba (i.e., "the son of the star") in revolt against the Romans. Some four years afterwards (A.D. 135), however, they were driven out of it with great slaughter, and the city was again destroyed; and over its ruins was built a Roman city called Aelia Capitolina, a name which it retained till it fell under the dominion of the Mohammedans, when it was called el-Khuds, i.e., "the holy."</description>
    <description>In A.D. 326 Helena, mother of the emperor Constantine, made a pilgrimage to Jerusalem with the view of discovering the places mentioned in the life of our Lord. She caused a church to be built on what was then supposed to be the place of the nativity at Bethlehem. Constantine, animated by her example, searched for the holy sepulchre, and built over the supposed site a magnificent church, which was completed and dedicated A.D. 335. He relaxed the laws against the Jews till this time in force, and permitted them once a year to visit the city and wail over the desolation of "the holy and beautiful house."</description>
    <description>In A.D. 614 the Persians, after defeating the Roman forces of the emperor Heraclius, took Jerusalem by storm, and retained it till A.D. 637, when it was taken by the Arabians under the Khalif Omar. It remained in their possession till it passed, in A.D. 960, under the dominion of the Fatimite khalifs of Egypt, and in A.D. 1073 under the Turcomans. In A.D. 1099 the crusader Godfrey of Bouillon took the city from the Moslems with great slaughter, and was elected king of Jerusalem. He converted the Mosque of Omar into a Christian cathedral. During the eighty-eight years which followed, many churches and convents were erected in the holy city. The Church of the Holy Sepulchre was rebuilt during this period, and it alone remains to this day. In A.D. 1187 the sultan Saladin wrested the city from the Christians. From that time to the present day, with few intervals, Jerusalem has remained in the hands of the Moslems. It has, however, during that period been again and again taken and retaken, demolished in great part and rebuilt, no city in the world having passed through so many vicissitudes.</description>
    <description>In the year 1850 the Greek and Latin monks residing in Jerusalem had a fierce dispute about the guardianship of what are called the "holy places." In this dispute the emperor Nicholas of Russia sided with the Greeks, and Louis Napoleon, the emperor of the French, with the Latins. This led the Turkish authorities to settle the question in a way unsatisfactory to Russia. Out of this there sprang the Crimean War, which was protracted and sanguinary, but which had important consequences in the way of breaking down the barriers of Turkish exclusiveness.</description>
    <description>Modern Jerusalem "lies near the summit of a broad mountain-ridge, which extends without interruption from the plain of Esdraelon to a line drawn between the southern end of the Dead Sea and the southeastern corner of the Mediterranean." This high, uneven table-land is everywhere from 20 to 25 geographical miles in breadth. It was anciently known as the mountains of Ephraim and Judah.</description>
    <description>"Jerusalem is a city of contrasts, and differs widely from Damascus, not merely because it is a stone town in mountains, whilst the latter is a mud city in a plain, but because while in Damascus Moslem religion and Oriental custom are unmixed with any foreign element, in Jerusalem every form of religion, every nationality of East and West, is represented at one time."</description>
    <description>Jerusalem is first mentioned under that name in the Book of Joshua, and the Tell-el-Amarna collection of tablets includes six letters from its Amorite king to Egypt, recording the attack of the Abiri about B.C. 1480. The name is there spelt Uru-Salim ("city of peace"). Another monumental record in which the Holy City is named is that of Sennacherib's attack in B.C. 702. The "camp of the Assyrians" was still shown about A.D. 70, on the flat ground to the north-west, included in the new quarter of the city.</description>
    <description>The city of David included both the upper city and Millo, and was surrounded by a wall built by David and Solomon, who appear to have restored the original Jebusite fortifications. The name Zion (or Sion) appears to have been, like Ariel ("the hearth of God"), a poetical term for Jerusalem, but in the Greek age was more specially used of the Temple hill. The priests' quarter grew up on Ophel, south of the Temple, where also was Solomon's Palace outside the original city of David. The walls of the city were extended by Jotham and Manasseh to include this suburb and the Temple (<reflink target="XXX">2 Chr. 27:3; 33:14</reflink>).</description>
    <description>Jerusalem is now a town of some 50,000 inhabitants, with ancient mediaeval walls, partly on the old lines, but extending less far to the south. The traditional sites, as a rule, were first shown in the 4th and later centuries A.D., and have no authority. The results of excavation have, however, settled most of the disputed questions, the limits of the Temple area, and the course of the old walls having been traced.</description>

    <description>The life of Jesus on earth may be divided into two great periods, (1) that of his private life, till he was about thirty years of age; and (2) that of his public life, which lasted about three years.</description>
    <description>In the "fulness of time" he was born at Bethlehem, in the reign of the emperor Augustus, of Mary, who was betrothed to Joseph, a carpenter (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 1:1; Luke 3:23; comp. John 7:42</reflink>). His birth was announced to the shepherds (<reflink target="XXX">Luke 2:8-20</reflink>). Wise men from the east came to Bethlehem to see him who was born "King of the Jews," bringing gifts with them (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 2:1-12</reflink>). Herod's cruel jealousy led to Joseph's flight into Egypt with Mary and the infant Jesus, where they tarried till the death of this king (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 2:13-23</reflink>), when they returned and settled in Nazareth, in Lower Galilee (2:23; comp. Luke 4:16; John 1:46, etc.). At the age of twelve years he went up to Jerusalem to the Passover with his parents. There, in the temple, "in the midst of the doctors," all that heard him were "astonished at his understanding and answers" (<reflink target="XXX">Luke 2:41, etc.</reflink>).</description>
    <description>Eighteen years pass, of which we have no record beyond this, that he returned to Nazareth and "increased in wisdom and stature, and in favour with God and man" (<reflink target="XXX">Luke 2:52</reflink>).</description>
    <description>He entered on his public ministry when he was about thirty years of age. It is generally reckoned to have extended to about three years. "Each of these years had peculiar features of its own. (1.) The first year may be called the year of obscurity, both because the records of it which we possess are very scanty, and because he seems during it to have been only slowly emerging into public notice. It was spent for the most part in Judea. (2.) The second year was the year of public favour, during which the country had become thoroughly aware of him; his activity was incessant, and his frame rang through the length and breadth of the land. It was almost wholly passed in Galilee. (3.) The third was the year of opposition, when the public favour ebbed away. His enemies multiplied and assailed him with more and more pertinacity, and at last he fell a victim to their hatred. The first six months of this final year were passed in Galilee, and the last six in other parts of the land.", Stalker's Life of Jesus Christ, p. 45.</description>

On the following day Jethro, observing the multiplicity of the duties devolving on Moses, advised him to appoint subordinate judges, rulers of thousands, of hundreds, of fifties, and of tens, to decide smaller matters, leaving only the weightier matters to be referred to Moses, to be laid before the Lord. This advice Moses adopted (Ex. 18). He was also called Hobab (q.v.), which was probably his personal name, while Jethro was an official name. (<see target="x-self">See MOSES.</see>)</description>

    <description>During the Captivity, and after the Restoration, the name, however, was extended to all the Hebrew nation without distinction (<reflink target="XXX">Esther 3:6, 10; Dan. 3:8, 12; Ezra 4:12; 5:1, 5</reflink>).</description>
    <description>Originally this people were called Hebrews (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 39:14; 40:15; Ex. 2:7; 3:18; 5:3; 1 Sam. 4:6, 9, etc.</reflink>), but after the Exile this name fell into disuse. But Paul was styled a Hebrew (<reflink target="XXX">2 Cor. 11:22; Phil. 3:5</reflink>).</description>
    <description>The history of the Jewish nation is interwoven with the history of Palestine and with the narratives of the lives of their rulers and chief men. They are now [1897] dispersed over all lands, and to this day remain a separate people, "without a king, and without a prince, and without a sacrifice, and without an image [R.V. 'pillar,' marg. 'obelisk'], and without an ephod, and without teraphim" (<reflink target="XXX">Hos. 3:4</reflink>). Till about the beginning of the present century [1800] they were everywhere greatly oppressed, and often cruelly persecuted; but now their condition is greatly improved, and they are admitted in most European countries to all the rights of free citizens. In 1860 the "Jewish disabilities" were removed, and they were admitted to a seat in the British Parliament. Their number in all is estimated at about six millions, about four millions being in Europe.</description>
    <description>There are three names used in the New Testament to designate this people, (1.) Jews, as regards their nationality, to distinguish them from Gentiles. (2.) Hebrews, with regard to their language and education, to distinguish them from Hellenists, i.e., Jews who spoke the Greek language. (3.) Israelites, as respects their sacred privileges as the chosen people of God. "To other races we owe the splendid inheritance of modern civilization and secular culture; but the religious education of mankind has been the gift of the Jew alone."</description>

    <description>chaste, the daughter of Ethbaal, the king of the Zidonians, and the wife of Ahab, the king of Israel (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 16:31</reflink>). This was the "first time that a king of Israel had allied himself by marriage with a heathen princess; and the alliance was in this case of a peculiarly disastrous kind. Jezebel has stamped her name on history as the representative of all that is designing, crafty, malicious, revengeful, and cruel. She is the first great instigator of persecution against the saints of God. Guided by no principle, restrained by no fear of either God or man, passionate in her attachment to her heathen worship, she spared no pains to maintain idolatry around her in all its splendour. Four hundred and fifty prophets ministered under her care to Baal, besides four hundred prophets of the groves [R.V., 'prophets of the Asherah'], which ate at her table (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 18:19</reflink>). The idolatry, too, was of the most debased and sensual kind." Her conduct was in many respects very disastrous to the kingdom both of Israel and Judah (21:1-29). At length she came to an untimely end. As Jehu rode into the gates of Jezreel, she looked out at the window of the palace, and said, "Had Zimri peace, who slew his master?" He looked up and called to her chamberlains, who instantly threw her from the window, so that she was dashed in pieces on the street, and his horses trod her under their feet. She was immediately consumed by the dogs of the street (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 9:7-37</reflink>), according to the word of Elijah the Tishbite (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 21:19</reflink>).</description>
    <description>Her name afterwards came to be used as the synonym for a wicked woman (<reflink target="XXX">Rev. 2: 20</reflink>).</description>

    <description>Jehovah is his father. (1.)

His father's name is nowhere mentioned, although his sepulchre at Bethlehem is mentioned (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 2:32</reflink>). His two brothers were Abishai and Asahel, the swift of foot, who was killed by Abner (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 2:13-32</reflink>), whom Joab afterwards treacherously murdered (3:22-27). He afterwards led the assault at the storming of the fortress on Mount Zion, and for this service was raised to the rank of "prince of the king's army" (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 5:6-10; 1 Chr. 27:34</reflink>). His chief military achievements were, (1) against the allied forces of Syria and Ammon; (2) against Edom (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 11:15, 16</reflink>); and (3) against the Ammonites (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 10:7-19; 11:1, 11</reflink>). His character is deeply stained by the part he willingly took in the murder of Uriah (11:14-25). He acted apparently from a sense of duty in putting Absalom to death (18:1-14). David was unmindful of the many services Joab had rendered to him, and afterwards gave the command of the army to Amasa, Joab's cousin (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 20:1-13; 19:13</reflink>). When David was dying Joab espoused the cause of Adonijah in preference to that of Solomon. He was afterwards slain by Benaiah, by the command of Solomon, in accordance with his father's injunction (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 3:29; 20:5-13</reflink>), at the altar to which he had fled for refuge. Thus this hoary conspirator died without one to lift up a voice in his favour. He was buried in his own property in the "wilderness," probably in the north-east of Jerusalem (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 2:5, 28-34</reflink>).

His history, so far as it is known, is recorded in his book.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Job, Book of">
    <description>A great diversity of opinion exists as to the authorship of this book. From internal evidence, such as the similarity of sentiment and language to those in the Psalms and Proverbs (<see target="x-self">see Ps. 88 and 89</see>), the prevalence of the idea of "wisdom," and the style and character of the composition, it is supposed by some to have been written in the time of David and Solomon. Others argue that it was written by Job himself, or by Elihu, or Isaiah, or perhaps more probably by Moses, who was "learned in all the wisdom of the Egyptians, and mighty in words and deeds" (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 7:22</reflink>). He had opportunities in Midian for obtaining the knowledge of the facts related. But the authorship is altogether uncertain.</description>
    <description>As to the character of the book, it is a historical poem, one of the greatest and sublimest poems in all literature. Job was a historical person, and the localities and names were real and not fictious. It is "one of the grandest portions of the inspired Scriptures, a heavenly-repleished storehouse of comfort and instruction, the patriarchal Bible, and a precious monument of primitive theology. It is to the Old Testament what the Epistle to the Romans is to the New." It is a didactic narrative in a dramatic form.</description>
    <description>This book was apparently well known in the days of Ezekiel, B.C. 600 (<reflink target="XXX">Ezek. 14:14</reflink>). It formed a part of the sacred Scriptures used by our Lord and his apostles, and is referred to as a part of the inspired Word (<reflink target="XXX">Heb. 12:5; 1 Cor. 3:19</reflink>).</description>
    <description>The subject of the book is the trial of Job, its occasion, nature, endurance, and issue. It exhibits the harmony of the truths of revelation and the dealings of Providence, which are seen to be at once inscrutable, just, and merciful. It shows the blessedness of the truly pious, even amid sore afflictions, and thus ministers comfort and hope to tried believers of every age. It is a book of manifold instruction, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, and for instruction in righteousness (<reflink target="XXX">2 Tim. 3:16</reflink>).</description>
    <description>It consists of,</description>
    <description>(1.) An historical introduction in prose (ch. 1,2).</description>
    <description>(2.) The controversy and its solution, in poetry (ch. 3-42:6).</description>
    <description>Job's desponding lamentation (ch. 3) is the occasion of the controversy which is carried on in three courses of dialogues between Job and his three friends. The first course gives the commencement of the controversy (ch. 4-14); the second the growth of the controversy (15-21); and the third the height of the controversy (22-27). This is followed by the solution of the controversy in the speeches of Elihu and the address of Jehovah, followed by Job's humble confession (42:1-6) of his own fault and folly.</description>
    <description>(3.) The third division is the historical conclusion, in prose (42:7-15).</description>
    <description>Sir J. W. Dawson in "The Expositor" says: "It would now seem that the language and theology of the book of Job can be better explained by supposing it to be a portion of Minean [Southern Arabia] literature obtained by Moses in Midian than in any other way. This view also agrees better than any other with its references to natural objects, the art of mining, and other matters."</description>

A prophecy of a great public calamity then impending over the land, consisting of a want of water and an extraordinary plague of locusts (1:1-2:11). (2.) The prophet then calls on his countrymen to repent and to turn to God, assuring them of his readiness to forgive (2:12-17), and foretelling the restoration of the land to its accustomed fruitfulness (18-26). (3.) Then follows a Messianic prophecy, quoted by Peter (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 2:39</reflink>). (4.)

He warned Gedaliah of the plans of Ishmael against him, a warning which was unheeded (<reflink target="XXX">Jer. 40:13, 16</reflink>). He afterwards pursued the murderer of the governor, and rescued the captives (41:8, 13, 15, 16). He and his associates subsequently fled to Tahpanhes in Egypt (43:2, 4, 5), taking Jeremiah with them. "The flight of Gedaliah's community to Egypt extinguished the last remaining spark of life in the Jewish state.

    <description>(2.) The Hebrew name of Mark (q.v.). He is designated by this name in the acts of the Apostles (12:12, 25; 13:5, 13; 15:37).</description>
    <description>(3.) THE APOSTLE, brother of James the "Greater" (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 4:21; 10:2; Mark 1:19; 3:17; 10:35</reflink>). He was one, probably the younger, of the sons of Zebedee (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 4:21</reflink>) and Salome (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 27:56; comp. Mark 15:40</reflink>), and was born at Bethsaida. His father was apparently a man of some wealth (<reflink target="XXX">comp. Mark 1:20; Luke 5:3; John 19:27</reflink>). He was doubtless trained in all that constituted the ordinary education of Jewish youth. When he grew up he followed the occupation of a fisherman on the Lake of Galilee. When John the Baptist began his ministry in the wilderness of Judea, John, with many others, gathered round him, and was deeply influenced by his teaching. There he heard the announcement, "Behold the Lamb of God," and forthwith, on the invitation of Jesus, became a disciple and ranked among his followers (<reflink target="XXX">John 1:36, 37</reflink>) for a time. He and his brother then returned to their former avocation, for how long is uncertain. Jesus again called them (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 4: 21; Luke 5:1-11</reflink>), and now they left all and permanently attached themselves to the company of his disciples. He became one of the innermost circle (<reflink target="XXX">Mark 5:37; Matt. 17:1; 26:37; Mark 13:3</reflink>). He was the disciple whom Jesus loved. In zeal and intensity of character he was a "Boanerges" (<reflink target="XXX">Mark 3:17</reflink>). This spirit once and again broke out (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 20:20-24; Mark 10:35-41; Luke 9:49, 54</reflink>). At the betrayal he and Peter follow Christ afar off, while the others betake themselves to hasty flight (<reflink target="XXX">John 18:15</reflink>). At the trial he follows Christ into the council chamber, and thence to the praetorium (18:16, 19, 28) and to the place of crucifixion (19:26, 27). To him and Peter, Mary first conveys tidings of the resurrection (20:2), and they are the first to go and see what her strange words mean. After the resurrection he and Peter again return to the Sea of Galilee, where the Lord reveals himself to them (21:1, 7). We find Peter and John frequently after this together (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 3:1; 4:13</reflink>). John remained apparently in Jerusalem as the leader of the church there (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 15:6; Gal. 2:9</reflink>). His subsequent history is unrecorded. He was not there, however, at the time of Paul's last visit (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 21:15-40</reflink>). He appears to have retired to Ephesus, but at what time is unknown. The seven churches of Asia were the objects of his special care (<reflink target="XXX">Rev. 1:11</reflink>). He suffered under persecution, and was banished to Patmos (1:9); whence he again returned to Ephesus, where he died, probably about A.D. 98, having outlived all or nearly all the friends and companions even of his maturer years. There are many interesting traditions regarding John during his residence at Ephesus, but these cannot claim the character of historical truth.</description>

    <description>the "forerunner of our Lord." We have but fragmentary and imperfect accounts of him in the Gospels. He was of priestly descent. His father, Zacharias, was a priest of the course of Abia (<reflink target="XXX">1 Chr. 24:10</reflink>), and his mother, Elisabeth, was of the daughters of Aaron (<reflink target="XXX">Luke 1:5</reflink>). The mission of John was the subject of prophecy (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 3:3; Isa. 40:3; Mal. 3:1</reflink>). His birth, which took place six months before that of Jesus, was foretold by an angel. Zacharias, deprived of the power of speech as a token of God's truth and a reproof of his own incredulity with reference to the birth of his son, had the power of speech restored to him on the occasion of his circumcision (<reflink target="XXX">Luke 1:64</reflink>). After this no more is recorded of him for thirty years than what is mentioned in Luke 1:80. John was a Nazarite from his birth (<reflink target="XXX">Luke 1:15; Num. 6:1-12</reflink>). He spent his early years in the mountainous tract of Judah lying between Jerusalem and the Dead Sea (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 3:1-12</reflink>).</description>
    <description>At length he came forth into public life, and great multitudes from "every quarter" were attracted to him. The sum of his preaching was the necessity of repentance. He denounced the Sadducees and Pharisees as a "generation of vipers," and warned them of the folly of trusting to external privileges (<reflink target="XXX">Luke 3:8</reflink>). "As a preacher, John was eminently practical and discriminating. Self-love and covetousness were the prevalent sins of the people at large. On them, therefore, he enjoined charity and consideration for others. The publicans he cautioned against extortion, the soldiers against crime and plunder." His doctrine and manner of life roused the entire south of Palestine, and the people from all parts flocked to the place where he was, on the banks of the Jordan. There he baptized thousands unto repentance.</description>
    <description>The fame of John reached the ears of Jesus in Nazareth (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 3:5</reflink>), and he came from Galilee to Jordan to be baptized of John, on the special ground that it became him to "fulfil all righteousness" (3:15). John's special office ceased with the baptism of Jesus, who must now "increase" as the King come to his kingdom. He continued, however, for a while to bear testimony to the Messiahship of Jesus. He pointed him out to his disciples, saying, "Behold the Lamb of God." His public ministry was suddenly (after about six months probably) brought to a close by his being cast into prison by Herod, whom he had reproved for the sin of having taken to himself the wife of his brother Philip (<reflink target="XXX">Luke 3:19</reflink>). He was shut up in the castle of Machaerus (q.v.), a fortress on the southern extremity of Peraea, 9 miles east of the Dead Sea, and here he was beheaded. His disciples, having consigned the headless body to the grave, went and told Jesus all that had occurred (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 14:3-12</reflink>). John's death occurred apparently just before the third Passover of our Lord's ministry. Our Lord himself testified regarding him that he was a "burning and a shining light" (<reflink target="XXX">John 5:35</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="John, First Epistle of">
    <description>the fourth of the catholic or "general" epistles. It was evidently written by John the evangelist, and probably also at Ephesus, and when the writer was in advanced age. The purpose of the apostle (1:1-4) is to declare the Word of Life to those to whom he writes, in order that they might be united in fellowship with the Father and his Son Jesus Christ. He shows that the means of union with God are, (1) on the part of Christ, his atoning work (1:7; 2:2; 3:5; 4:10, 14; 5:11, 12) and his advocacy (2:1); and (2), on the part of man, holiness (1:6), obedience (2:3), purity (3:3), faith (3:23; 4:3; 5:5), and love (2:7, 8; 3:14; 4:7; 5:1).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="John, Gospel of">
    <description>The genuineness of this Gospel, i.e., the fact that the apostle John was its author, is beyond all reasonable doubt. In recent times, from about 1820, many attempts have been made to impugn its genuineness, but without success.</description>
    <description>The design of John in writing this Gospel is stated by himself (<reflink target="XXX">John 20:31</reflink>). It was at one time supposed that he wrote for the purpose of supplying the omissions of the synoptical, i.e., of the first three, Gospels, but there is no evidence for this. "There is here no history of Jesus and his teaching after the manner of the other evangelists. But there is in historical form a representation of the Christian faith in relation to the person of Christ as its central point; and in this representation there is a picture on the one hand of the antagonism of the world to the truth revealed in him, and on the other of the spiritual blessedness of the few who yield themselves to him as the Light of life" (Reuss).</description>
    <description>After the prologue (1:1-5), the historical part of the book begins with verse 6, and consists of two parts. The first part (1:6-ch. 12) contains the history of our Lord's public ministry from the time of his introduction to it by John the Baptist to its close. The second part (ch. 13-21) presents our Lord in the retirement of private life and in his intercourse with his immediate followers (13-17), and gives an account of his sufferings and of his appearances to the disciples after his resurrection (18-21).</description>
    <description>The peculiarities of this Gospel are the place it gives (1) to the mystical relation of the Son to the Father, and (2) of the Redeemer to believers; (3) the announcement of the Holy Ghost as the Comforter; (4) the prominence given to love as an element in the Christian character. It was obviously addressed primarily to Christians.</description>
    <description>It was probably written at Ephesus, which, after the destruction of Jerusalem (A.D. 70), became the centre of Christian life and activity in the East, about A.D. 90.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="John, Second Epistle of">
    <description>is addressed to "the elect lady," and closes with the words, "The children of thy elect sister greet thee;" but some would read instead of "lady" the proper name Kyria. Of the thirteen verses composing this epistle seven are in the First Epistle. The person addressed is commended for her piety, and is warned against false teachers.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="John, Third Epistle of">
    <description>is addressed to Caius, or Gaius, but whether to the Christian of that name in Macedonia (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 19: 29</reflink>) or in Corinth (<reflink target="XXX">Rom. 16:23</reflink>) or in Derbe (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 20:4</reflink>) is uncertain. It was written for the purpose of commending to Gaius some Christians who were strangers in the place where he lived, and who had gone thither for the purpose of preaching the gospel (ver. 7).</description>
    <description>The Second and Third Epistles were probably written soon after the First, and from Ephesus.</description>

  <item id="Jonah">
    <description>a dove, the son of Amittai of Gath-hepher. He was a prophet of Israel, and predicted the restoration of the ancient boundaries (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 14:25-27</reflink>) of the kingdom. He exercised his ministry very early in the reign of Jeroboam II., and thus was contemporary with Hosea and Amos; or possibly he preceded them, and consequently may have been the very oldest of all the prophets whose writings we possess. His personal history is mainly to be gathered from the book which bears his name. It is chiefly interesting from the two-fold character in which he appears, (1) as a missionary to heathen Nineveh, and (2) as a type of the "Son of man."</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Jonah, Book of">
    <description>This book professes to give an account of what actually took place in the experience of the prophet. Some critics have sought to interpret the book as a parable or allegory, and not as a history. They have done so for various reasons. Thus (1) some reject it on the ground that the miraculous element enters so largely into it, and that it is not prophetical but narrative in its form; (2) others, denying the possibility of miracles altogether, hold that therefore it cannot be true history.</description>
    <description>Jonah and his story is referred to by our Lord (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 12:39, 40; Luke 11:29</reflink>), a fact to which the greatest weight must be attached. It is impossible to interpret this reference on any other theory. This one argument is of sufficient importance to settle the whole question. No theories devised for the purpose of getting rid of difficulties can stand against such a proof that the book is a veritable history.</description>
    <description>There is every reason to believe that this book was written by Jonah himself. It gives an account of (1) his divine commission to go to Nineveh, his disobedience, and the punishment following (1:1-17); (2) his prayer and miraculous deliverance (1:17-2:10); (3) the second commission given to him, and his prompt obedience in delivering the message from God, and its results in the repentance of the Ninevites, and God's long-sparing mercy toward them (ch. 3); (4) Jonah's displeasure at God's merciful decision, and the rebuke tendered to the impatient prophet (ch. 4). Nineveh was spared after Jonah's mission for more than a century. The history of Jonah may well be regarded "as a part of that great onward movement which was before the Law and under the Law; which gained strength and volume as the fulness of the times drew near.", Perowne's Jonah.</description>

  <item id="Jonathan">
    <description>whom Jehovah gave, the name of fifteen or more persons that are mentioned in Scripture. The chief of these are, (1.) A Levite descended from Gershom (<reflink target="XXX">Judg. 18:30</reflink>). His history is recorded in 17:7-13 and 18:30. The Rabbins changed this name into Manasseh "to screen the memory of the great lawgiver from the stain of having so unworthy an apostate among his near descendants." He became priest of the idol image at Dan, and this office continued in his family till the Captivity.</description>
    <description>(2.) The eldest son of king Saul, and the bosom friend of David. He is first mentioned when he was about thirty years of age, some time after his father's accession to the throne (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 13:2</reflink>). Like his father, he was a man of great strength and activity (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 1:23</reflink>), and excelled in archery and slinging (<reflink target="XXX">1 Chr. 12:2;2 Sam. 1:22</reflink>). The affection that evidently subsisted between him and his father was interrupted by the growth of Saul's insanity. At length, "in fierce anger," he left his father's presence and cast in his lot with the cause of David (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 20:34</reflink>). After an eventful career, interwoven to a great extent with that of David, he fell, along with his father and his two brothers, on the fatal field of Gilboa (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 31:2, 8</reflink>). He was first buried at Jabesh-gilead, but his remains were afterwards removed with those of his father to Zelah, in Benjamin (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 21:12-14</reflink>). His death was the occasion of David's famous elegy of "the Song of the Bow" (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 1:17-27</reflink>). He left one son five years old, Merib-baal, or Mephibosheth (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 4:4; comp. 1 Chr. 8:34</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(3.) Son of the high priest Abiathar, and one who adhered to David at the time of Absalom's rebellion (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 15:27, 36</reflink>). He is the last descendant of Eli of whom there is any record.</description>
    <description>(4.) Son of Shammah, and David's nephew, and also one of his chief warriors (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 21:21</reflink>). He slew a giant in Gath.</description>

  <item id="Joppa">
    <description>beauty, a town in the portion of Dan (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 19:46; A.V., "Japho"</reflink>), on a sandy promontory between Caesarea and Gaza, and at a distance of 30 miles north-west from Jerusalem. It is one of the oldest towns in Asia. It was and still is the chief sea-port of Judea. It was never wrested from the Phoenicians. It became a Jewish town only in the second century B.C. It was from this port that Jonah "took ship to flee from the presence of the Lord" (<reflink target="XXX">Jonah 1:3</reflink>). To this place also the wood cut in Lebanon by Hiram's men for Solomon was brought in floats (<reflink target="XXX">2 Chr. 2:16</reflink>); and here the material for the building of the second temple was also landed (<reflink target="XXX">Ezra 3:7</reflink>). At Joppa, in the house of Simon the tanner, "by the sea-side," Peter resided "many days," and here, "on the house-top," he had his "vision of tolerance" (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 9:36-43</reflink>). It bears the modern name of Jaffa, and exibituds all the decrepitude and squalor of cities ruled over by the Turks. "Scarcely any other town has been so often overthrown, sacked, pillaged, burned, and rebuilt." Its present population is said to be about 16,000. It was taken by the French under Napoleon in 1799, who gave orders for the massacre here of 4,000 prisoners. It is connected with Jerusalem by the only carriage road that exists in the country, and also by a railway completed in 1892. It is noticed on monuments B.C. 1600-1300, and was attacked by Sannacharib B.C. 702.</description>

  <item id="Jordan">
    <description>Heb. Yarden, "the descender;" Arab. Nahr-esh-Sheriah, "the watering-place" the chief river of Palestine. It flows from north to south down a deep valley in the centre of the country. The name descender is significant of the fact that there is along its whole course a descent to its banks; or it may simply denote the rapidity with which it "descends" to the Dead Sea.</description>
    <description>It originates in the snows of Hermon, which feed its perennial fountains. Two sources are generally spoken of. (1.) From the western base of a hill on which once stood the city of Dan, the northern border-city of Palestine, there gushes forth a considerable fountain called the Leddan, which is the largest fountain in Syria and the principal source of the Jordan. (2.) Beside the ruins of Banias, the ancient Caesarea Philippi and the yet more ancient Panium, is a lofty cliff of limestone, at the base of which is a fountain. This is the other source of the Jordan, and has always been regarded by the Jews as its true source. It rushes down to the plain in a foaming torrent, and joins the Leddan about 5 miles south of Dan (Tell-el-Kady). (3.) But besides these two historical fountains there is a third, called the Hasbany, which rises in the bottom of a valley at the western base of Hermon, 12 miles north of Tell-el-Kady. It joins the main stream about a mile below the junction of the Leddan and the Banias. The river thus formed is at this point about 45 feet wide, and flows in a channel from 12 to 20 feet below the plain. After this it flows, "with a swift current and a much-twisted course," through a marshy plain for some 6 miles, when it falls into the Lake Huleh, "the waters of Merom" (q.v.).</description>
    <description>During this part of its course the Jordan has descended about 1,100 feet. At Banias it is 1,080 feet above sea-level. Flowing from the southern extremity of Lake Huleh, here almost on a level with the sea, it flows for 2 miles "through a waste of islets and papyrus," and then for 9 miles through a narrow gorge in a foaming torrent onward to the Sea of Galilee (q.v.).</description>
    <description>"In the whole valley of the Jordan from the Lake Huleh to the Sea of Galilee there is not a single settled inhabitant. Along the whole eastern bank of the river and the lakes, from the base of Hermon to the ravine of Hieromax, a region of great fertility, 30 miles long by 7 or 8 wide, there are only some three inhabited villages. The western bank is almost as desolate. Ruins are numerous enough. Every mile or two is an old site of town or village, now well nigh hid beneath a dense jungle of thorns and thistles. The words of Scripture here recur to us with peculiar force: 'I will make your cities waste, and bring your sanctuaries unto desolation...And I will bring the land into desolation: and your enemies which dwell therein shall be astonished at it...And your land shall be desolate, and your cities waste. Then shall the land enjoy her sabbaths, as long as it lieth desolate' (<reflink target="XXX">Lev. 26:31-34</reflink>).", Dr. Porter's Handbook.</description>
    <description>From the Sea of Galilee, at the level of 682 feet below the Mediterranean, the river flows through a long, low plain called "the region of Jordan" (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 3:5</reflink>), and by the modern Arabs the Ghor, or "sunken plain." This section is properly the Jordan of Scripture. Down through the midst of the "plain of Jordan" there winds a ravine varying in breadth from 200 yards to half a mile, and in depth from 40 to 150 feet. Through it the Jordan flows in a rapid, rugged, tortuous course down to the Dead Sea. The whole distance from the southern extremity of the Sea of Galilee to the Dead Sea is in a straight line about 65 miles, but following the windings of the river about 200 miles, during which it falls 618 feet. The total length of the Jordan from Banias is about 104 miles in a straight line, during which it falls 2,380 feet.</description>
    <description>There are two considerable affluents which enter the river between the Sea of Galilee and the Dead Sea, both from the east. (1.) The Wady Mandhur, called the Yarmuk by the Rabbins and the Hieromax by the Greeks. It formed the boundary between Bashan and Gilead. It drains the plateau of the Hauran. (2.) The Jabbok or Wady Zerka, formerly the northern boundary of Ammon. It enters the Jordan about 20 miles north of Jericho.</description>
    <description>The first historical notice of the Jordan is in the account of the separation of Abraham and Lot (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 13:10</reflink>). "Lot beheld the plain of Jordan as the garden of the Lord." Jacob crossed and recrossed "this Jordan" (32:10). The Israelites passed over it as "on dry ground" (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 3:17; Ps. 114:3</reflink>). Twice afterwards its waters were miraculously divided at the same spot by Elijah and Elisha (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 2:8, 14</reflink>).</description>
    <description>The Jordan is mentioned in the Old Testament about one hundred and eighty times, and in the New Testament fifteen times. The chief events in gospel history connected with it are (1) John the Baptist's ministry, when "there went out to him Jerusalem, and all Judaea, and were baptized of him in Jordan" (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 3:6</reflink>). (2.) Jesus also "was baptized of John in Jordan" (<reflink target="XXX">Mark 1:9</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Joseph">
    <description>remover or increaser. (1.) The elder of the two sons of Jacob by Rachel (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 30:23, 24</reflink>), who, on the occasion of his birth, said, "God hath taken away [Heb. 'asaph] my reproach." "The Lord shall add [Heb. yoseph] to me another son" (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 30:24</reflink>). He was a child of probably six years of age when his father returned from Haran to Canaan and took up his residence in the old patriarchal town of Hebron. "Now Israel loved Joseph more than all his children, because he was the son of his old age," and he "made him a long garment with sleeves" (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 37:3, R.V. marg.</reflink>), i.e., a garment long and full, such as was worn by the children of nobles. This seems to be the correct rendering of the words. The phrase, however, may also be rendered, "a coat of many pieces", i.e., a patchwork of many small pieces of divers colours.</description>
    <description>When he was about seventeen years old Joseph incurred the jealous hatred of his brothers (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 37:4</reflink>). They "hated him, and could not speak peaceably unto him." Their anger was increased when he told them his dreams (37:11).</description>
    <description>Jacob desiring to hear tidings of his sons, who had gone to Shechem with their flocks, some 60 miles from Hebron, sent Joseph as his messenger to make inquiry regarding them. Joseph found that they had left Shechem for Dothan, whither he followed them. As soon as they saw him coming they began to plot against him, and would have killed him had not Reuben interposed. They ultimately sold him to a company of Ishmaelite merchants for twenty pieces (shekels) of silver (about $2, 10s.), ten pieces less than the current value of a slave, for "they cared little what they had for him, if so be they were rid of him." These merchants were going down with a varied assortment of merchandise to the Egyptian market, and thither they conveyed him, and ultimately sold him as a slave to Potiphar, an "officer of Pharaoh's, and captain of the guard" (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 37:36</reflink>). "The Lord blessed the Egyptian's house for Joseph's sake," and Potiphar made him overseer over his house. At length a false charge having been brought against him by Potiphar's wife, he was at once cast into the state prison (39; 40), where he remained for at least two years. After a while the "chief of the cupbearers" and the "chief of the bakers" of Pharaoh's household were cast into the same prison (40:2). Each of these new prisoners dreamed a dream in the same night, which Joseph interpreted, the event occurring as he had said.</description>
    <description>This led to Joseph's being remembered subsequently by the chief butler when Pharaoh also dreamed. At his suggestion Joseph was brought from prison to interpret the king's dreams. Pharaoh was well pleased with Joseph's wisdom in interpreting his dreams, and with his counsel with reference to the events then predicted; and he set him over all the land of Egypt (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 41:46</reflink>), and gave him the name of Zaphnath-paaneah. He was married to Asenath, the daughter of the priest of On, and thus became a member of the priestly class. Joseph was now about thirty years of age.</description>
    <description>As Joseph had interpreted, seven years of plenty came, during which he stored up great abundance of corn in granaries built for the purpose. These years were followed by seven years of famine "over all the face of the earth," when "all countries came into Egypt to Joseph to buy corn" (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 41:56, 57; 47:13, 14</reflink>). Thus "Joseph gathered up all the money that was in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, for the corn which they bought." Afterwards all the cattle and all the land, and at last the Egyptians themselves, became the property of Pharaoh.</description>
    <description>During this period of famine Joseph's brethren also came down to Egypt to buy corn. The history of his dealings with them, and of the manner in which he at length made himself known to them, is one of the most interesting narratives that can be read (Gen. 42-45). Joseph directed his brethren to return and bring Jacob and his family to the land of Egypt, saying, "I will give you the good of the land of Egypt, and ye shall eat the fat of the land. Regard not your stuff; for the good of all the land is yours." Accordingly Jacob and his family, to the number of threescore and ten souls, together with "all that they had," went down to Egypt. They were settled in the land of Goshen, where Joseph met his father, and "fell on his neck, and wept on his neck a good while" (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 46:29</reflink>).</description>
    <description>The excavations of Dr. Naville have shown the land of Goshen to be the Wady Tumilat, between Ismailia and Zagazig. In Goshen (Egyptian Qosem) they had pasture for their flocks, were near the Asiatic frontier of Egypt, and were out of the way of the Egyptian people. An inscription speaks of it as a district given up to the wandering shepherds of Asia.</description>
    <description>Jacob at length died, and in fulfilment of a promise which he had exacted, Joseph went up to Canaan to bury his father in "the field of Ephron the Hittite" (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 47:29-31; 50:1-14</reflink>). This was the last recorded act of Joseph, who again returned to Egypt.</description>
    <description>"The 'Story of the Two Brothers,' an Egyptian romance written for the son of the Pharaoh of the Oppression, contains an episode very similar to the Biblical account of Joseph's treatment by Potiphar's wife. Potiphar and Potipherah are the Egyptian Pa-tu-pa-Ra, 'the gift of the sun-god.' The name given to Joseph, Zaphnath-paaneah, is probably the Egyptian Zaf-nti-pa-ankh, 'nourisher of the living one,' i.e., of the Pharaoh. There are many instances in the inscriptions of foreigners in Egypt receiving Egyptian names, and rising to the highest offices of state."</description>
    <description>By his wife Asenath, Joseph had two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 41:50</reflink>). Joseph having obtained a promise from his brethren that when the time should come that God would "bring them unto the land which he sware to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob," they would carry up his bones out of Egypt, at length died, at the age of one hundred and ten years; and "they embalmed him, and he was put in a coffin" (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 50:26</reflink>). This promise was faithfully observed. Their descendants, long after, when the Exodus came, carried the body about with them during their forty years' wanderings, and at length buried it in Shechem, in the parcel of ground which Jacob bought from the sons of Hamor (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 24:32; comp. Gen. 33:19</reflink>). With the death of Joseph the patriarchal age of the history of Israel came to a close.</description>
    <description>The Pharaoh of Joseph's elevation was probably Apepi, or Apopis, the last of the Hyksos kings. Some, however, think that Joseph came to Egypt in the reign of Thothmes III. (<see target="x-self">see PHARAOH</see>), long after the expulsion of the Hyksos.</description>
    <description>The name Joseph denotes the two tribes of Ephraim and Manasseh in Deut. 33:13-17; the kingdom of Israel in Ezek. 37:16, 19, Amos 5:6; and the whole covenant people of Israel in Ps. 81:4.</description>
    <description>(2.) One of the sons of Asaph, head of the first division of sacred musicians (<reflink target="XXX">1 Chr. 25:2, 9</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(3.) The son of Judah, and father of Semei (<reflink target="XXX">Luke 3:26</reflink>). Other two of the same name in the ancestry of Christ are also mentioned (3:24, 30).</description>
    <description>(4.) The foster-father of our Lord (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 1:16; Luke 3:23</reflink>). He lived at Nazareth in Galilee (<reflink target="XXX">Luke 2:4</reflink>). He is called a "just man." He was by trade a carpenter (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 13:55</reflink>). He is last mentioned in connection with the journey to Jerusalem, when Jesus was twelve years old. It is probable that he died before Jesus entered on his public ministry. This is concluded from the fact that Mary only was present at the marriage feast in Cana of Galilee. His name does not appear in connection with the scenes of the crucifixion along with that of Mary (q.v.), John 19:25.</description>
    <description>(5.) A native of Arimathea, probably the Ramah of the Old Testament (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 1:19</reflink>), a man of wealth, and a member of the Sanhedrim (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 27:57; Luke 23:50</reflink>), an "honourable counsellor, who waited for the kingdom of God." As soon as he heard the tidings of Christ's death, he "went in boldly" (lit. "having summoned courage, he went") "unto Pilate, and craved the body of Jesus." Pilate having ascertained from the centurion that the death had really taken place, granted Joseph's request, who immediately, having purchased fine linen (<reflink target="XXX">Mark 15:46</reflink>), proceeded to Golgotha to take the body down from the cross. There, assisted by Nicodemus, he took down the body and wrapped it in the fine linen, sprinkling it with the myrrh and aloes which Nicodemus had brought (<reflink target="XXX">John 19:39</reflink>), and then conveyed the body to the new tomb hewn by Joseph himself out of a rock in his garden hard by. There they laid it, in the presence of Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of Joses, and other women, and rolled a great stone to the entrance, and departed (<reflink target="XXX">Luke 23:53, 55</reflink>). This was done in haste, "for the Sabbath was drawing on" (<reflink target="XXX">comp. Isa. 53:9</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(6.) Surnamed Barsabas (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 1:23</reflink>); also called Justus. He was one of those who "companied with the apostles all the time that the Lord Jesus went out and in among them" (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 1:21</reflink>), and was one of the candidates for the place of Judas.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Joshua">
    <description>Jehovah is his help, or Jehovah the Saviour. The son of Nun, of the tribe of Ephraim, the successor of Moses as the leader of Israel. He is called Jehoshua in Num. 13:16 (A.V.), and Jesus in Acts 7:45 and Heb. 4:8 (R.V., Joshua).</description>
    <description>He was born in Egypt, and was probably of the age of Caleb, with whom he is generally associated. He shared in all the events of the Exodus, and held the place of commander of the host of the Israelites at their great battle against the Amalekites in Rephidim (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 17:8-16</reflink>). He became Moses' minister or servant, and accompanied him part of the way when he ascended Mount Sinai to receive the two tables (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 32:17</reflink>). He was also one of the twelve who were sent on by Moses to explore the land of Canaan (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 13:16, 17</reflink>), and only he and Caleb gave an encouraging report. Under the direction of God, Moses, before his death, invested Joshua in a public and solemn manner with authority over the people as his successor (<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 31:23</reflink>). The people were encamped at Shittim when he assumed the command (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 1:1</reflink>); and crossing the Jordan, they encamped at Gilgal, where, having circumcised the people, he kept the Passover, and was visited by the Captain of the Lord's host, who spoke to him encouraging words (1:1-9).</description>
    <description>Now began the wars of conquest which Joshua carried on for many years, the record of which is in the book which bears his name. Six nations and thirty-one kings were conquered by him (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 11:18-23; 12:24</reflink>). Having thus subdued the Canaanites, Joshua divided the land among the tribes, Timnath-serah in Mount Ephraim being assigned to himself as his own inheritance. (<see target="x-self">See SHILOH; PRIEST.</see>)</description>
    <description>His work being done, he died, at the age of one hundred and ten years, twenty-five years after having crossed the Jordan. He was buried in his own city of Timnath-serah (Josh. 24); and "the light of Israel for the time faded away."</description>
    <description>Joshua has been regarded as a type of Christ (<reflink target="XXX">Heb. 4:8</reflink>) in the following particulars: (1) In the name common to both; (2) Joshua brings the people into the possession of the Promised Land, as Jesus brings his people to the heavenly Canaan; and (3) as Joshua succeeded Moses, so the Gospel succeeds the Law.</description>
    <description>The character of Joshua is thus well sketched by Edersheim:, "Born a slave in Egypt, he must have been about forty years old at the time of the Exodus. Attached to the person of Moses, he led Israel in the first decisive battle against Amalek (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 17:9, 13</reflink>), while Moses in the prayer of faith held up to heaven the God-given 'rod.' It was no doubt on that occasion that his name was changed from Oshea, 'help,' to Jehoshua, 'Jehovah is help' (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 13:16</reflink>). And this name is the key to his life and work. Alike in bringing the people into Canaan, in his wars, and in the distribution of the land among the tribes, from the miraculous crossing of Jordan and taking of Jericho to his last address, he was the embodiment of his new name, 'Jehovah is help.' To this outward calling his character also corresponded. It is marked by singleness of purpose, directness, and decision...He sets an object before him, and unswervingly follows it" (Bible Hist., iii. 103)</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Joshua, The Book of">
    <description>contains a history of the Israelites from the death of Moses to that of Joshua. It consists of three parts: (1.) The history of the conquest of the land (1-12). (2.) The allotment of the land to the different tribes, with the appointment of cities of refuge, the provision for the Levites (13-22), and the dismissal of the eastern tribes to their homes. This section has been compared to the Domesday Book of the Norman conquest. (3.) The farewell addresses of Joshua, with an account of his death (23, 24).</description>
    <description>This book stands first in the second of the three sections, (1) the Law, (2) the Prophets, (3) the "other writings" = Hagiographa, into which the Jewish Church divided the Old Testament. There is every reason for concluding that the uniform tradition of the Jews is correct when they assign the authorship of the book to Joshua, all except the concluding section; the last verses (24:29-33) were added by some other hand.</description>
    <description>There are two difficulties connected with this book which have given rise to much discussion, (1.) The miracle of the standing still of the sun and moon on Gibeon. The record of it occurs in Joshua's impassioned prayer of faith, as quoted (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 10:12-15</reflink>) from the "Book of Jasher" (q.v.). There are many explanations given of these words. They need, however, present no difficulty if we believe in the possibility of God's miraculous interposition in behalf of his people. Whether it was caused by the refraction of the light, or how, we know not.</description>
    <description>(2.) Another difficulty arises out of the command given by God utterly to exterminate the Canaanites. "Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?" It is enough that Joshua clearly knew that this was the will of God, who employs his terrible agencies, famine, pestilence, and war, in the righteous government of this world. The Canaanites had sunk into a state of immorality and corruption so foul and degrading that they had to be rooted out of the land with the edge of the sword. "The Israelites' sword, in its bloodiest executions, wrought a work of mercy for all the countries of the earth to the very end of the world."</description>
    <description>This book resembles the Acts of the Apostles in the number and variety of historical incidents it records, and in its many references to persons and places; and as in the latter case the epistles of Paul (<see target="x-self">see Paley's Horae Paul.</see>) confirm its historical accuracy by their incidental allusions and "undesigned coincidences," so in the former modern discoveries confirm its historicity. The Amarna tablets (<see target="x-self">see ADONIZEDEC</see>) are among the most remarkable discoveries of the age. Dating from about B.C. 1480 down to the time of Joshua, and consisting of official communications from Amorite, Phoenician, and Philistine chiefs to the king of Egypt, they afford a glimpse into the actual condition of Palestine prior to the Hebrew invasion, and illustrate and confirm the history of the conquest. A letter, also still extant, from a military officer, "master of the captains of Egypt," dating from near the end of the reign of Rameses II., gives a curious account of a journey, probably official, which he undertook through Palestine as far north as to Aleppo, and an insight into the social condition of the country at that time. Among the things brought to light by this letter and the Amarna tablets is the state of confusion and decay that had now fallen on Egypt. The Egyptian garrisons that had held possession of Palestine from the time of Thothmes III., some two hundred years before, had now been withdrawn. The way was thus opened for the Hebrews. In the history of the conquest there is no mention of Joshua having encountered any Egyptian force. The tablets contain many appeals to the king of Egypt for help against the inroads of the Hebrews, but no help seems ever to have been sent. Is not this just such a state of things as might have been anticipated as the result of the disaster of the Exodus? In many points, as shown under various articles, the progress of the conquest is remarkably illustrated by the tablets. The value of modern discoveries in their relation to Old Testament history has been thus well described:</description>
    <description>"The difficulty of establishing the charge of lack of historical credibility, as against the testimony of the Old Testament, has of late years greatly increased. The outcome of recent excavations and explorations is altogether against it. As long as these books contained, in the main, the only known accounts of the events they mention, there was some plausibility in the theory that perhaps these accounts were written rather to teach moral lessons than to preserve an exact knowledge of events. It was easy to say in those times men had not the historic sense. But the recent discoveries touch the events recorded in the Bible at very many different points in many different generations, mentioning the same persons, countries, peoples, events that are mentioned in the Bible, and showing beyond question that these were strictly historic. The point is not that the discoveries confirm the correctness of the Biblical statements, though that is commonly the case, but that the discoveries show that the peoples of those ages had the historic sense, and, specifically, that the Biblical narratives they touch are narratives of actual occurrences."</description>

  <item id="Josiah">
    <description>healed by Jehovah, or Jehovah will support. The son of Amon, and his successor on the throne of Judah (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 22:1; 2 Chr. 34:1</reflink>). His history is contained in 2 Kings 22, 23. He stands foremost among all the kings of the line of David for unswerving loyalty to Jehovah (23:25). He "did that which was right in the sight of the Lord, and walked in all the way of David his father." He ascended the throne at the early age of eight years, and it appears that not till eight years afterwards did he begin "to seek after the God of David his father." At that age he devoted himself to God. He distinguished himself by beginning a war of extermination against the prevailing idolatry, which had practically been the state religion for some seventy years (<reflink target="XXX">2 Chr. 34:3; comp. Jer. 25:3, 11, 29</reflink>).</description>
    <description>In the eighteenth year of his reign he proceeded to repair and beautify the temple, which by time and violence had become sorely dilapidated (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 22:3, 5, 6; 23:23; 2 Chr. 34:11</reflink>). While this work was being carried on, Hilkiah, the high priest, discovered a roll, which was probably the original copy of the law, the entire Pentateuch, written by Moses.</description>
    <description>When this book was read to him, the king was alarmed by the things it contained, and sent for Huldah, the "prophetess," for her counsel. She spoke to him words of encouragement, telling him that he would be gathered to his fathers in peace before the threatened days of judgment came. Josiah immediately gathered the people together, and engaged them in a renewal of their ancient national covenant with God. The Passover was then celebrated, as in the days of his great predecessor, Hezekiah, with unusual magnificence. Nevertheless, "the Lord turned not from the fierceness of his great wrath wherewith his anger was kindled against Judah" (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 22:3-20; 23:21-27; 2 Chr. 35:1-19</reflink>). During the progress of this great religious revolution Jeremiah helped it on by his earnest exhortations.</description>
    <description>Soon after this, Pharaoh-Necho II. (q.v.), king of Egypt, in an expedition against the king of Assyria, with the view of gaining possession of Carchemish, sought a passage through the territory of Judah for his army. This Josiah refused to permit. He had probably entered into some new alliance with the king of Assyria, and faithful to his word he sought to oppose the progress of Necho.</description>
    <description>The army of Judah went out and encountered that of Egypt at Megiddo, on the verge of the plain of Esdraelon. Josiah went into the field in disguise, and was fatally wounded by a random arrow. His attendants conveyed him toward Jerusalem, but had only reached Hadadrimmon, a few miles south of Megiddo, when he died (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 23:28, 30; comp. 2 Chr. 35:20-27</reflink>), after a reign of thirty-one years. He was buried with the greatest honours in fulfilment of Huldah's prophecy (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 22:20; comp. Jer. 34:5</reflink>). Jeremiah composed a funeral elegy on this the best of the kings of Israel (<reflink target="XXX">Lam. 4:20; 2 Chr. 35:25</reflink>). The outburst of national grief on account of his death became proverbial (<reflink target="XXX">Zech. 12:11; comp. Rev. 16:16</reflink>).</description>

    <description>Jehovah is perfect. (1.) The youngest of Gideon's seventy sons. He escaped when the rest were put to death by the order of Abimelech (<reflink target="XXX">Judg. 9:5</reflink>). When "the citizens of Shechem and the whole house of Millo" were gathered together "by the plain of the pillar" (i.e., the stone set up by Joshua, 24:26; comp. Gen. 35:4) "that was in Shechem, to make Abimelech king," from one of the heights of Mount Gerizim he protested against their doing so in the earliest parable, that of the bramble-king. His words then spoken were prophetic. There came a recoil in the feelings of the people toward Abimelech, and then a terrible revenge, in which many were slain and the city of Shechem was destroyed by Abimelech (<reflink target="XXX">Judg. 9:45</reflink>). Having delivered his warning, Jotham fled to Beer from the vengeance of Abimelech (9:7-21).</description>
    <description>(2.) The son and successor of Uzziah on the throne of Judah. As during his last years Uzziah was excluded from public life on account of his leprosy, his son, then twenty-five years of age, administered for seven years the affairs of the kingdom in his father's stead (<reflink target="XXX">2 Chr. 26:21, 23; 27:1</reflink>). After his father's death he became sole monarch, and reigned for sixteen years (B.C. 759-743). He ruled in the fear of God, and his reign was prosperous. He was contemporary with the prophets Isaiah, Hosea, and Micah, by whose ministrations he profited. He was buried in the sepulchre of the kings, greatly lamented by the people (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 15:38; 2 Chr. 27:7-9</reflink>).</description>

  </item>
  <item id="Jubilee">
    <description>a joyful shout or clangour of trumpets, the name of the great semi-centennial festival of the Hebrews. It lasted for a year. During this year the land was to be fallow, and the Israelites were only permitted to gather the spontaneous produce of the fields (<reflink target="XXX">Lev. 25:11, 12</reflink>). All landed property during that year reverted to its original owner (13-34; 27:16-24), and all who were slaves were set free (25:39-54), and all debts were remitted.</description>
    <description>The return of the jubilee year was proclaimed by a blast of trumpets which sounded throughout the land. There is no record in Scripture of the actual observance of this festival, but there are numerous allusions (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 5:7, 8, 9, 10; 61:1, 2; Ezek. 7:12, 13; Neh. 5:1-19; 2 Chr. 36:21</reflink>) which place it beyond a doubt that it was observed.</description>
    <description>The advantages of this institution were manifold. "1. It would prevent the accumulation of land on the part of a few to the detriment of the community at large. 2. It would render it impossible for any one to be born to absolute poverty, since every one had his hereditary land. 3. It would preclude those inequalities which are produced by extremes of riches and poverty, and which make one man domineer over another. 4. It would utterly do away with slavery. 5. It would afford a fresh opportunity to those who were reduced by adverse circumstances to begin again their career of industry in the patrimony which they had temporarily forfeited. 6. It would periodically rectify the disorders which crept into the state in the course of time, preclude the division of the people into nobles and plebeians, and preserve the theocracy inviolate."</description>

    <description>It was Judah that interposed in behalf of Joseph, so that his life was spared (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 37:26, 27</reflink>).

  <item id="Judah upon Jordan">
    <description>The Authorized Version, following the Vulgate, has this rendering in Josh. 19:34. It has been suggested that, following the Masoretic punctuation, the expression should read thus, "and Judah; the Jordan was toward the sun-rising." The sixty cities (Havoth-jair, Num. 32:41) on the east of Jordan were reckoned as belonging to Judah, because Jair, their founder, was a Manassite only on his mother's side, but on his father's side of the tribe of Judah (<reflink target="XXX">1 Chr. 2:5, 21-23</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Judah, Kingdom of">
    <description>When the disruption took place at Shechem, at first only the tribe of Judah followed the house of David. But very soon after the tribe of Benjamin joined the tribe of Judah, and Jerusalem became the capital of the new kingdom (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 18:28</reflink>), which was called the kingdom of Judah. It was very small in extent, being only about the size of the Scottish county of Perth.</description>
    <description>For the first sixty years the kings of Judah aimed at re-establishing their authority over the kingdom of the other ten tribes, so that there was a state of perpetual war between them. For the next eighty years there was no open war between them. For the most part they were in friendly alliance, co-operating against their common enemies, especially against Damascus. For about another century and a half Judah had a somewhat checkered existence after the termination of the kingdom of Israel till its final overthrow in the destruction of the temple (B.C. 588) by Nebuzar-adan, who was captain of Nebuchadnezzar's body-guard (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 25:8-21</reflink>).</description>
    <description>The kingdom maintained a separate existence for three hundred and eighty-nine years. It occupied an area of 3,435 square miles. (<see target="x-self">See ISRAEL, KINGDOM OF.</see>)</description>

  <item id="Judah, Tribe of">
    <description>Judah and his three surviving sons went down with Jacob into Egypt (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 46:12; Ex. 1:2</reflink>). At the time of the Exodus, when we meet with the family of Judah again, they have increased to the number of 74,000 males (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 1:26, 27</reflink>). Its number increased in the wilderness (26:22). Caleb, the son of Jephunneh, represented the tribe as one of the spies (13:6; 34:19). This tribe marched at the van on the east of the tabernacle (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 2:3-9; 10:14</reflink>), its standard, as is supposed, being a lion's whelp. Under Caleb, during the wars of conquest, they conquered that portion of the country which was afterwards assigned to them as their inheritance. This was the only case in which any tribe had its inheritance thus determined (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 14:6-15; 15:13-19</reflink>).</description>
    <description>The inheritance of the tribe of Judah was at first fully one-third of the whole country west of Jordan, in all about 2,300 square miles (Josh. 15). But there was a second distribution, when Simeon received an allotment, about 1,000 square miles, out of the portion of Judah (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 19:9</reflink>). That which remained to Judah was still very large in proportion to the inheritance of the other tribes. The boundaries of the territory are described in Josh. 15:20-63.</description>
    <description>This territory given to Judah was divided into four sections. (1.) The south (Heb. negeb), the undulating pasture-ground between the hills and the desert to the south (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 15:21.</reflink>) This extent of pasture-land became famous as the favourite camping-ground of the old patriarchs. (2.) The "valley" (15:33) or lowland (Heb. shephelah), a broad strip lying between the central highlands and the Mediterranean. This tract was the garden as well as the granary of the tribe. (3.) The "hill-country," or the mountains of Judah, an elevated plateau stretching from below Hebron northward to Jerusalem. "The towns and villages were generally perched on the tops of hills or on rocky slopes. The resources of the soil were great. The country was rich in corn, wine, oil, and fruit; and the daring shepherds were able to lead their flocks far out over the neighbouring plains and through the mountains." The number of towns in this district was thirty-eight (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 15:48-60</reflink>). (4.) The "wilderness," the sunken district next the Dead Sea (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 15:61</reflink>), "averaging 10 miles in breadth, a wild, barren, uninhabitable region, fit only to afford scanty pasturage for sheep and goats, and a secure home for leopards, bears, wild goats, and outlaws" (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 17:34; 22:1; Mark 1:13</reflink>). It was divided into the "wilderness of En-gedi" (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 24:1</reflink>), the "wilderness of Judah" (<reflink target="XXX">Judg. 1:16; Matt. 3:1</reflink>), between the Hebron mountain range and the Dead Sea, the "wilderness of Maon" (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 23:24</reflink>). It contained only six cities.</description>
    <description>Nine of the cities of Judah were assigned to the priests (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 21:9-19</reflink>).</description>

  <item id="Judas">
    <description>the Graecized form of Judah. (1.) The patriarch (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 1:2, 3</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(2.) Son of Simon (<reflink target="XXX">John 6:71; 13:2, 26</reflink>), surnamed Iscariot, i.e., a man of Kerioth (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 15:25</reflink>). His name is uniformly the last in the list of the apostles, as given in the synoptic (i.e., the first three) Gospels. The evil of his nature probably gradually unfolded itself till "Satan entered into him" (<reflink target="XXX">John 13:27</reflink>), and he betrayed our Lord (18:3). Afterwards he owned his sin with "an exceeding bitter cry," and cast the money he had received as the wages of his iniquity down on the floor of the sanctuary, and "departed and went and hanged himself" (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 27:5</reflink>). He perished in his guilt, and "went unto his own place" (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 1:25</reflink>). The statement in Acts 1:18 that he "fell headlong and burst asunder in the midst, and all his bowels gushed out," is in no way contrary to that in Matt. 27:5. The sucide first hanged himself, perhaps over the valley of Hinnom, "and the rope giving way, or the branch to which he hung breaking, he fell down headlong on his face, and was crushed and mangled on the rocky pavement below."</description>
    <description>Why such a man was chosen to be an apostle we know not, but it is written that "Jesus knew from the beginning who should betray him" (<reflink target="XXX">John 6:64</reflink>). Nor can any answer be satisfactorily given to the question as to the motives that led Judas to betray his Master. "Of the motives that have been assigned we need not care to fix on any one as that which simply led him on. Crime is, for the most part, the result of a hundred motives rushing with bewildering fury through the mind of the criminal."</description>
    <description>(3.) A Jew of Damascus (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 9:11</reflink>), to whose house Ananias was sent. The street called "Straight" in which it was situated is identified with the modern "street of bazaars," where is still pointed out the so-called "house of Judas."</description>
    <description>(4.) A Christian teacher, surnamed Barsabas. He was sent from Jerusalem to Antioch along with Paul and Barnabas with the decision of the council (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 15:22, 27, 32</reflink>). He was a "prophet" and a "chief man among the brethren."</description>

  <item id="Jude">
    <description>= Judas. Among the apostles there were two who bore this name, (1) Judas (<reflink target="XXX">Jude 1:1; Matt. 13:55; John 14:22; Acts 1:13</reflink>), called also Lebbaeus or Thaddaeus (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 10:3; Mark 3:18</reflink>); and (2) Judas Iscariot (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 10:4; Mark 3:19</reflink>). He who is called "the brother of James" (<reflink target="XXX">Luke 6:16</reflink>), may be the same with the Judas surnamed Lebbaeus. The only thing recorded regarding him is in John 14:22.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Jude, Epistle of">
    <description>The author was "Judas, the brother of James" the Less (<reflink target="XXX">Jude 1:1</reflink>), called also Lebbaeus (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 10:3</reflink>) and Thaddaeus (<reflink target="XXX">Mark 3:18</reflink>). The genuineness of this epistle was early questioned, and doubts regarding it were revived at the time of the Reformation; but the evidences in support of its claims are complete. It has all the marks of having proceeded from the writer whose name it bears.</description>
    <description>There is nothing very definite to determine the time and place at which it was written. It was apparently written in the later period of the apostolic age, for when it was written there were persons still alive who had heard the apostles preach (ver. 17). It may thus have been written about A.D. 66 or 70, and apparently in Palestine.</description>
    <description>The epistle is addressed to Christians in general (ver. 1), and its design is to put them on their guard against the misleading efforts of a certain class of errorists to which they were exposed. The style of the epistle is that of an "impassioned invective, in the impetuous whirlwind of which the writer is hurried along, collecting example after example of divine vengeance on the ungodly; heaping epithet upon epithet, and piling image upon image, and, as it were, labouring for words and images strong enough to depict the polluted character of the licentious apostates against whom he is warning the Church; returning again and again to the subject, as though all language was insufficient to give an adequate idea of their profligacy, and to express his burning hatred of their perversion of the doctrines of the gospel."</description>
    <description>The striking resemblance this epistle bears to 2 Peter suggests the idea that the author of the one had seen the epistle of the other.</description>
    <description>The doxology with which the epistle concludes is regarded as the finest in the New Testament.</description>

  <item id="Judea">
    <description>After the Captivity this name was applied to the whole of the country west of the Jordan (<reflink target="XXX">Hag. 1:1, 14; 2:2</reflink>). But under the Romans, in the time of Christ, it denoted the southernmost of the three divisions of Palestine (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 2:1, 5; 3:1; 4:25</reflink>), although it was also sometimes used for Palestine generally (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 28:21</reflink>).</description>
    <description>The province of Judea, as distinguished from Galilee and Samaria, included the territories of the tribes of Judah, Benjamin, Dan, Simeon, and part of Ephraim. Under the Romans it was a part of the province of Syria, and was governed by a procurator.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Judge">
    <description>(Heb. shophet, pl. shophetim), properly a magistrate or ruler, rather than one who judges in the sense of trying a cause. This is the name given to those rulers who presided over the affairs of the Israelites during the interval between the death of Joshua and the accession of Saul (<reflink target="XXX">Judg. 2:18</reflink>), a period of general anarchy and confusion. "The office of judges or regents was held during life, but it was not hereditary, neither could they appoint their successors. Their authority was limited by the law alone, and in doubtful cases they were directed to consult the divine King through the priest by Urim and Thummim (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 27:21</reflink>). Their authority extended only over those tribes by whom they had been elected or acknowledged. There was no income attached to their office, and they bore no external marks of dignity. The only cases of direct divine appointment are those of Gideon and Samson, and the latter stood in the peculiar position of having been from before his birth ordained 'to begin to deliver Israel.' Deborah was called to deliver Israel, but was already a judge. Samuel was called by the Lord to be a prophet but not a judge, which ensued from the high gifts the people recognized as dwelling in him; and as to Eli, the office of judge seems to have devolved naturally or rather ex officio upon him." Of five of the judges, Tola (<reflink target="XXX">Judg. 10:1</reflink>), Jair (3), Ibzan, Elon, and Abdon (12:8-15), we have no record at all beyond the bare fact that they were judges. Sacred history is not the history of individuals but of the kingdom of God in its onward progress.</description>
    <description>In Ex. 2:14 Moses is so styled. This fact may indicate that while for revenue purposes the "taskmasters" were over the people, they were yet, just as at a later time when under the Romans, governed by their own rulers.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Judges, Book of">
    <description>is so called because it contains the history of the deliverance and government of Israel by the men who bore the title of the "judges." The book of Ruth originally formed part of this book, but about A.D. 450 it was separated from it and placed in the Hebrew scriptures immediately after the Song of Solomon.</description>
    <description>The book contains, (1.) An introduction (1-3:6), connecting it with the previous narrative in Joshua, as a "link in the chain of books." (2.) The history of the thirteen judges (3:7-16:31) in the following order:</description>
    <description>FIRST PERIOD (3:7-ch. 5)                                              Years  I. Servitude under Chushan-rishathaim of     Mesopotamia                                8    1.

    <description>Samson's exploits probably synchronize with the period immediately preceding the national repentance and reformation under Samuel (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 7:2-6</reflink>).</description>
    <description>After Samson came Eli, who was both high priest and judge. He directed the civil and religious affairs of the people for forty years, at the close of which the Philistines again invaded the land and oppressed it for twenty years. Samuel was raised up to deliver the people from this oppression, and he judged Israel for some twelve years, when the direction of affairs fell into the hands of Saul, who was anointed king. If Eli and Samuel are included, there were then fifteen judges. But the chronology of this whole period is uncertain.</description>
    <description>(3.) The historic section of the book is followed by an appendix (17-21), which has no formal connection with that which goes before. It records (a) the conquest (17, 18) of Laish by a portion of the tribe of Dan; and (b) the almost total extinction of the tribe of Benjamin by the other tribes, in consequence of their assisting the men of Gibeah (19-21). This section properly belongs to the period only a few years after the death of Joshua. It shows the religious and moral degeneracy of the people.</description>
    <description>The author of this book was most probably Samuel. The internal evidence both of the first sixteen chapters and of the appendix warrants this conclusion. It was probably composed during Saul's reign, or at the very beginning of David's. The words in 18:30,31, imply that it was written after the taking of the ark by the Philistines, and after it was set up at Nob (1 Sam. 21). In David's reign the ark was at Gibeon (<reflink target="XXX">1 Chr. 16:39</reflink>)</description>

  <item id="Judgment hall">
    <description>Gr. praitorion (<reflink target="XXX">John 18:28, 33; 19:9; Matt. 27:27</reflink>), "common hall." In all these passages the Revised Version renders "palace." In Mark 15:16 the word is rendered "Praetorium" (q.v.), which is a Latin word, meaning literally the residence of the praetor, and then the governor's residence in general, though not a praetor. Throughout the Gospels the word "praitorion" has this meaning (<reflink target="XXX">comp. Acts 23:35</reflink>). Pilate's official residence when he was in Jerusalem was probably a part of the fortress of Antonia.</description>
    <description>The trial of our Lord was carried on in a room or office of the palace. The "whole band" spoken of by Mark were gathered together in the palace court.</description>

  <item id="Judgment seat">
    <description>(<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 27:19</reflink>), a portable tribunal (Gr. bema) which was placed according as the magistrate might direct, and from which judgment was pronounced. In this case it was placed on a tesselated pavement, probably in front of the procurator's residence. (<see target="x-self">See GABBATHA.</see>)</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Judgment, The final">
    <description>the sentence that will be passed on our actions at the last day (Matt. 25; Rom. 14:10, 11; 2 Cor. 5:10; 2 Thess. 1:7-10).</description>
    <description>The judge is Jesus Christ, as mediator. All judgment is committed to him (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 17:31; John 5:22, 27; Rev. 1:7</reflink>). "It pertains to him as mediator to complete and publicly manifest the salvation of his people and the overthrow of his enemies, together with the glorious righteousness of his work in both respects."</description>
    <description>The persons to be judged are, (1) the whole race of Adam without a single exception (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 25:31-46; 1 Cor. 15:51, 52; Rev. 20:11-15</reflink>); and (2) the fallen angels (<reflink target="XXX">2 Pet. 2:4; Jude 1:6</reflink>).</description>
    <description>The rule of judgment is the standard of God's law as revealed to men, the heathen by the law as written on their hearts (<reflink target="XXX">Luke 12:47,48; Rom. 2:12-16</reflink>); the Jew who "sinned in the law shall be judged by the law" (<reflink target="XXX">Rom. 2:12</reflink>); the Christian enjoying the light of revelation, by the will of God as made known to him (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 11:20-24; John 3:19</reflink>). Then the secrets of all hearts will be brought to light (<reflink target="XXX">1 Cor. 4:5; Luke 8:17; 12:2,3</reflink>) to vindicate the justice of the sentence pronounced.</description>
    <description>The time of the judgment will be after the resurrection (<reflink target="XXX">Heb. 9:27; Acts 17:31</reflink>).</description>
    <description>As the Scriptures represent the final judgment "as certain [Eccl. 11:9], universal [2 Cor. 5:10], righteous [Rom. 2:5], decisive [1 Cor. 15:52], and eternal as to its consequences [Heb. 6:2], let us be concerned for the welfare of our immortal interests, flee to the refuge set before us, improve our precious time, depend on the merits of the Redeemer, and adhere to the dictates of the divine word, that we may be found of him in peace."</description>

    <description>(Heb. rothem), called by the Arabs retem, and known as Spanish broom; ranked under the genus genista. It is a desert shrub, and abounds in many parts of Palestine. In the account of his journey from Akabah to Jerusalem, Dr. Robinson says: "This is the largest and most conspicuous shrub of these deserts, growing thickly in the water-courses and valleys. Our Arabs always selected the place of encampment, if possible, in a spot where it grew, in order to be sheltered by it at night from the wind; and during the day, when they often went on in advance of the camels, we found them not unfrequently sitting or sleeping under a bush of retem to shelter them from the sun. It was in this very desert, a day's journey from Beersheba, that the prophet Elijah lay down and slept beneath the same shrub" (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 19:4, 5</reflink>). It afforded material for fuel, and also in cases of extremity for human food (<reflink target="XXX">Ps. 120:4; Job 30:4</reflink>).

  <item id="Justice">
    <description>is rendering to every one that which is his due. It has been distinguished from equity in this respect, that while justice means merely the doing what positive law demands, equity means the doing of what is fair and right in every separate case.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Justice of God">
    <description>that perfection of his nature whereby he is infinitely righteous in himself and in all he does, the righteousness of the divine nature exercised in his moral government. At first God imposes righteous laws on his creatures and executes them righteously. Justice is not an optional product of his will, but an unchangeable principle of his very nature. His legislative justice is his requiring of his rational creatures conformity in all respects to the moral law. His rectoral or distributive justice is his dealing with his accountable creatures according to the requirements of the law in rewarding or punishing them (<reflink target="XXX">Ps. 89:14</reflink>). In remunerative justice he distributes rewards (<reflink target="XXX">James 1:12; 2 Tim. 4:8</reflink>); in vindictive or punitive justice he inflicts punishment on account of transgression (<reflink target="XXX">2 Thess. 1:6</reflink>). He cannot, as being infinitely righteous, do otherwise than regard and hate sin as intrinsically hateful and deserving of punishment. "He cannot deny himself" (<reflink target="XXX">2 Tim. 2:13</reflink>). His essential and eternal righteousness immutably determines him to visit every sin as such with merited punishment.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Justification">
    <description>a forensic term, opposed to condemnation. As regards its nature, it is the judicial act of God, by which he pardons all the sins of those who believe in Christ, and accounts, accepts, and treats them as righteous in the eye of the law, i.e., as conformed to all its demands. In addition to the pardon (q.v.) of sin, justification declares that all the claims of the law are satisfied in respect of the justified. It is the act of a judge and not of a sovereign. The law is not relaxed or set aside, but is declared to be fulfilled in the strictest sense; and so the person justified is declared to be entitled to all the advantages and rewards arising from perfect obedience to the law (<reflink target="XXX">Rom. 5:1-10</reflink>).</description>
    <description>It proceeds on the imputing or crediting to the believer by God himself of the perfect righteousness, active and passive, of his Representative and Surety, Jesus Christ (<reflink target="XXX">Rom. 10:3-9</reflink>). Justification is not the forgiveness of a man without righteousness, but a declaration that he possesses a righteousness which perfectly and for ever satisfies the law, namely, Christ's righteousness (<reflink target="XXX">2 Cor. 5:21; Rom. 4:6-8</reflink>).</description>
    <description>The sole condition on which this righteousness is imputed or credited to the believer is faith in or on the Lord Jesus Christ. Faith is called a "condition," not because it possesses any merit, but only because it is the instrument, the only instrument by which the soul appropriates or apprehends Christ and his righteousness (<reflink target="XXX">Rom. 1:17; 3:25, 26; 4:20, 22; Phil. 3:8-11; Gal. 2:16</reflink>).</description>
    <description>The act of faith which thus secures our justification secures also at the same time our sanctification (q.v.); and thus the doctrine of justification by faith does not lead to licentiousness (<reflink target="XXX">Rom. 6:2-7</reflink>). Good works, while not the ground, are the certain consequence of justification (6:14; 7:6). (<see target="x-self">See GALATIANS, EPISTLE TO.</see>)</description>

  <item id="Kadesh (1)">
    <description>holy, or Kadesh-Barnea, sacred desert of wandering, a place on the south-eastern border of Palestine, about 165 miles from Horeb. It lay in the "wilderness" or "desert of Zin" (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 14:7; Num. 13:3-26; 14:29-33; 20:1; 27:14</reflink>), on the border of Edom (20:16). From this place, in compliance with the desire of the people, Moses sent forth "twelve spies" to spy the land. After examining it in all its districts, the spies brought back an evil report, Joshua and Caleb alone giving a good report of the land (13:18-31). Influenced by the discouraging report, the people abandoned all hope of entering into the Promised Land. They remained a considerable time at Kadesh. (<see target="x-self">See HORMAH ; KORAH.</see>) Because of their unbelief, they were condemned by God to wander for thirty-eight years in the wilderness. They took their journey from Kadesh into the deserts of Paran, "by way of the Red Sea" (<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 2:1</reflink>). (One theory is that during these thirty-eight years they remained in and about Kadesh.)</description>
    <description>At the end of these years of wanderings, the tribes were a second time gathered together at Kadesh. During their stay here at this time Miriam died and was buried. Here the people murmured for want of water, as their forefathers had done formerly at Rephidim; and Moses, irritated by their chidings, "with his rod smote the rock twice," instead of "speaking to the rock before their eyes," as the Lord had commanded him (<reflink target="XXX">comp. Num. 27:14; Deut. 9:23; Ps. 106:32, 33</reflink>). Because of this act of his, in which Aaron too was involved, neither of them was to be permitted to set foot within the Promised Land (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 20:12, 24</reflink>). The king of Edom would not permit them to pass on through his territory, and therefore they commenced an eastward march, and "came unto Mount Hor" (20:22).</description>
    <description>This place has been identified with 'Ain el-Kadeis, about 12 miles east-south-east of Beersheba. (<see target="x-self">See SPIES.</see>)</description>

  <item id="Kadesh (2)">
    <description>the sacred city of the Hittites, on the left bank of the Orontes, about 4 miles south of the Lake of Homs. It is identified with the great mound Tell Neby Mendeh, some 50 to 100 feet high, and 400 yards long. On the ruins of the temple of Karnak, in Egypt, has been found an inscription recording the capture of this city by Rameses II. (<see target="x-self">See PHARAOH.</see>) Here the sculptor "has chiselled in deep work on the stone, with a bold execution of the several parts, the procession of the warriors, the battle before Kadesh, the storming of the fortress, the overthrow of the enemy, and the camp life of the Egyptians."

    <description>reedy; brook of reeds. (1.) A stream forming the boundary between Ephraim and Manasseh, from the Mediterranean eastward to Tappuah (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 16:8</reflink>). It has been identified with the sedgy streams that constitute the Wady Talaik, which enters the sea between Joppa and Caesarea. Others identify it with the river' Aujeh.</description>
    <description>(2.) A town in the north of Asher (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 19:28</reflink>). It has been identified with 'Ain-Kana, a village on the brow of a valley some 7 miles south-east of Tyre. About a mile north of this place are many colossal ruins strown about. And in the side of a neighbouring ravine are figures of men, women, and children cut in the face of the rock. These are supposed to be of Phoenician origin.</description>

They lived in black hair-tents (<reflink target="XXX">Cant. 1:5</reflink>). To "dwell in the tents of Kedar" was to be cut off from the worship of the true God (<reflink target="XXX">Ps. 120:5</reflink>).

    <description>(3.) A "fenced city" of Naphtali, one of the cities of refuge (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 19:37; Judg. 4:6</reflink>). It was assigned to the Gershonite Levites (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 21:32</reflink>). It was originally a Canaanite royal city (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 12:22</reflink>), and was the residence of Barak (<reflink target="XXX">Judg. 4:6</reflink>); and here he and Deborah assembled the tribes of Zebulun and Naphtali before the commencement of the conflict with Sisera in the plain of Esdraelon, "for Jehovah among the mighty" (9, 10). In the reign of Pekah it was taken by Tiglath-Pileser (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 15:29</reflink>). It was situated near the "plain" (rather "the oak") of Zaanaim, and has been identified with the modern Kedes, on the hills fully four miles north-west of Lake El Huleh.</description>
    <description>It has been supposed by some that the Kedesh of the narrative, where Barak assembled his troops, was not the place in Upper Galilee so named, which was 30 miles distant from the plain of Esdraelon, but Kedish, on the shore of the Sea of Galilee, 12 miles from Tabor.</description>

  <item id="Kedron">
    <description>the valley, now quite narrow, between the Mount of Olives and Mount Moriah. The upper part of it is called the Valley of Jehoshaphat. The LXX., in 1 Kings 15:13, translate "of the cedar." The word means "black," and may refer to the colour of the water or the gloom of the ravine, or the black green of the cedars which grew there.

David rescued it from the attack of the Philistines (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 23:1-8</reflink>); but the inhabitants proving unfaithful to him, in that they sought to deliver him up to Saul (13), he and his men "departed from Keilah, and went whithersoever they could go." They fled to the hill Hareth, about 3 miles to the east, and thence through Hebron to Ziph (q.v.). "And David was in the wilderness of Ziph, in a wood" (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 23:15</reflink>). Here Jonathan sought him out, "and strengthened his hand in God." This was the last interview between David and Jonathan (23:16-18). It is the modern Khurbet Kila.

Caleb's younger brother, and father of Othniel (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 15:17</reflink>), whose family was of importance in Israel down to the time of David (<reflink target="XXX">1 Chr. 27:15</reflink>).

  </item>
  <item id="Kenites">
    <description>smiths, the name of a tribe inhabiting the desert lying between southern Palestine and the mountains of Sinai. Jethro was of this tribe (<reflink target="XXX">Judg. 1:16</reflink>). He is called a "Midianite" (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 10:29</reflink>), and hence it is concluded that the Midianites and the Kenites were the same tribe. They were wandering smiths, "the gipsies and travelling tinkers of the old Oriental world. They formed an important guild in an age when the art of metallurgy was confined to a few" (Sayce's Races, etc.). They showed kindness to Israel in their journey through the wilderness. They accompanied them in their march as far as Jericho (<reflink target="XXX">Judg. 1:16</reflink>), and then returned to their old haunts among the Amalekites, in the desert to the south of Judah. They sustained afterwards friendly relations with the Israelites when settled in Canaan (<reflink target="XXX">Judg. 4:11, 17-21; 1 Sam. 27:10; 30:29</reflink>). The Rechabites belonged to this tribe (<reflink target="XXX">1 Chr. 2:55</reflink>) and in the days of Jeremiah (35:7-10) are referred to as following their nomad habits. Saul bade them depart from the Amalekites (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 15:6</reflink>) when, in obedience to the divine commission, he was about to "smite Amalek." And his reason is, "for ye showed kindness to all the children of Israel when they came up out of Egypt." Thus "God is not unrighteous to forget the kindnesses shown to his people; but they shall be remembered another day, at the farthest in the great day, and recompensed in the resurrection of the just" (M. Henry's Commentary). They are mentioned for the last time in Scripture in 1 Sam. 27:10; comp. 30:20.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Kenizzite">
    <description>(1.) The name of a tribe referred to in the covenant God made with Abraham (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 15:19</reflink>). They are not mentioned among the original inhabitants of Canaan (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 3:8; Josh. 3:10</reflink>), and probably they inhabited some part of Arabia, in the confines of Syria.</description>
    <description>(2.) A designation given to Caleb (R.V., Num. 32:12; A.V., Kenezite).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Kerchief">
    <description>mentioned only Ezek. 13:18, 21, as an article of apparel or ornament applied to the head of the idolatrous women of Israel. The precise meaning of the word is uncertain. It appears to have been a long loose shawl, such as Oriental women wrap themselves in (<reflink target="XXX">Ruth 3:15; Isa. 3:22</reflink>). Some think that it was a long veil or head-dress, denoting by its form the position of those who wore it.</description>

Through the offshoots of the Keturah line Abraham became the "father of many nations."</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Key">
    <description>frequently mentioned in Scripture. It is called in Hebrew _maphteah_, i.e., the opener (<reflink target="XXX">Judg. 3:25</reflink>); and in the Greek New Testament _kleis_, from its use in shutting (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 16:19; Luke 11:52; Rev. 1:18, etc.</reflink>). Figures of ancient Egyptian keys are frequently found on the monuments, also of Assyrian locks and keys of wood, and of a large size (<reflink target="XXX">comp. Isa. 22:22</reflink>).</description>
    <description>The word is used figuratively of power or authority or office (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 22:22; Rev. 3:7; Rev. 1:8; comp. 9:1; 20:1; comp. also Matt. 16:19; 18:18</reflink>). The "key of knowledge" (<reflink target="XXX">Luke 11:52; comp. Matt. 23:13</reflink>) is the means of attaining the knowledge regarding the kingdom of God. The "power of the keys" is a phrase in general use to denote the extent of ecclesiastical authority.</description>

  <item id="Kibroth-hattaavah">
    <description>the graves of the longing or of lust, one of the stations of the Israelites in the wilderness. It was probably in the Wady Murrah, and has been identified with the Erweis el-Ebeirig, where the remains of an ancient encampment have been found, about 30 miles north-east of Sinai, and exactly a day's journey from 'Ain Hudherah.</description>
    <description>"Here began the troubles of the journey. First, complaints broke out among the people, probably at the heat, the toil, and the privations of the march; and then God at once punished them by lightning, which fell on the hinder part of the camp, and killed many persons, but ceased at the intercession of Moses (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 11:1, 2</reflink>). Then a disgust fell on the multitude at having nothing to eat but the manna day after day, no change, no flesh, no fish, no high-flavoured vegetables, no luscious fruits...The people loathed the 'light food,' and cried out to Moses, 'Give us flesh, give us flesh, that we may eat.'" In this emergency Moses, in despair, cried unto God. An answer came. God sent "a prodigious flight of quails, on which the people satiated their gluttonous appetite for a full month. Then punishment fell on them: they loathed the food which they had desired; it bred disease in them; the divine anger aggravated the disease into a plague, and a heavy mortality was the consequence. The dead were buried without the camp; and in memory of man's sin and of the divine wrath this name, Kibroth-hattaavah, the Graves of Lust, was given to the place of their sepulchre" (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 11:34, 35; 33:16, 17; Deut. 9:22; comp. Ps. 78:30, 31</reflink>)., Rawlinson's Moses, p. 175. From this encampment they journeyed in a north-eastern direction to Hazeroth.</description>

  <item id="Kid">
    <description>the young of the goat. It was much used for food (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 27:9; 38:17; Judg. 6:19; 14:6</reflink>). The Mosaic law forbade to dress a kid in the milk of its dam, a law which is thrice repeated (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 23:19; 34:26; Deut. 14:21</reflink>). Among the various reasons assigned for this law, that appears to be the most satisfactory which regards it as "a protest against cruelty and outraging the order of nature." A kid cooked in its mother's milk is "a gross, unwholesome dish, and calculated to kindle animal and ferocious passions, and on this account Moses may have forbidden it. Besides, it is even yet associated with immoderate feasting; and originally, I suspect," says Dr. Thomson (Land and the Book), "was connected with idolatrous sacrifices."</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Kidron">
    <description>= Kedron = Cedron, turbid, the winter torrent which flows through the Valley of Jehoshaphat, on the eastern side of Jerusalem, between the city and the Mount of Olives. This valley is known in Scripture only by the name "the brook Kidron." David crossed this brook bare-foot and weeping, when fleeing from Absalom (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 15:23, 30</reflink>), and it was frequently crossed by our Lord in his journeyings to and fro (<reflink target="XXX">John 18:1</reflink>). Here Asa burned the obscene idols of his mother (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 15:13</reflink>), and here Athaliah was executed (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 11:16</reflink>). It afterwards became the receptacle for all manner of impurities (<reflink target="XXX">2 Chr. 29:16; 30:14</reflink>); and in the time of Josiah this valley was the common cemetery of the city (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 23:6; comp. Jer. 26:23</reflink>).</description>
    <description>Through this mountain ravine no water runs, except after heavy rains in the mountains round about Jerusalem. Its length from its head to en-Rogel is 2 3/4 miles. Its precipitous, rocky banks are filled with ancient tombs, especially the left bank opposite the temple area. The greatest desire of the Jews is to be buried there, from the idea that the Kidron is the "valley of Jehoshaphat" mentioned in Joel 3:2.</description>
    <description>Below en-Rogel the Kidron has no historical or sacred interest. It runs in a winding course through the wilderness of Judea to the north-western shore of the Dead Sea. Its whole length, in a straight line, is only some 20 miles, but in this space its descent is about 3,912 feet. (<see target="x-self">See KEDRON.</see>)</description>
    <description>Recent excavations have brought to light the fact that the old bed of the Kidron is about 40 feet lower than its present bed, and about 70 feet nearer the sanctuary wall.</description>

  <item id="Kinah">
    <description>an elegy, a city in the extreme south of Judah (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 15:22</reflink>). It was probably not far from the Dead Sea, in the Wady Fikreh.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Kine">
    <description>(Heb. sing. parah, i.e., "fruitful"), mentioned in Pharaoh's dream (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 41: 18</reflink>). Here the word denotes "buffaloes," which fed on the reeds and sedge by the river's brink.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="King">
    <description>is in Scripture very generally used to denote one invested with authority, whether extensive or limited. There were thirty-one kings in Canaan (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 12:9, 24</reflink>), whom Joshua subdued. Adonibezek subdued seventy kings (<reflink target="XXX">Judg. 1:7</reflink>). In the New Testament the Roman emperor is spoken of as a king (<reflink target="XXX">1 Pet. 2:13, 17</reflink>); and Herod Antipas, who was only a tetrarch, is also called a king (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 14:9; Mark 6:22</reflink>).</description>
    <description>This title is applied to God (<reflink target="XXX">1 Tim. 1:17</reflink>), and to Christ, the Son of God (<reflink target="XXX">1 Tim. 6:15, 16; Matt. 27:11</reflink>). The people of God are also called "kings" (<reflink target="XXX">Dan. 7:22, 27; Matt. 19:28; Rev. 1:6, etc.</reflink>). Death is called the "king of terrors" (<reflink target="XXX">Job 18:14</reflink>).</description>
    <description>Jehovah was the sole King of the Jewish nation (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 8:7; Isa. 33:22</reflink>). But there came a time in the history of that people when a king was demanded, that they might be like other nations (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 8:5</reflink>). The prophet Samuel remonstrated with them, but the people cried out, "Nay, but we will have a king over us." The misconduct of Samuel's sons was the immediate cause of this demand.</description>
    <description>The Hebrew kings did not rule in their own right, nor in name of the people who had chosen them, but partly as servants and partly as representatives of Jehovah, the true King of Israel (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 10:1</reflink>). The limits of the king's power were prescribed (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 10:25</reflink>). The officers of his court were, (1) the recorder or remembrancer (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 8:16; 1 Kings 4:3</reflink>); (2) the scribe (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 8:17; 20:25</reflink>); (3) the officer over the house, the chief steward (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 22:15</reflink>); (4) the "king's friend," a confidential companion (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 4:5</reflink>); (5) the keeper of the wardrobe (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 22:14</reflink>); (6) captain of the bodyguard (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 20:23</reflink>); (7) officers over the king's treasures, etc. (<reflink target="XXX">1 Chr. 27:25-31</reflink>); (8) commander-in-chief of the army (<reflink target="XXX">1 Chr. 27:34</reflink>); (9) the royal counsellor (<reflink target="XXX">1 Chr. 27:32; 2 Sam. 16:20-23</reflink>).</description>

    <description>(<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 6:33; Mark 1:14, 15; Luke 4:43</reflink>) = "kingdom of Christ" (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 13:41; 20:21</reflink>) = "kingdom of Christ and of God" (<reflink target="XXX">Eph. 5:5</reflink>) = "kingdom of David" (<reflink target="XXX">Mark 11:10</reflink>) = "the kingdom" (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 8:12; 13:19</reflink>) = "kingdom of heaven" (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 3:2; 4:17; 13:41</reflink>), all denote the same thing under different aspects, viz.: (1) Christ's mediatorial authority, or his rule on the earth; (2) the blessings and advantages of all kinds that flow from this rule; (3) the subjects of this kingdom taken collectively, or the Church.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Kingly office of Christ">
    <description>one of the three special relations in which Christ stands to his people. Christ's office as mediator comprehends three different functions, viz., those of a prophet, priest, and king. These are not three distinct offices, but three functions of the one office of mediator.</description>
    <description>Christ is King and sovereign Head over his Church and over all things to his Church (<reflink target="XXX">Eph. 1:22; 4:15; Col. 1:18; 2:19</reflink>). He executes this mediatorial kingship in his Church, and over his Church, and over all things in behalf of his Church. This royalty differs from that which essentially belongs to him as God, for it is given to him by the Father as the reward of his obedience and sufferings (<reflink target="XXX">Phil. 2:6-11</reflink>), and has as its especial object the upbuilding and the glory of his redeemed Church. It attaches, moreover, not to his divine nature as such, but to his person as God-man.</description>
    <description>Christ's mediatorial kingdom may be regarded as comprehending, (1) his kingdom of power, or his providential government of the universe; (2) his kingdom of grace, which is wholly spiritual in its subjects and administration; and (3) his kingdom of glory, which is the consummation of all his providential and gracious administration.</description>
    <description>Christ sustained and exercised the function of mediatorial King as well as of Prophet and Priest, from the time of the fall of man, when he entered on his mediatorial work; yet it may be said that he was publicly and formally enthroned when he ascended up on high and sat down at the Father's right hand (<reflink target="XXX">Ps. 2:6; Jer. 23:5; Isa. 9:6</reflink>), after his work of humiliation and suffering on earth was "finished."</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Kings, The Books of">
    <description>The two books of Kings formed originally but one book in the Hebrew Scriptures. The present division into two books was first made by the LXX., which now, with the Vulgate, numbers them as the third and fourth books of Kings, the two books of Samuel being the first and second books of Kings.</description>
    <description>They contain the annals of the Jewish commonwealth from the accession of Solomon till the subjugation of the kingdom by Nebuchadnezzar and the Babylonians (apparently a period of about four hundred and fifty-three years). The books of Chronicles (q.v.) are more comprehensive in their contents than those of Kings. The latter synchronize with 1 Chr. 28-2 Chr. 36:21. While in the Chronicles greater prominence is given to the priestly or Levitical office, in the Kings greater prominence is given to the kingly.</description>
    <description>The authorship of these books is uncertain. There are some portions of them and of Jeremiah that are almost identical, e.g., 2 Kings 24:18-25 and Jer. 52; 39:1-10; 40:7-41:10. There are also many undesigned coincidences between Jeremiah and Kings (2 Kings 21-23 and Jer. 7:15; 15:4; 19:3, etc.), and events recorded in Kings of which Jeremiah had personal knowledge. These facts countenance in some degree the tradition that Jeremiah was the author of the books of Kings. But the more probable supposition is that Ezra, after the Captivity, compiled them from documents written perhaps by David, Solomon, Nathan, Gad, and Iddo, and that he arranged them in the order in which they now exist.</description>
    <description>In the threefold division of the Scriptures by the Jews, these books are ranked among the "Prophets." They are frequently quoted or alluded to by our Lord and his apostles (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 6:29; 12:42; Luke 4:25, 26; 10:4; comp. 2 Kings 4:29; Mark 1:6; comp. 2 Kings 1:8; Matt. 3:4, etc.</reflink>).</description>
    <description>The sources of the narrative are referred to (1) "the book of the acts of Solomon" (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 11:41</reflink>); (2) the "book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah" (14:29; 15:7, 23, etc.); (3) the "book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel" (14:19; 15:31; 16:14, 20, 27, etc.).</description>
    <description>The date of its composition was some time between B.C. 561, the date of the last chapter (2 Kings 25), when Jehoiachin was released from captivity by Evil-merodach, and B.C. 538, the date of the decree of deliverance by Cyrus.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Kinsman">
    <description>Heb. goel, from root meaning to redeem. The goel among the Hebrews was the nearest male blood relation alive. Certain important obligations devolved upon him toward his next of kin. (1.) If any one from poverty was unable to redeem his inheritance, it was the duty of the kinsman to redeem it (<reflink target="XXX">Lev. 25:25,28; Ruth 3:9, 12</reflink>). He was also required to redeem his relation who had sold himself into slavery (<reflink target="XXX">Lev. 25:48, 49</reflink>).</description>
    <description>God is the Goel of his people because he redeems them (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 6:6; Isa. 43:1; 41:14; 44:6, 22; 48:20; Ps. 103:4; Job 19:25, etc.</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(2.) The goel also was the avenger (q.v.) of blood (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 35:21</reflink>) in the case of the murder of the next of kin.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Kir">
    <description>a wall or fortress, a place to which Tiglath-pileser carried the Syrians captive after he had taken the city of Damascus (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 16:9; Amos 1:5; 9:7</reflink>). Isaiah (22:6), who also was contemporary with these events, mentions it along with Elam. Some have supposed that Kir is a variant of Cush (Susiana), on the south of Elam.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Kir of Moab">
    <description>Isa. 15:1. The two strongholds of Moab were Ar and Kir, which latter is probably the Kir-haraseth (16:7) following.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Kir-haraseth">
    <description>built fortress, a city and fortress of Moab, the modern Kerak, a small town on the brow of a steep hill about 6 miles from Rabbath-Moab and 10 miles from the Dead Sea; called also Kir-haresh, Kir-hareseth, Kir-heres (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 16:7, 11; Jer. 48:31, 36</reflink>). After the death of Ahab, Mesha, king of Moab (<see target="x-self">see MOABITE STONE</see>), threw off allegiance to the king of Israel, and fought successfully for the independence of his kingdom. After this Jehoram, king of Israel, in seeking to regain his supremacy over Moab, entered into an alliance with Jehoshaphat, king of Judah, and with the king of Edom. The three kings led their armies against Mesha, who was driven back to seek refuge in Kir-haraseth. The Moabites were driven to despair. Mesha then took his eldest son, who would have reigned in his stead, and offered him as a burnt-offering on the wall of the fortress in the sight of the allied armies. "There was great indignation against Israel: and they departed from him, and returned to their own land." The invaders evacuated the land of Moab, and Mesha achieved the independence of his country (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 3:20-27</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Kirjath">
    <description>city, a city belonging to Benjamin (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 18:28</reflink>), the modern Kuriet el-'Enab, i.e., "city of grapes", about 7 1/2 miles west-north-west of Jerusalem.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Kirjath-arba">
    <description>city of Arba, the original name of Hebron (q.v.), so called from the name of its founder, one of the Anakim (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 23:2; 35:27; Josh. 15:13</reflink>). It was given to Caleb by Joshua as his portion. The Jews interpret the name as meaning "the city of the four", i.e., of Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and Adam, who were all, as they allege, buried there.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Kirjath-huzoth">
    <description>city of streets, Num. 22:39, a Moabite city, which some identify with Kirjathaim. Balak here received and entertained Balaam, whom he had invited from Pethor, among the "mountains of the east," beyond the Euphrates, to lay his ban upon the Israelites, whose progress he had no hope otherwise of arresting. It was probably from the summit of Attarus, the high place near the city, that the soothsayer first saw the encampments of Israel.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Kirjath-jearim">
    <description>city of jaars; i.e., of woods or forests, a Gibeonite town (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 9:17</reflink>) on the border of Benjamin, to which tribe it was assigned (18:15, 28). The ark was brought to this place (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 7:1, 2</reflink>) from Beth-shemesh and put in charge of Abinadab, a Levite. Here it remained till it was removed by David to Jerusalem (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 6:2, 3, 12; 1 Chr. 15:1-29; comp. Ps. 132</reflink>). It was also called Baalah (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 15:9</reflink>) and Kirjath-baal (60). It has been usually identified with Kuriet el-'Enab (i.e., "city of grapes"), among the hills, about 8 miles north-east of 'Ain Shems (i.e., Beth-shemesh). The opinion, however, that it is to be identified with 'Erma, 4 miles east of 'Ain Shems, on the edge of the valley of Sorek, seems to be better supported. (<see target="x-self">See KIRJATH.</see>)</description>
    <description>The words of Ps. 132:6, "We found it in the fields of the wood," refer to the sojourn of the ark at Kirjath-jearim. "Wood" is here the rendering of the Hebrew word _jaar_, which is the singular of _jearim_.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Kirjath-sannah">
    <description>city of the sannah; i.e., of the palm(?), Josh. 15:49; the same as Kirjath-sepher (15:16; Judg. 1:11) and Debir (q.v.), a Canaanitish royal city included in Judah (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 10:38; 15:49</reflink>), and probably the chief seat of learning among the Hittites. It was about 12 miles to the south-west of Hebron.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Kirjath-sepher">
    <description>city of books, Josh. 15:15; same as Kirjath-sannah (q.v.), now represented by the valley of ed-Dhaberiyeh, south-west of Hebron. The name of this town is an evidence that the Canaanites were acquainted with writing and books. "The town probably contained a noted school, or was the site of an oracle and the residence of some learned priest." The "books" were probably engraved stones or bricks.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Kirjathaim">
    <description>two cities; a double city. (1.) A city of refuge in Naphtali (<reflink target="XXX">1 Chr. 6:76</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(2.) A town on the east of Jordan (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 14:5; Deut. 2:9, 10</reflink>). It was assigned to the tribe of Reuben (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 32:37</reflink>). In the time of Ezekiel (25:9) it was one of the four cities which formed the "glory of Moab" (<reflink target="XXX">comp. Jer. 48:1, 23</reflink>). It has been identified with el-Kureiyat, 11 miles south-west of Medeba, on the south slope of Jebel Attarus, the ancient Ataroth.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Kish">
    <description>a bow. (1.) A Levite of the family of Merari (<reflink target="XXX">1 Chr. 23:21; 24:29</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(2.) A Benjamite of Jerusalem (<reflink target="XXX">1 Chr. 8:30; 9:36</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(3.) A Levite in the time of Hezekiah (<reflink target="XXX">2 Chr. 29:12</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(4.) The great-grandfather of Mordecai (<reflink target="XXX">Esther 2:5</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(5.) A Benjamite, the son of Abiel, and father of king Saul (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 9:1, 3; 10:11, 21; 14:51; 2 Sam. 21:14</reflink>). All that is recorded of him is that he sent his son Saul in search of his asses that had strayed, and that he was buried in Zelah. Called Cis, Acts 13:21 (R.V., Kish).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Kishion">
    <description>hardness, a city of Issachar assigned to the Gershonite Levites (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 19:20</reflink>), the same as Kishon (21:28).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Kishon">
    <description>winding, a winter torrent of Central Palestine, which rises about the roots of Tabor and Gilboa, and passing in a northerly direction through the plains of Esdraelon and Acre, falls into the Mediterranean at the north-eastern corner of the bay of Acre, at the foot of Carmel. It is the drain by which the waters of the plain of Esdraelon and of the mountains that surround it find their way to the sea. It bears the modern name of Nahr el-Mokattah, i.e., "the river of slaughter" (comp. 1 Kings 18:40). In the triumphal song of Deborah (<reflink target="XXX">Judg. 5:21</reflink>) it is spoken of as "that ancient river," either (1) because it had flowed on for ages, or (2), according to the Targum, because it was "the torrent in which were shown signs and wonders to Israel of old;" or (3) probably the reference is to the exploits in that region among the ancient Canaanites, for the adjoining plain of Esdraelon was the great battle-field of Palestine.</description>
    <description>This was the scene of the defeat of Sisera (<reflink target="XXX">Judg. 4:7, 13</reflink>), and of the destruction of the prophets of Baal by Elijah (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 18:40</reflink>). "When the Kishon was at its height, it would be, partly on account of its quicksands, as impassable as the ocean itself to a retreating army." (<see target="x-self">See DEBORAH.</see>)</description>

It accompanied social worship as a symbol of brotherly love (<reflink target="XXX">Rom. 16:16; 1 Cor. 16:20; 2 Cor. 13:12; 1 Thess. 5:26; 1 Pet. 5:14</reflink>). The worship of idols was by kissing the image or the hand toward the image (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 19:18; Hos. 13:2</reflink>).</description>

  <item id="Kite">
    <description>an unclean and keen-sighted bird of prey (<reflink target="XXX">Lev. 11:14; Deut. 14:13</reflink>). The Hebrew word used, _'ayet_, is rendered "vulture" in Job 28:7 in Authorized Version, "falcon" in Revised Version. It is probably the red kite (Milvus regalis), a bird of piercing sight and of soaring habits found all over Palestine.</description>

    <description>the vessel in which the dough, after being mixed and leavened, was left to swell or ferment (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 8:3; 12:34; Deut. 28:5, 7</reflink>). The dough in the vessels at the time of the Exodus was still unleavened, because the people were compelled to withdraw in haste.</description>

    <description>(1.) Heb. hereb, "the waster," a sharp instrument for circumcision (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 5:2, 3, lit. "knives of flint;" comp. Ex. 4:25</reflink>); a razor (<reflink target="XXX">Ezek. 5:1</reflink>); a graving tool (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 20:25</reflink>); an axe (<reflink target="XXX">Ezek. 26:9</reflink>).</description>

    <description>(5.) Smaller knives (Heb. ta'ar, Jer. 36:26) were used for sharpening pens. The pruning-knives mentioned in Isa. 18:5 (Heb. mizmaroth) were probably curved knives.</description>

  <item id="Knock">
    <description>"Though Orientals are very jealous of their privacy, they never knock when about to enter your room, but walk in without warning or ceremony. It is nearly impossible to teach an Arab servant to knock at your door. They give warning at the outer gate either by calling or knocking. To stand and call is a very common and respectful mode. Thus Moses commanded the holder of a pledge to stand without and call to the owner to come forth (<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 24:10</reflink>). This was to avoid the violent intrusion of cruel creditors. Peter stood knocking at the outer door (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 12:13, 16</reflink>), and the three men sent to Joppa by Cornelius made inquiry and 'stood before the gate' (10:17, 18). The idea is that the guard over your privacy is to be placed at the entrance."</description>
    <description>Knocking is used as a sign of importunity (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 7:7, 8; Luke 13:25</reflink>), and of the coming of Christ (<reflink target="XXX">Luke 12:36; Rev. 3:20</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Knop">
    <description>some architectural ornament. (1.) Heb. kaphtor (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 25:31-36</reflink>), occurring in the description of the candlestick. It was an ornamental swell beneath the cups of the candlestick, probably an imitation of the fruit of the almond.</description>
    <description>(2.) Heb. peka'im, found only in 1 Kings 6:18 and 7:24, an ornament resembling a small gourd or an egg, on the cedar wainscot in the temple and on the castings on the brim of the brazen sea.</description>

  <item id="Kohath">
    <description>assembly, the second son of Levi, and father of Amram (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 46:11</reflink>). He came down to Egypt with Jacob, and lived to the age of one hundred and thirty-three years (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 6:18</reflink>).</description>

  <item id="Kohathites">
    <description>the descendants of Kohath. They formed the first of the three divisions of the Levites (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 6:16, 18; Num. 3:17</reflink>). In the journeyings of the Israelites they had the charge of the most holy portion of the vessels of the tabernacle, including the ark (Num. 4). Their place in the marching and encampment was south of the tabernacle (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 3:29, 31</reflink>). Their numbers at different times are specified (3:28; 4:36; 26:57, 62).

    <description>(2.) A Levite, the son of Izhar, the brother of Amram, the father of Moses and Aaron (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 6:21</reflink>). The institution of the Aaronic priesthood and the Levitical service at Sinai was a great religious revolution. The old priesthood of the heads of families passed away. This gave rise to murmurings and discontent, while the Israelites were encamped at Kadesh for the first time, which came to a head in a rebellion against Moses and Aaron, headed by Korah, Dathan, and Abiram. Two hundred and fifty princes, "men of renown" i.e., well-known men from among the other tribes, joined this conspiracy. The whole company demanded of Moses and Aaron that the old state of things should be restored, alleging that "they took too much upon them" (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 16:1-3</reflink>). On the morning after the outbreak, Korah and his associates presented themselves at the door of the tabernacle, and "took every man his censer, and put fire in them, and laid incense thereon." But immediately "fire from the Lord" burst forth and destroyed them all (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 16:35</reflink>). Dathan and Abiram "came out and stood in the door of their tents, and their wives, and their sons, and their little children," and it came to pass "that the ground clave asunder that was under them; and the earth opened her mouth and swallowed them up." A plague thereafter began among the people who sympathized in the rebellion, and was only stayed by Aaron's appearing between the living and the dead, and making "an atonement for the people" (16:47).</description>
    <description>The descendants of the sons of Korah who did not participate in the rebellion afterwards rose to eminence in the Levitical service.</description>

  <item id="Korahites">
    <description>that portion of the Kohathites that descended from Korah. (1.) They were an important branch of the singers of the Kohathite division (<reflink target="XXX">2 Chr. 20:19</reflink>). There are eleven psalms (42-49; 84; 85; 87; 88) dedicated to the sons of Korah.</description>
    <description>(2.) Some of the sons of Korah also were "porters" of the temple (<reflink target="XXX">1 Chr. 9:17-19</reflink>); one of them was over "things that were made in the pans" (31), i.e., the baking in pans for the meat-offering (<reflink target="XXX">Lev. 2:5</reflink>).</description>

  <item id="Kore">
    <description>partridge. (1.) A Levite and temple-warder of the Korahites, the son of Asaph. He was father of Shallum and Meshelemiah, temple-porters (<reflink target="XXX">1 Chr. 9:19; 26:1</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(2.) A Levitical porter at the east gate of the temple (<reflink target="XXX">2 Chr. 31:14</reflink>).</description>

    <description>thorn. (1.) A descendant of Judah. 1 Chr. 4:8, "Coz;" R.V., "Hakkoz."</description>
    <description>(2.) A priest, the head of the seventh division of the priests (<reflink target="XXX">Ezra 2:61; Neh. 3:4, 21; 7:63</reflink>). In 1 Chr. 24:10 the word has the article prefixed, and it is taken as a part of the word "Hakkoz."</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Laban">
    <description>white. (1.) The son of Bethuel, who was the son of Nahor, Abraham's brother. He lived at Haran in Mesopotamia. His sister Rebekah was Isaac's wife (Gen. 24). Jacob, one of the sons of this marriage, fled to the house of Laban, whose daughters Leah and Rachel (ch. 29) he eventually married. (See JACOB</description>
    <description>(2.) A city in the Arabian desert in the route of the Israelites (<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 1:1</reflink>), probably identical with Libnah (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 33:20</reflink>).</description>

  <item id="Lachish">
    <description>impregnable, a royal Canaanitish city in the Shephelah, or maritime plain of Palestine (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 10:3, 5; 12:11</reflink>). It was taken and destroyed by the Israelites (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 10:31-33</reflink>). It afterwards became, under Rehoboam, one of the strongest fortresses of Judah (<reflink target="XXX">2 Chr. 10:9</reflink>). It was assaulted and probably taken by Sennacherib (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 18:14, 17; 19:8; Isa. 36:2</reflink>). An account of this siege is given on some slabs found in the chambers of the palace of Koyunjik, and now in the British Museum. The inscription has been deciphered as follows:, "Sennacherib, the mighty king, king of the country of Assyria, sitting on the throne of judgment before the city of Lachish: I gave permission for its slaughter."

    <description>Lachish has been identified with Tell-el-Hesy, where a cuneiform tablet has been found, containing a letter supposed to be from Amenophis at Amarna in reply to one of the Amarna tablets sent by Zimrida from Lachish. This letter is from the chief of Atim (=Etam, 1 Chr. 4:32) to the chief of Lachish, in which the writer expresses great alarm at the approach of marauders from the Hebron hills. "They have entered the land," he says, "to lay waste...strong is he who has come down. He lays waste." This letter shows that "the communication by tablets in cuneiform script was not only usual in writing to Egypt, but in the internal correspondence of the country. The letter, though not so important in some ways as the Moabite stone and the Siloam text, is one of the most valuable discoveries ever made in Palestine" (Conder's Tell Amarna Tablets, p. 134).</description>
    <description>Excavations at Lachish are still going on, and among other discoveries is that of an iron blast-furnace, with slag and ashes, which is supposed to have existed B.C. 1500. If the theories of experts are correct, the use of the hot-air blast instead of cold air (an improvement in iron manufacture patented by Neilson in 1828) was known fifteen hundred years before Christ.

  <item id="Laish">
    <description>a lion. (1.) A city of the Sidonians, in the extreme north of Palestine (<reflink target="XXX">Judg. 18:7, 14</reflink>); called also Leshem (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 19:47</reflink>) and Dan (<reflink target="XXX">Judg. 18:7, 29; Jer. 8:16</reflink>). It lay near the sources of the Jordan, about 4 miles from Paneas. The restless and warlike tribe of Dan (q.v.), looking out for larger possessions, invaded this country and took Laish with its territory. It is identified with the ruin Tell-el-Kady, "the mound of the judge," to the north of the Waters of Merom (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 11:5</reflink>).</description>

    <description>(1.) Heb. kebes, a male lamb from the first to the third year. Offered daily at the morning and the evening sacrifice (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 29:38-42</reflink>), on the Sabbath day (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 28:9</reflink>), at the feast of the New Moon (28:11), of Trumpets (29:2), of Tabernacles (13-40), of Pentecost (<reflink target="XXX">Lev. 23:18-20</reflink>), and of the Passover (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 12:5</reflink>), and on many other occasions (<reflink target="XXX">1 Chr. 29:21; 2 Chr. 29:21; Lev. 9:3; 14:10-25</reflink>).</description>

    <description>The lamb was a symbol of Christ (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 4:4; Ex. 12:3; 29:38; Isa. 16:1; 53:7; John 1:36; Rev. 13:8</reflink>).</description>

His address to his two wives, Adah and Zillah (4:23, 24), is the only extant example of antediluvian poetry. It has been called "Lamech's sword-song." He was "rude and ruffianly," fearing neither God nor man. With him the curtain falls on the race of Cain. We know nothing of his descendants.</description>
    <description>(2.) The seventh in descent from Seth, being the only son of Methuselah. Noah was the oldest of his several sons (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 5:25-31; Luke 3:36</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Lamentation">
    <description>(Heb. qinah), an elegy or dirge. The first example of this form of poetry is the lament of David over Saul and Jonathan (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 1:17-27</reflink>). It was a frequent accompaniment of mourning (<reflink target="XXX">Amos 8:10</reflink>). In 2 Sam. 3:33, 34 is recorded David's lament over Abner. Prophecy sometimes took the form of a lament when it predicted calamity (<reflink target="XXX">Ezek. 27:2, 32; 28:12; 32:2, 16</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Lamentations, Book of">
    <description>called in the Hebrew canon _'Ekhah_, meaning "How," being the formula for the commencement of a song of wailing. It is the first word of the book (see 2 Sam. 1:19-27). The LXX. adopted the name rendered "Lamentations" (Gr. threnoi = Heb. qinoth) now in common use, to denote the character of the book, in which the prophet mourns over the desolations brought on the city and the holy land by Chaldeans. In the Hebrew Bible it is placed among the Khethubim. (<see target="x-self">See BIBLE.</see>)</description>
    <description>As to its authorship, there is no room for hesitancy in following the LXX. and the Targum in ascribing it to Jeremiah. The spirit, tone, language, and subject-matter are in accord with the testimony of tradition in assigning it to him. According to tradition, he retired after the destruction of Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar to a cavern outside the Damascus gate, where he wrote this book. That cavern is still pointed out. "In the face of a rocky hill, on the western side of the city, the local belief has placed 'the grotto of Jeremiah.' There, in that fixed attitude of grief which Michael Angelo has immortalized, the prophet may well be supposed to have mourned the fall of his country" (Stanley, Jewish Church).</description>
    <description>The book consists of five separate poems. In chapter 1 the prophet dwells on the manifold miseries oppressed by which the city sits as a solitary widow weeping sorely. In chapter 2 these miseries are described in connection with the national sins that had caused them. Chapter 3 speaks of hope for the people of God. The chastisement would only be for their good; a better day would dawn for them. Chapter 4 laments the ruin and desolation that had come upon the city and temple, but traces it only to the people's sins. Chapter 5 is a prayer that Zion's reproach may be taken away in the repentance and recovery of the people.</description>
    <description>The first four poems (chapters) are acrostics, like some of the Psalms (25, 34, 37, 119), i.e., each verse begins with a letter of the Hebrew alphabet taken in order. The first, second, and fourth have each twenty-two verses, the number of the letters in the Hebrew alphabet. The third has sixty-six verses, in which each three successive verses begin with the same letter. The fifth is not acrostic.</description>
    <description>Speaking of the "Wailing-place (q.v.) of the Jews" at Jerusalem, a portion of the old wall of the temple of Solomon, Schaff says: "There the Jews assemble every Friday afternoon to bewail the downfall of the holy city, kissing the stone wall and watering it with their tears. They repeat from their well-worn Hebrew Bibles and prayer-books the Lamentations of Jeremiah and suitable Psalms."</description>

It was originally called Diospolis and then Rhoas, but afterwards Laodicea, from Laodice, the wife of Antiochus II., king of Syria, who rebuilt it. It was one of the most important and flourishing cities of Asia Minor. At a very early period it became one of the chief seats of Christianity (<reflink target="XXX">Col. 2:1; 4:15; Rev. 1:11, etc.</reflink>).

This law binds all men at all times. It is generally designated by the term conscience, or the capacity of being influenced by the moral relations of things.</description>
    <description>(2.) The Ceremonial Law prescribes under the Old Testament the rites and ceremonies of worship. This law was obligatory only till Christ, of whom these rites were typical, had finished his work (<reflink target="XXX">Heb. 7:9, 11; 10:1; Eph. 2:16</reflink>). It was fulfilled rather than abrogated by the gospel.</description>
    <description>(3.) The Judicial Law, the law which directed the civil policy of the Hebrew nation.</description>
    <description>(4.) The Moral Law is the revealed will of God as to human conduct, binding on all men to the end of time. It was promulgated at Sinai. It is perfect (<reflink target="XXX">Ps. 19:7</reflink>), perpetual (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 5:17, 18</reflink>), holy (<reflink target="XXX">Rom. 7:12</reflink>), good, spiritual (14), and exceeding broad (<reflink target="XXX">Ps. 119:96</reflink>). Although binding on all, we are not under it as a covenant of works (<reflink target="XXX">Gal. 3:17</reflink>). (See COMMANDMENTS</description>

    <description>(2.) Heb. hamets, properly "ferment." In Num. 6:3, "vinegar of wine" is more correctly "fermented wine." In Ex. 13:7, the proper rendering would be, "Unfermented things [Heb. matstsoth] shall be consumed during the seven days; and there shall not be seen with thee fermented things [hamets], and there shall not be seen with thee leavened mass [seor] in all thy borders." The chemical definition of ferment or yeast is "a substance in a state of putrefaction, the atoms of which are in a continual motion."</description>
    <description>The use of leaven was strictly forbidden in all offerings made to the Lord by fire (<reflink target="XXX">Lev. 2:11; 7:12; 8:2; Num. 6:15</reflink>). Its secretly penetrating and diffusive power is referred to in 1 Cor. 5:6. In this respect it is used to illustrate the growth of the kingdom of heaven both in the individual heart and in the world (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 13:33</reflink>).

  <item id="Lebanon">
    <description>white, "the white mountain of Syria," is the loftiest and most celebrated mountain range in Syria. It is a branch running southward from the Caucasus, and at its lower end forking into two parallel ranges, the eastern or Anti-Lebanon, and the western or Lebanon proper. They enclose a long valley (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 11:17</reflink>) of from 5 to 8 miles in width, called by Roman writers Coele-Syria, now called el-Buka'a, "the valley," a prolongation of the valley of the Jordan.</description>
    <description>Lebanon proper, Jebel es-Sharki, commences at its southern extremity in the gorge of the Leontes, the ancient Litany, and extends north-east, parallel to the Mediterranean coast, as far as the river Eleutherus, at the plain of Emesa, "the entering of Hamath" (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 34:8; 1 Kings 8:65</reflink>), in all about 90 geographical miles in extent. The average height of this range is from 6,000 to 8,000 feet; the peak of Jebel Mukhmel is about 10,200 feet, and the Sannin about 9,000. The highest peaks are covered with perpetual snow and ice. In the recesses of the range wild beasts as of old still abound (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 14:9; Cant. 4:8</reflink>). The scenes of the Lebanon are remarkable for their grandeur and beauty, and supplied the sacred writers with many expressive similes (<reflink target="XXX">Ps. 29:5, 6; 72:16; 104:16-18; Cant. 4:15; Isa. 2:13; 35:2; 60:13; Hos. 14:5</reflink>). It is famous for its cedars (<reflink target="XXX">Cant. 5:15</reflink>), its wines (<reflink target="XXX">Hos. 14:7</reflink>), and its cool waters (<reflink target="XXX">Jer. 18:14</reflink>). The ancient inhabitants were Giblites and Hivites (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 13:5; Judg. 3:3</reflink>). It was part of the Phoenician kingdom (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 5:2-6</reflink>).</description>
    <description>The eastern range, or Anti-Lebanon, or "Lebanon towards the sunrising," runs nearly parallel with the western from the plain of Emesa till it connects with the hills of Galilee in the south. The height of this range is about 5,000 feet. Its highest peak is Hermon (q.v.), from which a number of lesser ranges radiate.</description>
    <description>Lebanon is first mentioned in the description of the boundary of Palestine (<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 1:7; 11:24</reflink>). It was assigned to Israel, but was never conquered (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 13:2-6; Judg. 3:1-3</reflink>).</description>
    <description>The Lebanon range is now inhabited by a population of about 300,000 Christians, Maronites, and Druses, and is ruled by a Christian governor. The Anti-Lebanon is inhabited by Mohammedans, and is under a Turkish ruler.</description>

It was applied to "lees" from the custom of allowing wine to stand on the lees that it might thereby be better preserved (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 25:6</reflink>). "Men settled on their lees" (<reflink target="XXX">Zeph. 1:12</reflink>) are men "hardened or crusted." The image is derived from the crust formed at the bottom of wines long left undisturbed (<reflink target="XXX">Jer. 48:11</reflink>). The effect of wealthy undisturbed ease on the ungodly is hardening. They become stupidly secure (<reflink target="XXX">comp. Ps. 55:19; Amos 6:1</reflink>). To drink the lees (<reflink target="XXX">Ps. 75:8</reflink>) denotes severe suffering.</description>

  <item id="Left-handed">
    <description>(<reflink target="XXX">Judg. 3:15; 20:16</reflink>), one unable to use the right hand skilfully, and who therefore uses the left; and also one who uses the left as well as the right, ambidexter. Such a condition of the hands is due to physical causes. This quality was common apparently in the tribe of Benjamin.</description>

  <item id="Legion">
    <description>a regiment of the Roman army, the number of men composing which differed at different times. It originally consisted of three thousand men, but in the time of Christ consisted of six thousand, exclusive of horsemen, who were in number a tenth of the foot-men. The word is used (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 26:53; Mark 5:9</reflink>) to express simply a great multitude.</description>

  <item id="Lehi">
    <description>a jawbone, a place in the tribe of Judah where Samson achieved a victory over the Philistines (<reflink target="XXX">Judg. 15:9, 14, 16</reflink>), slaying a thousand of them with the jawbone of an ass. The words in 15:19, "a hollow place that was in the jaw" (A.V.), should be, as in Revised Version, "the hollow place that is in Lehi."</description>

  <item id="Lentiles">
    <description>(Heb. 'adashim), a species of vetch (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 25:34; 2 Sam. 23:11</reflink>), common in Syria under the name addas. The red pottage made by Jacob was of lentils (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 25:29-34</reflink>). They were among the provisions brought to David when he fled from Absalom (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 17:28</reflink>). It is the Ervum lens of Linnaeus, a leguminous plant which produces a fruit resembling a bean.</description>

  <item id="Leopard">
    <description>(Heb. namer, so called because spotted, Cant. 4:8), was that great spotted feline which anciently infested the mountains of Syria, more appropriately called a panther (Felis pardus). Its fierceness (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 11:6</reflink>), its watching for its prey (<reflink target="XXX">Jer. 5:6</reflink>), its swiftness (<reflink target="XXX">Hab. 1:8</reflink>), and the spots of its skin (<reflink target="XXX">Jer. 13:23</reflink>), are noticed. This word is used symbolically (<reflink target="XXX">Dan. 7:6; Rev. 13:2</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Leprosy">
    <description>(Heb. tsara'ath, a "smiting," a "stroke," because the disease was regarded as a direct providential infliction). This name is from the Greek lepra, by which the Greek physicians designated the disease from its scaliness. We have the description of the disease, as well as the regulations connected with it, in Lev. 13; 14; Num. 12:10-15, etc. There were reckoned six different circumstances under which it might develop itself, (1) without any apparent cause (<reflink target="XXX">Lev. 13:2-8</reflink>); (2) its reappearance (9-17); (3) from an inflammation (18-28); (4) on the head or chin (29-37); (5) in white polished spots (38, 39); (6) at the back or in the front of the head (40-44).</description>
    <description>Lepers were required to live outside the camp or city (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 5:1-4; 12:10-15, etc.</reflink>). This disease was regarded as an awful punishment from the Lord (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 5:7; 2 Chr. 26:20</reflink>). (<see target="x-self">See MIRIAM; GEHAZI; UZZIAH.</see>)</description>
    <description>This disease "begins with specks on the eyelids and on the palms, gradually spreading over the body, bleaching the hair white wherever they appear, crusting the affected parts with white scales, and causing terrible sores and swellings. From the skin the disease eats inward to the bones, rotting the whole body piecemeal." "In Christ's day no leper could live in a walled town, though he might in an open village. But wherever he was he was required to have his outer garment rent as a sign of deep grief, to go bareheaded, and to cover his beard with his mantle, as if in lamentation at his own virtual death. He had further to warn passers-by to keep away from him, by calling out, 'Unclean! unclean!' nor could he speak to any one, or receive or return a salutation, since in the East this involves an embrace."</description>
    <description>That the disease was not contagious is evident from the regulations regarding it (<reflink target="XXX">Lev. 13:12, 13, 36; 2 Kings 5:1</reflink>). Leprosy was "the outward and visible sign of the innermost spiritual corruption; a meet emblem in its small beginnings, its gradual spread, its internal disfigurement, its dissolution little by little of the whole body, of that which corrupts, degrades, and defiles man's inner nature, and renders him unmeet to enter the presence of a pure and holy God" (Maclear's Handbook O.T). Our Lord cured lepers (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 8:2, 3; Mark 1:40-42</reflink>). This divine power so manifested illustrates his gracious dealings with men in curing the leprosy of the soul, the fatal taint of sin.</description>

  <item id="Letter">
    <description>in Rom. 2:27, 29 means the outward form. The "oldness of the letter" (7:6) is a phrase which denotes the old way of literal outward obedience to the law as a system of mere external rules of conduct. In 2 Cor. 3:6, "the letter" means the Mosaic law as a written law. (<see target="x-self">See WRITING.</see>)</description>

    <description>adhesion. (1.) The third son of Jacob by Leah. The origin of the name is found in Leah's words (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 29:34</reflink>), "This time will my husband be joined [Heb. yillaveh] unto me." He is mentioned as taking a prominent part in avenging his sister Dinah (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 34:25-31</reflink>). He and his three sons went down with Jacob (46:11) into Egypt, where he died at the age of one hundred and thirty-seven years (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 6:16</reflink>).</description>

  <item id="Leviathan">
    <description>a transliterated Hebrew word (livyathan), meaning "twisted," "coiled." In Job 3:8, Revised Version, and marg. of Authorized Version, it denotes the dragon which, according to Eastern tradition, is an enemy of light; in 41:1 the crocodile is meant; in Ps. 104:26 it "denotes any large animal that moves by writhing or wriggling the body, the whale, the monsters of the deep." This word is also used figuratively for a cruel enemy, as some think "the Egyptian host, crushed by the divine power, and cast on the shores of the Red Sea" (<reflink target="XXX">Ps. 74:14</reflink>). As used in Isa. 27:1, "leviathan the piercing [R.V. 'swift'] serpent, even leviathan that crooked [R.V. marg. 'winding'] serpent," the word may probably denote the two empires, the Assyrian and the Babylonian.</description>

  <item id="Levirate Law">
    <description>from Latin levir, "a husband's brother," the name of an ancient custom ordained by Moses, by which, when an Israelite died without issue, his surviving brother was required to marry the widow, so as to continue his brother's family through the son that might be born of that marriage (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 38:8; Deut. 25:5-10; comp. Ruth 3; 4:10</reflink>). Its object was "to raise up seed to the departed brother."</description>

  <item id="Levite">
    <description>a descendant of the tribe of Levi (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 6:25; Lev. 25:32; Num. 35:2; Josh. 21:3, 41</reflink>). This name is, however, generally used as the title of that portion of the tribe which was set apart for the subordinate offices of the sanctuary service (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 8:4; Ezra 2:70</reflink>), as assistants to the priests.</description>
    <description>When the Israelites left Egypt, the ancient manner of worship was still observed by them, the eldest son of each house inheriting the priest's office. At Sinai the first change in this ancient practice was made. A hereditary priesthood in the family of Aaron was then instituted (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 28:1</reflink>). But it was not till that terrible scene in connection with the sin of the golden calf that the tribe of Levi stood apart and began to occupy a distinct position (Ex. 32). The religious primogeniture was then conferred on this tribe, which henceforth was devoted to the service of the sanctuary (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 3:11-13</reflink>). They were selected for this purpose because of their zeal for the glory of God (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 32:26</reflink>), and because, as the tribe to which Moses and Aaron belonged, they would naturally stand by the lawgiver in his work.</description>
    <description>The Levitical order consisted of all the descendants of Levi's three sons, Gershon, Kohath, and Merari; whilst Aaron, Amram's son (Amram, son of Kohat), and his issue constituted the priestly order.</description>
    <description>The age and qualification for Levitical service are specified in Num. 4:3, 23, 30, 39, 43, 47.</description>
    <description>They were not included among the armies of Israel (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 1:47; 2:33; 26:62</reflink>), but were reckoned by themselves. They were the special guardians of the tabernacle (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 1:51; 18:22-24</reflink>). The Gershonites pitched their tents on the west of the tabernacle (3:23), the Kohathites on the south (3:29), the Merarites on the north (3:35), and the priests on the east (3:38). It was their duty to move the tent and carry the parts of the sacred structure from place to place. They were given to Aaron and his sons the priests to wait upon them and do work for them at the sanctuary services (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 8:19; 18:2-6</reflink>).</description>
    <description>As being wholly consecrated to the service of the Lord, they had no territorial possessions. Jehovah was their inheritance (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 18:20; 26:62; Deut. 10:9; 18:1, 2</reflink>), and for their support it was ordained that they should receive from the other tribes the tithes of the produce of the land. Forty-eight cities also were assigned to them, thirteen of which were for the priests "to dwell in", i.e., along with their other inhabitants. Along with their dwellings they had "suburbs", i.e., "commons", for their herds and flocks, and also fields and vineyards (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 35:2-5</reflink>). Nine of these cities were in Judah, three in Naphtali, and four in each of the other tribes (Josh. 21). Six of the Levitical cities were set apart as "cities of refuge" (q.v.). Thus the Levites were scattered among the tribes to keep alive among them the knowledge and service of God. (See PRIEST</description>

  <item id="Leviticus">
    <description>the third book of the Pentateuch; so called in the Vulgate, after the LXX., because it treats chiefly of the Levitical service.</description>
    <description>In the first section of the book (1-17), which exhibits the worship itself, there is, (1.) A series of laws (1-7) regarding sacrifices, burnt-offerings, meat-offerings, and thank-offerings (1-3), sin-offerings and trespass-offerings (4; 5), followed by the law of the priestly duties in connection with the offering of sacrifices (6; 7). (2.) An historical section (8-10), giving an account of the consecration of Aaron and his sons (8); Aaron's first offering for himself and the people (9); Nadab and Abihu's presumption in offering "strange fire before Jehovah," and their punishment (10). (3.) Laws concerning purity, and the sacrifices and ordinances for putting away impurity (11-16). An interesting fact may be noted here. Canon Tristram, speaking of the remarkable discoveries regarding the flora and fauna of the Holy Land by the Palestine Exploration officers, makes the following statement:, "Take these two catalogues of the clean and unclean animals in the books of Leviticus [11] and Deuteronomy [14]. There are eleven in Deuteronomy which do not occur in Leviticus, and these are nearly all animals and birds which are not found in Egypt or the Holy Land, but which are numerous in the Arabian desert. They are not named in Leviticus a few weeks after the departure from Egypt; but after the people were thirty-nine years in the desert they are named, a strong proof that the list in Deuteronomy was written at the end of the journey, and the list in Leviticus at the beginning. It fixes the writing of that catalogue to one time and period only, viz., that when the children of Israel were familiar with the fauna and the flora of the desert" (Palest. Expl. Quart., Jan. 1887). (4.) Laws marking the separation between Israel and the heathen (17-20). (5.) Laws about the personal purity of the priests, and their eating of the holy things (20; 21); about the offerings of Israel, that they were to be without blemish (22:17-33); and about the due celebration of the great festivals (23; 25). (6.) Then follow promises and warnings to the people regarding obedience to these commandments, closing with a section on vows.</description>
    <description>The various ordinances contained in this book were all delivered in the space of a month (<reflink target="XXX">comp. Ex. 40:17; Num. 1:1</reflink>), the first month of the second year after the Exodus. It is the third book of Moses.</description>
    <description>No book contains more of the very words of God. He is almost throughout the whole of it the direct speaker. This book is a prophecy of things to come, a shadow whereof the substance is Christ and his kingdom. The principles on which it is to be interpreted are laid down in the Epistle to the Hebrews. It contains in its complicated ceremonial the gospel of the grace of God.</description>

  <item id="Lewdness">
    <description>(<reflink target="XXX">Acts 18:14</reflink>), villany or wickedness, not lewdness in the modern sense of the word. The word "lewd" is from the Saxon, and means properly "ignorant," "unlearned," and hence low, vicious (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 17:5</reflink>).</description>

In A.D. 19 these manumitted Jews were banished from Rome. Many of them found their way to Jerusalem, and there established a synagogue.</description>

It became one of the Levitical towns in the tribe of Judah (21:13), and was strongly fortified. Sennacherib laid siege to it (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 19:8; Isa. 37:8</reflink>). It was the native place of Hamutal, the queen of Josiah (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 23:31</reflink>).

  <item id="Lice">
    <description>(Heb. kinnim), the creatures employed in the third plague sent upon Egypt (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 8:16-18</reflink>). They were miraculously produced from the dust of the land. "The entomologists Kirby and Spence place these minute but disgusting insects in the very front rank of those which inflict injury upon man. A terrible list of examples they have collected of the ravages of this and closely allied parasitic pests." The plague of lice is referred to in Ps. 105:31.</description>
    <description>Some have supposed that the word denotes not lice properly, but gnats. Others, with greater probability, take it to mean the "tick" which is much larger than lice.</description>

  <item id="Light">
    <description>the offspring of the divine command (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 1:3</reflink>). "All the more joyous emotions of the mind, all the pleasing sensations of the frame, all the happy hours of domestic intercourse were habitually described among the Hebrews under imagery derived from light" (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 11:36; Isa. 58:8; Esther 8:16; Ps. 97:11</reflink>). Light came also naturally to typify true religion and the felicity it imparts (<reflink target="XXX">Ps. 119:105; Isa. 8:20; Matt. 4:16, etc.</reflink>), and the glorious inheritance of the redeemed (<reflink target="XXX">Col. 1:12; Rev. 21:23-25</reflink>). God is said to dwell in light inaccessible (<reflink target="XXX">1 Tim. 6:16</reflink>). It frequently signifies instruction (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 5:16; John 5:35</reflink>). In its highest sense it is applied to Christ as the "Sun of righteousness" (<reflink target="XXX">Mal. 4:2; Luke 2:32; John 1:7-9</reflink>). God is styled "the Father of lights" (<reflink target="XXX">James 1:17</reflink>). It is used of angels (<reflink target="XXX">2 Cor. 11:14</reflink>), and of John the Baptist, who was a "burning and a shining light" (<reflink target="XXX">John 5:35</reflink>), and of all true disciples, who are styled "the light of the world" (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 5:14</reflink>).</description>

  <item id="Ligure">
    <description>(Heb. leshem) occurs only in Ex. 28:19 and 39:12, as the name of a stone in the third row on the high priest's breastplate. Some have supposed that this stone was the same as the jacinth (q.v.), others that it was the opal. There is now no mineral bearing this name. The "ligurite" is so named from Liguria in Italy, where it was found.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Lily">
    <description>The Hebrew name shushan or shoshan, i.e., "whiteness", was used as the general name of several plants common to Syria, such as the tulip, iris, anemone, gladiolus, ranunculus, etc. Some interpret it, with much probability, as denoting in the Old Testament the water-lily (Nymphoea lotus of Linn.), or lotus (<reflink target="XXX">Cant. 2:1, 2; 2:16; 4:5; 5:13; 6:2, 3; 7:2</reflink>). "Its flowers are large, and they are of a white colour, with streaks of pink. They supplied models for the ornaments of the pillars and the molten sea" (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 7:19, 22, 26; 2 Chr. 4:5</reflink>). In the Canticles its beauty and fragrance shadow forth the preciousness of Christ to the Church. Groser, however (Scrip. Nat. Hist.), strongly argues that the word, both in the Old and New Testaments, denotes liliaceous plants in general, or if one genus is to be selected, that it must be the genus Iris, which is "large, vigorous, elegant in form, and gorgeous in colouring."</description>
    <description>The lilies (Gr. krinia) spoken of in the New Testament (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 6:28; Luke 12:27</reflink>) were probably the scarlet martagon (Lilium Chalcedonicum) or "red Turk's-cap lily", which "comes into flower at the season of the year when our Lord's sermon on the mount is supposed to have been delivered. It is abundant in the district of Galilee; and its fine scarlet flowers render it a very conspicous and showy object, which would naturally attract the attention of the hearers" (Balfour's Plants of the Bible).</description>
    <description>Of the true "floral glories of Palestine" the pheasant's eye (Adonis Palestina), the ranunuculus (R. Asiaticus), and the anemone (A coronaria), the last named is however, with the greatest probability regarded as the "lily of the field" to which our Lord refers. "Certainly," says Tristram (Nat. Hist. of the Bible), "if, in the wondrous richness of bloom which characterizes the land of Israel in spring, any one plant can claim pre-eminence, it is the anemone, the most natural flower for our Lord to pluck and seize upon as an illustration, whether walking in the fields or sitting on the hill-side." "The white water-lily (Nymphcea alba) and the yellow water-lily (Nuphar lutea) are both abundant in the marshes of the Upper Jordan, but have no connection with the lily of Scripture."</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Lime">
    <description>The Hebrew word so rendered means "boiling" or "effervescing." From Isa. 33:12 it appears that lime was made in a kiln lighted by thorn-bushes. In Amos 2:1 it is recorded that the king of Moab "burned the bones of the king of Edom into lime." The same Hebrew word is used in Deut. 27:2-4, and is there rendered "plaster." Limestone is the chief constituent of the mountains of Syria.</description>

  <item id="Linen">
    <description>(1.) Heb., pishet, pishtah, denotes "flax," of which linen is made (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 19:9</reflink>); wrought flax, i.e., "linen cloth", Lev. 13:47, 48, 52, 59; Deut. 22:11.</description>
    <description>Flax was early cultivated in Egypt (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 9:31</reflink>), and also in Palestine (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 2:6; Hos. 2:9</reflink>). Various articles were made of it: garments (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 6:14</reflink>), girdles (<reflink target="XXX">Jer. 13:1</reflink>), ropes and thread (<reflink target="XXX">Ezek. 40:3</reflink>), napkins (<reflink target="XXX">Luke 24:12; John 20:7</reflink>), turbans (<reflink target="XXX">Ezek. 44:18</reflink>), and lamp-wicks (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 42:3</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(2.) Heb. buts, "whiteness;" rendered "fine linen" in 1 Chr. 4:21; 15:27; 2 Chr. 2:14; 3:14; Esther 1:6; 8:15, and "white linen" 2 Chr. 5:12. It is not certain whether this word means cotton or linen.</description>
    <description>(3.) Heb. bad; rendered "linen" Ex. 28:42; 39:28; Lev. 6:10; 16:4, 23, 32; 1 Sam. 2:18; 2 Sam. 6:14, etc. It is uniformly used of the sacred vestments worn by the priests. The word is from a root signifying "separation."</description>
    <description>(4.) Heb. shesh; rendered "fine linen" Ex. 25:4; 26:1, 31, 36, etc. In Prov. 31:22 it is rendered in Authorized Version "silk," and in Revised Version "fine linen." The word denotes Egyptian linen of peculiar whiteness and fineness (byssus). The finest Indian linen, the finest now made, has in an inch one hundred threads of warp and eighty-four of woof; while the Egyptian had sometimes one hundred and forty in the warp and sixty-four in the woof. This was the usual dress of the Egyptian priest. Pharaoh arrayed Joseph in a dress of linen (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 41:42</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(5.) Heb. 'etun. Prov. 7:16, "fine linen of Egypt;" in Revised Version, "the yarn of Egypt."</description>
    <description>(6.) Heb. sadin. Prov. 31:24, "fine linen;" in Revised Version, "linen garments" (<reflink target="XXX">Judg. 14:12, 13; Isa. 3:23</reflink>). From this Hebrew word is probably derived the Greek word sindon, rendered "linen" in Mark 14:51, 52; 15:46; Matt. 27:59.</description>
    <description>The word "linen" is used as an emblem of moral purity (<reflink target="XXX">Rev. 15:6</reflink>). In Luke 16:19 it is mentioned as a mark of luxury.</description>

  <item id="Lions">
    <description>the most powerful of all carnivorous animals. Although not now found in Palestine, they must have been in ancient times very numerous there. They had their lairs in the forests (<reflink target="XXX">Jer. 5:6; 12:8; Amos 3:4</reflink>), in the caves of the mountains (<reflink target="XXX">Cant. 4:8; Nah. 2:12</reflink>), and in the canebrakes on the banks of the Jordan (<reflink target="XXX">Jer. 49:19; 50:44; Zech. 11:3</reflink>).</description>
    <description>No fewer than at least six different words are used in the Old Testament for the lion. (1.) _Gor_ (i.e., a "suckling"), the lion's whelp (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 49:9; Jer. 51:38, etc.</reflink>). (2.) _Kephir_ (i.e., "shaggy"), the young lion (<reflink target="XXX">Judg. 14:5; Job 4:10; Ps. 91:13; 104:21</reflink>), a term which is also used figuratively of cruel enemies (<reflink target="XXX">Ps. 34:10; 35:17; 58:6; Jer. 2:15</reflink>). (3.) _'Ari_ (i.e., the "puller" in pieces), denoting the lion in general, without reference to age or sex (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 23:24; 2 Sam. 17:10, etc.</reflink>). (4.) _Shahal_ (the "roarer"), the mature lion (<reflink target="XXX">Job 4:10; Ps. 91:13; Prov. 26:13; Hos. 5:14</reflink>). (5.) _Laish_, so called from its strength and bravery (<reflink target="XXX">Job 4:11; Prov. 30:30; Isa. 30:6</reflink>). The capital of Northern Dan received its name from this word. (6.) _Labi_, from a root meaning "to roar," a grown lion or lioness (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 49:9; Num. 23:24; 24:9; Ezek. 19:2; Nah. 2:11</reflink>).</description>
    <description>The lion of Palestine was properly of the Asiatic variety, distinguished from the African variety, which is larger. Yet it not only attacked flocks in the presence of the shepherd, but also laid waste towns and villages (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 17:25, 26</reflink>) and devoured men (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 13:24, 25</reflink>). Shepherds sometimes, single-handed, encountered lions and slew them (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 17:34, 35; Amos 3:12</reflink>). Samson seized a young lion with his hands and "rent him as he would have rent a kid" (<reflink target="XXX">Judg. 14:5, 6</reflink>). The strength (<reflink target="XXX">Judg. 14:18</reflink>), courage (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 17:10</reflink>), and ferocity (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 49:9</reflink>) of the lion were proverbial.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Lip">
    <description>besides its literal sense (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 37:29, etc.</reflink>), is used in the original (saphah) metaphorically for an edge or border, as of a cup (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 7:26</reflink>), a garment (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 28:32</reflink>), a curtain (26:4), the sea (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 22:17</reflink>), the Jordan (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 2:13</reflink>). To "open the lips" is to begin to speak (<reflink target="XXX">Job 11:5</reflink>); to "refrain the lips" is to keep silence (<reflink target="XXX">Ps. 40:9; 1 Pet. 3:10</reflink>). The "fruit of the lips" (<reflink target="XXX">Heb. 13:15</reflink>) is praise, and the "calves of the lips" thank-offerings (<reflink target="XXX">Hos. 14:2</reflink>). To "shoot out the lip" is to manifest scorn and defiance (<reflink target="XXX">Ps. 22:7</reflink>). Many similar forms of expression are found in Scripture.</description>

  <item id="Litter">
    <description>(Heb. tsab, as being lightly and gently borne), a sedan or palanquin for the conveyance of persons of rank (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 66:20</reflink>). In Num. 7:3, the words "covered wagons" are more literally "carts of the litter kind." There they denote large and commodious vehicles drawn by oxen, and fitted for transporting the furniture of the temple.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Liver">
    <description>(Heb. kabhed, "heavy;" hence the liver, as being the heaviest of the viscera, Ex. 29:13, 22; Lev. 3:4, 1, 10, 15) was burnt upon the altar, and not used as sacrificial food. In Ezek. 21:21 there is allusion, in the statement that the king of Babylon "looked upon the liver," to one of the most ancient of all modes of divination. The first recorded instance of divination (q.v.) is that of the teraphim of Laban. By the teraphim the LXX. and Josephus understood "the liver of goats." By the "caul above the liver," in Lev. 4:9; 7:4, etc., some understand the great lobe of the liver itself.</description>

They are distinguished from angels (<reflink target="XXX">Rev. 15:7</reflink>); they join the elders in the "new song" (5:8, 9); they warn of danger from divine justice (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 6:3-5</reflink>), and deliver the commission to those who execute it (<reflink target="XXX">Ezek. 10:2, 7</reflink>); they associate with the elders in their sympathy with the hundred and forty-four thousand who sing the new song (<reflink target="XXX">Rev. 14:3</reflink>), and with the Church in the overthrow of her enemies (19:4).</description>

  <item id="Loan">
    <description>The Mosaic law required that when an Israelite needed to borrow, what he asked was to be freely lent to him, and no interest was to be charged, although interest might be taken of a foreigner (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 22:25; Deut. 23:19, 20; Lev. 25:35-38</reflink>). At the end of seven years all debts were remitted. Of a foreigner the loan might, however, be exacted. At a later period of the Hebrew commonwealth, when commerce increased, the practice of exacting usury or interest on loans, and of suretiship in the commercial sense, grew up. Yet the exaction of it from a Hebrew was regarded as discreditable (<reflink target="XXX">Ps. 15:5; Prov. 6:1, 4; 11:15; 17:18; 20:16; 27:13; Jer. 15:10</reflink>).</description>
    <description>Limitations are prescribed by the law to the taking of a pledge from the borrower. The outer garment in which a man slept at night, if taken in pledge, was to be returned before sunset (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 22:26, 27; Deut. 24:12, 13</reflink>). A widow's garment (<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 24:17</reflink>) and a millstone (6) could not be taken. A creditor could not enter the house to reclaim a pledge, but must remain outside till the borrower brought it (10, 11). The Hebrew debtor could not be retained in bondage longer than the seventh year, or at farthest the year of jubilee (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 21:2; Lev. 25:39, 42</reflink>), but foreign sojourners were to be "bondmen for ever" (<reflink target="XXX">Lev. 25:44-54</reflink>).</description>

  <item id="Locust">
    <description>There are ten Hebrew words used in Scripture to signify locust. In the New Testament locusts are mentioned as forming part of the food of John the Baptist (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 3:4; Mark 1:6</reflink>). By the Mosaic law they were reckoned "clean," so that he could lawfully eat them. The name also occurs in Rev. 9:3, 7, in allusion to this Oriental devastating insect.</description>
    <description>Locusts belong to the class of Orthoptera, i.e., straight-winged. They are of many species. The ordinary Syrian locust resembles the grasshopper, but is larger and more destructive. "The legs and thighs of these insects are so powerful that they can leap to a height of two hundred times the length of their bodies. When so raised they spread their wings and fly so close together as to appear like one compact moving mass." Locusts are prepared as food in various ways. Sometimes they are pounded, and then mixed with flour and water, and baked into cakes; "sometimes boiled, roasted, or stewed in butter, and then eaten." They were eaten in a preserved state by the ancient Assyrians.</description>
    <description>The devastations they make in Eastern lands are often very appalling. The invasions of locusts are the heaviest calamites that can befall a country. "Their numbers exceed computation: the hebrews called them 'the countless,' and the Arabs knew them as 'the darkeners of the sun.' Unable to guide their own flight, though capable of crossing large spaces, they are at the mercy of the wind, which bears them as blind instruments of Providence to the doomed region given over to them for the time. Innumerable as the drops of water or the sands of the seashore, their flight obscures the sun and casts a thick shadow on the earth (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 10:15; Judg. 6:5; 7:12; Jer. 46:23; Joel 2:10</reflink>). It seems indeed as if a great aerial mountain, many miles in breadth, were advancing with a slow, unresting progress. Woe to the countries beneath them if the wind fall and let them alight! They descend unnumbered as flakes of snow and hide the ground. It may be 'like the garden of Eden before them, but behind them is a desolate wilderness. At their approach the people are in anguish; all faces lose their colour' (<reflink target="XXX">Joel 2:6</reflink>). No walls can stop them; no ditches arrest them; fires kindled in their path are forthwith extinguished by the myriads of their dead, and the countless armies march on (<reflink target="XXX">Joel 2:8, 9</reflink>). If a door or a window be open, they enter and destroy everything of wood in the house. Every terrace, court, and inner chamber is filled with them in a moment. Such an awful visitation swept over Egypt (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 10:1-19</reflink>), consuming before it every green thing, and stripping the trees, till the land was bared of all signs of vegetation. A strong north-west wind from the Mediterranean swept the locusts into the Red Sea.", Geikie's Hours, etc., ii., 149.</description>

  <item id="Lodge">
    <description>a shed for a watchman in a garden (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 1:8</reflink>). The Hebrew name _melunah_ is rendered "cottage" (q.v.) in Isa. 24:20. It also denotes a hammock or hanging-bed.</description>

  <item id="Log">
    <description>the smallest measure for liquids used by the Hebrews (<reflink target="XXX">Lev. 14:10, 12, 15, 21, 24</reflink>), called in the Vulgate sextarius. It is the Hebrew unit of measure of capacity, and is equal to the contents of six ordinary hen's eggs=the twelfth part of a him, or nearly a pint.</description>

  </item>
  <item id="Lord">
    <description>There are various Hebrew and Greek words so rendered.</description>
    <description>(1.) Heb. Jehovah, has been rendered in the English Bible LORD, printed in small capitals. This is the proper name of the God of the Hebrews. The form "Jehovah" is retained only in Ex. 6:3; Ps. 83:18; Isa. 12:2; 26:4, both in the Authorized and the Revised Version.</description>
    <description>(2.) Heb. 'adon, means one possessed of absolute control. It denotes a master, as of slaves (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 24:14, 27</reflink>), or a ruler of his subjects (45:8), or a husband, as lord of his wife (18:12).</description>
    <description>The old plural form of this Hebrew word is _'adonai_. From a superstitious reverence for the name "Jehovah," the Jews, in reading their Scriptures, whenever that name occurred, always pronounced it _'Adonai_.</description>
    <description>(3.) Greek kurios, a supreme master, etc. In the LXX. this is invariably used for "Jehovah" and "'Adonai."</description>
    <description>(4.) Heb. ba'al, a master, as having domination. This word is applied to human relations, as that of husband, to persons skilled in some art or profession, and to heathen deities. "The men of Shechem," literally "the baals of Shechem" (<reflink target="XXX">Judg. 9:2, 3</reflink>). These were the Israelite inhabitants who had reduced the Canaanites to a condition of vassalage (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 16:10; 17:13</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(5.) Heb. seren, applied exclusively to the "lords of the Philistines" (<reflink target="XXX">Judg. 3:3</reflink>). The LXX. render it by satrapies. At this period the Philistines were not, as at a later period (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 21:10</reflink>), under a kingly government. (<reflink target="XXX">See Josh. 13:3; 1 Sam. 6:18.</reflink>) There were five such lordships, viz., Gath, Ashdod, Gaza, Ashkelon, and Ekron.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Lord's day">
    <description>only once, in Rev. 1:10, was in the early Christian ages used to denote the first day of the week, which commemorated the Lord's resurrection. There is every reason to conclude that John thus used the name. (<see target="x-self">See SABBATH.</see>)</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Lord's Prayer">
    <description>the name given to the only form of prayer Christ taught his disciples (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 6:9-13</reflink>). The closing doxology of the prayer is omitted by Luke (11:2-4), also in the R.V. of Matt. 6:13. This prayer contains no allusion to the atonement of Christ, nor to the offices of the Holy Spirit. "All Christian prayer is based on the Lord's Prayer, but its spirit is also guided by that of His prayer in Gethsemane and of the prayer recorded John 17. The Lord's Prayer is the comprehensive type of the simplest and most universal prayer."</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Lord's Supper">
    <description>(<reflink target="XXX">1 Cor. 11:20</reflink>), called also "the Lord's table" (10:21), "communion," "cup of blessing" (10:16), and "breaking of bread" (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 2:42</reflink>).</description>
    <description>In the early Church it was called also "eucharist," or giving of thanks (<reflink target="XXX">comp. Matt. 26:27</reflink>), and generally by the Latin Church "mass," a name derived from the formula of dismission, Ite, missa est, i.e., "Go, it is discharged."</description>
    <description>The account of the institution of this ordinance is given in Matt. 26:26-29, Mark 14:22-25, Luke 22:19, 20, and 1 Cor. 11:24-26. It is not mentioned by John.</description>
    <description>It was designed, (1.) To commemorate the death of Christ: "This do in remembrance of me." (2.) To signify, seal, and apply to believers all the benefits of the new covenant. In this ordinance Christ ratifies his promises to his people, and they on their part solemnly consecrate themselves to him and to his entire service. (3.) To be a badge of the Christian profession. (4.) To indicate and to promote the communion of believers with Christ. (5.) To represent the mutual communion of believers with each other.</description>
    <description>The elements used to represent Christ's body and blood are bread and wine. The kind of bread, whether leavened or unleavened, is not specified. Christ used unleavened bread simply because it was at that moment on the paschal table. Wine, and no other liquid, is to be used (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 26:26-29</reflink>). Believers "feed" on Christ's body and blood, (1) not with the mouth in any manner, but (2) by the soul alone, and (3) by faith, which is the mouth or hand of the soul. This they do (4) by the power of the Holy Ghost. This "feeding" on Christ, however, takes place not in the Lord's Supper alone, but whenever faith in him is exercised.</description>
    <description>This is a permanent ordinance in the Church of Christ, and is to be observed "till he come" again.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Lot">
    <description>(Heb. goral, a "pebble"), a small stone used in casting lots (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 33:54; Jonah 1:7</reflink>). The lot was always resorted to by the Hebrews with strictest reference to the interposition of God, and as a method of ascertaining the divine will (<reflink target="XXX">Prov. 16:33</reflink>), and in serious cases of doubt (<reflink target="XXX">Esther 3:7</reflink>). Thus the lot was used at the division of the land of Canaan among the serveral tribes (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 26:55; 34:13</reflink>), at the detection of Achan (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 7:14, 18</reflink>), the election of Saul to be king (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 10:20, 21</reflink>), the distribution of the priestly offices of the temple service (<reflink target="XXX">1 Chr. 24:3, 5, 19; Luke 1:9</reflink>), and over the two goats at the feast of Atonement (<reflink target="XXX">Lev. 16:8</reflink>). Matthias, who was "numbered with the eleven" (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 1:24-26</reflink>), was chosen by lot.</description>
    <description>This word also denotes a portion or an inheritance (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 15:1; Ps. 125:3; Isa. 17:4</reflink>), and a destiny, as assigned by God (<reflink target="XXX">Ps. 16:5; Dan. 12:13</reflink>).</description>
    <description>Lot, (Heb. lot), a covering; veil, the son of Haran, and nephew of Abraham (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 11:27</reflink>). On the death of his father, he was left in charge of his grandfather Terah (31), after whose death he accompanied his uncle Abraham into Canaan (12:5), thence into Egypt (10), and back again to Canaan (13:1). After this he separated from him and settled in Sodom (13:5-13). There his righteous soul was "vexed" from day to day (<reflink target="XXX">2 Pet. 2:7</reflink>), and he had great cause to regret this act. Not many years after the separation he was taken captive by Chedorlaomer, and was rescued by Abraham (Gen. 14). At length, when the judgment of God descended on the guilty cities of the plain (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 19:1-20</reflink>), Lot was miraculously delivered. When fleeing from the doomed city his wife "looked back from behind him, and became a pillar of salt." There is to this day a peculiar crag at the south end of the Dead Sea, near Kumran, which the Arabs call Bint Sheik Lot, i.e., Lot's wife. It is "a tall, isolated needle of rock, which really does bear a curious resemblance to an Arab woman with a child upon her shoulder." From the words of warning in Luke 17:32, "Remember Lot's wife," it would seem as if she had gone back, or tarried so long behind in the desire to save some of her goods, that she became involved in the destruction which fell on the city, and became a stiffened corpse, fixed for a time in the saline incrustations. She became "a pillar of salt", i.e., as some think, of asphalt. (<see target="x-self">See SALT.</see>)</description>
    <description>Lot and his daughters sought refuge first in Zoar, and then, fearing to remain there longer, retired to a cave in the neighbouring mountains (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 19:30</reflink>). Lot has recently been connected with the people called on the Egyptian monuments Rotanu or Lotanu, who is supposed to have been the hero of the Edomite tribe Lotan.</description>

  <item id="Love">
    <description>This word seems to require explanation only in the case of its use by our Lord in his interview with "Simon, the son of Jonas," after his resurrection (<reflink target="XXX">John 21:16, 17</reflink>). When our Lord says, "Lovest thou me?" he uses the Greek word _agapas_; and when Simon answers, he uses the Greek word _philo_, i.e., "I love." This is the usage in the first and second questions put by our Lord; but in the third our Lord uses Simon's word. The distinction between these two Greek words is thus fitly described by Trench:, "_Agapan_ has more of judgment and deliberate choice; _philein_ has more of attachment and peculiar personal affection. Thus the 'Lovest thou' (Gr. agapas) on the lips of the Lord seems to Peter at this moment too cold a word, as though his Lord were keeping him at a distance, or at least not inviting him to draw near, as in the passionate yearning of his heart he desired now to do. Therefore he puts by the word and substitutes his own stronger 'I love' (Gr. philo) in its room. A second time he does the same. And now he has conquered; for when the Lord demands a third time whether he loves him, he does it in the word which alone will satisfy Peter ('Lovest thou,' Gr. phileis), which alone claims from him that personal attachment and affection with which indeed he knows that his heart is full."</description>

  <item id="Luke">
    <description>the evangelist, was a Gentile. The date and circumstances of his conversion are unknown. According to his own statement (<reflink target="XXX">Luke 1:2</reflink>), he was not an "eye-witness and minister of the word from the beginning." It is probable that he was a physician in Troas, and was there converted by Paul, to whom he attached himself. He accompanied him to Philippi, but did not there share his imprisonment, nor did he accompany him further after his release in his missionary journey at this time (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 17:1</reflink>). On Paul's third visit to Philippi (20:5, 6) we again meet with Luke, who probably had spent all the intervening time in that city, a period of seven or eight years. From this time Luke was Paul's constant companion during his journey to Jerusalem (20:6-21:18). He again disappears from view during Paul's imprisonment at Jerusalem and Caesarea, and only reappears when Paul sets out for Rome (27:1), whither he accompanies him (28:2, 12-16), and where he remains with him till the close of his first imprisonment (<reflink target="XXX">Philemon 1:24; Col. 4:14</reflink>). The last notice of the "beloved physician" is in 2 Tim. 4:11.</description>
    <description>There are many passages in Paul's epistles, as well as in the writings of Luke, which show the extent and accuracy of his medical knowledge.</description>

  <item id="Luke, Gospel according to">
    <description>was written by Luke. He does not claim to have been an eye-witness of our Lord's ministry, but to have gone to the best sources of information within his reach, and to have written an orderly narrative of the facts (<reflink target="XXX">Luke 1:1-4</reflink>). The authors of the first three Gospels, the synoptics, wrote independently of each other. Each wrote his independent narrative under the guidance of the Holy Spirit.</description>
    <description>Each writer has some things, both in matter and style, peculiar to himself, yet all the three have much in common. Luke's Gospel has been called "the Gospel of the nations, full of mercy and hope, assured to the world by the love of a suffering Saviour;" "the Gospel of the saintly life;" "the Gospel for the Greeks; the Gospel of the future; the Gospel of progressive Christianity, of the universality and gratuitousness of the gospel; the historic Gospel; the Gospel of Jesus as the good Physician and the Saviour of mankind;" the "Gospel of the Fatherhood of God and the brotherhood of man;" "the Gospel of womanhood;" "the Gospel of the outcast, of the Samaritan, the publican, the harlot, and the prodigal;" "the Gospel of tolerance." The main characteristic of this Gospel, as Farrar (Cambridge Bible, Luke, Introd.) remarks, is fitly expressed in the motto, "Who went about doing good, and healing all that were oppressed of the devil" (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 10:38; comp. Luke 4:18</reflink>). Luke wrote for the "Hellenic world." This Gospel is indeed "rich and precious."</description>
    <description>"Out of a total of 1151 verses, Luke has 389 in common with Matthew and Mark, 176 in common with Matthew alone, 41 in common with Mark alone, leaving 544 peculiar to himself. In many instances all three use identical language." (<see target="x-self">See MATTHEW ; MARK; GOSPELS.</see>)</description>
    <description>There are seventeen of our Lord's parables peculiar to this Gospel. (<see target="x-self">See List of Parables in Appendix.</see>) Luke also records seven of our Lord's miracles which are omitted by Matthew and Mark. (<see target="x-self">See List of Miracles in Appendix.</see>) The synoptical Gospels are related to each other after the following scheme. If the contents of each Gospel be represented by 100, then when compared this result is obtained:</description>
    <description>Mark has 7 peculiarities, 93 coincidences. Matthew 42 peculiarities, 58 coincidences. Luke 59 peculiarities, 41 coincidences.</description>
    <description>That is, thirteen-fourteenths of Mark, four-sevenths of Matthew, and two-fifths of Luke are taken up in describing the same things in very similar language.</description>
    <description>Luke's style is more finished and classical than that of Matthew and Mark. There is less in it of the Hebrew idiom. He uses a few Latin words (<reflink target="XXX">Luke 12:6; 7:41; 8:30; 11:33; 19:20</reflink>), but no Syriac or Hebrew words except sikera, an exciting drink of the nature of wine, but not made of grapes (from Heb. shakar, "he is intoxicated", Lev. 10:9), probably palm wine.</description>
    <description>This Gospel contains twenty-eight distinct references to the Old Testament.</description>
    <description>The date of its composition is uncertain. It must have been written before the Acts, the date of the composition of which is generally fixed at about 63 or 64 A.D. This Gospel was written, therefore, probably about 60 or 63, when Luke may have been at Caesarea in attendance on Paul, who was then a prisoner. Others have conjectured that it was written at Rome during Paul's imprisonment there. But on this point no positive certainty can be attained.</description>
    <description>It is commonly supposed that Luke wrote under the direction, if not at the dictation of Paul. Many words and phrases are common to both; e.g., compare:</description>
    <description>Luke 4:22; with Col. 4:6. Luke 4:32; with 1 Cor. 2:4. Luke 6:36; with 2 Cor. 1:3. Luke 6:39; with Rom. 2:19. Luke 9:56; with 2 Cor. 10:8. Luke 10:8; with 1 Cor. 10:27. Luke 11:41; with Titus 1:15. Luke 18:1; with 2 Thess. 1:11. Luke 21:36; with Eph. 6:18. Luke 22:19, 20; with  1 Cor. 11:23-29. Luke 24:46; with Acts 17:3. Luke 24:34; with 1 Cor. 15:5.</description>

  <item id="Lycaonia">
    <description>an inland province of Asia Minor, on the west of Cappadocia and the south of Galatia. It was a Roman province, and its chief towns were Iconium, Lystra, and Derbe. The "speech of Lycaonia" (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 14:11</reflink>) was probably the ancient Assyrian language, or perhaps, as others think, a corrupt Greek intermingled with Syriac words. Paul preached in this region, and revisited it (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 16:1-6; 18:23; 19:1</reflink>).</description>

  <item id="Lycia">
    <description>a wolf, a province in the south-west of Asia Minor, opposite the island of Rhodes. It forms part of the region now called Tekeh. It was a province of the Roman empire when visited by Paul (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 21:1; 27:5</reflink>). Two of its towns are mentioned, Patara (21:1, 2) and Myra (27:5).</description>

It lay about 9 miles east of Joppa, on the road from the sea-port to Jerusalem. In the Old Testament (<reflink target="XXX">1 Chr. 8:12</reflink>) it is called Lod. It was burned by the Romans, but was afterwards rebuilt, and was known by the name of Diospolis. Its modern name is Ludd. The so-called patron saint of England, St. George, is said to have been born here.</description>

  <item id="Lydia">
    <description>(1.) Ezek. 30:5 (Heb. Lud), a province in the west of Asia Minor, which derived its name from the fourth son of Shem (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 10:22</reflink>). It was bounded on the east by the greater Phrygia, and on the west by Ionia and the AEgean Sea.</description>
    <description>(2.) A woman of Thyatira, a "seller of purple," who dwelt in Philippi (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 16:14, 15</reflink>). She was not a Jewess but a proselyte. The Lord opened her heart as she heard the gospel from the lips of Paul (16:13). She thus became the first in Europe who embraced Christianity. She was a person apparently of considerable wealth, for she could afford to give a home to Paul and his companions. (<see target="x-self">See THYATIRA.</see>)</description>

  <item id="Lystra">
    <description>a town of Lycaonia, in Asia Minor, in a wild district and among a rude population. Here Paul preached the gospel after he had been driven by persecution from Iconium (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 14:2-7</reflink>). Here also he healed a lame man (8), and thus so impressed the ignorant and superstitious people that they took him for Mercury, because he was the "chief speaker," and his companion Barnabas for Jupiter, probably in consequence of his stately, venerable appearance; and were proceeding to offer sacrifices to them (13), when Paul earnestly addressed them and turned their attention to the true source of all blessings. But soon after, through the influence of the Jews from Antioch in Pisidia and Iconium, they stoned Paul and left him for dead (14:19). On recovering, Paul left for Derbe; but soon returned again, through Lystra, encouraging the disciples there to steadfastness. He in all likelihood visited this city again on his third missionary tour (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 18:23</reflink>). Timothy, who was probably born here (<reflink target="XXX">2 Tim. 3:10, 11</reflink>), was no doubt one of those who were on this occasion witnesses of Paul's persecution and his courage in Lystra.</description>

  <item id="Maccabees">
    <description>This word does not occur in Scripture. It was the name given to the leaders of the national party among the Jews who suffered in the persecution under Antiochus Epiphanes, who succeeded to the Syrian throne B.C. 175. It is supposed to have been derived from the Hebrew word (makkabah) meaning "hammer," as suggestive of the heroism and power of this Jewish family, who are, however, more properly called Asmoneans or Hasmonaeans, the origin of which is much disputed.</description>
    <description>After the expulsion of Antiochus Epiphanes from Egypt by the Romans, he gave vent to his indignation on the Jews, great numbers of whom he mercilessly put to death in Jerusalem. He oppressed them in every way, and tried to abolish altogether the Jewish worship. Mattathias, an aged priest, then residing at Modin, a city to the west of Jerusalem, became now the courageous leader of the national party; and having fled to the mountains, rallied round him a large band of men prepared to fight and die for their country and for their religion, which was now violently suppressed. In 1 Macc. 2:60 is recorded his dying counsels to his sons with reference to the war they were now to carry on. His son Judas, "the Maccabee," succeeded him (B.C. 166) as the leader in directing the war of independence, which was carried on with great heroism on the part of the Jews, and was terminated in the defeat of the Syrians.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Maccabees, Books of the">
    <description>There were originally five books of the Maccabees. The first contains a history of the war of independence, commencing (B.C. 175) in a series of patriotic struggles against the tyranny of Antiochus Epiphanes, and terminating B.C. 135. It became part of the Vulgate Version of the Bible, and was thus retained among the Apocrypha.</description>
    <description>The second gives a history of the Maccabees' struggle from B.C. 176 to B.C. 161. Its object is to encourage and admonish the Jews to be faithful to the religion of their fathers.</description>
    <description>The third does not hold a place in the Apocrypha, but is read in the Greek Church. Its design is to comfort the Alexandrian Jews in their persecution. Its writer was evidently an Alexandrian Jew.</description>
    <description>The fourth was found in the Library of Lyons, but was afterwards burned. The fifth contains a history of the Jews from B.C. 184 to B.C. 86. It is a compilation made by a Jew after the destruction of Jerusalem, from ancient memoirs, to which he had access. It need scarcely be added that none of these books has any divine authority.</description>

  <item id="Macedonia">
    <description>in New Testament times, was a Roman province lying north of Greece. It was governed by a propraetor with the title of proconsul. Paul was summoned by the vision of the "man of Macedonia" to preach the gospel there (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 16:9</reflink>). Frequent allusion is made to this event (18:5; 19:21; Rom. 15:26; 2 Cor. 1:16; 11:9; Phil. 4:15). The history of Paul's first journey through Macedonia is given in detail in Acts 16:10-17:15. At the close of this journey he returned from Corinth to Syria. He again passed through this country (20:1-6), although the details of the route are not given. After many years he probably visited it for a third time (<reflink target="XXX">Phil. 2:24; 1 Tim. 1:3</reflink>). The first convert made by Paul in Europe was (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 16:13-15</reflink>) Lydia (q.v.), a "seller of purple," residing in Philippi, the chief city of the eastern division of Macedonia.</description>

  <item id="Machaerus">
    <description>the Black Fortress, was built by Herod the Great in the gorge of Callirhoe, one of the wadies 9 miles east of the Dead Sea, as a frontier rampart against Arab marauders. John the Baptist was probably cast into the prison connected with this castle by Herod Antipas, whom he had reproved for his adulterous marriage with Herodias. Here Herod "made a supper" on his birthday. He was at this time marching against Aretas, king of Perea, to whose daughter he had been married. During the revelry of the banquet held in the border fortress, to please Salome, who danced before him, he sent an executioner, who beheaded John, and "brought his head in a charger, and gave it to the damsel" (<reflink target="XXX">Mark 6:14-29</reflink>). This castle stood "starkly bold and clear" 3,860 feet above the Dead Sea, and 2,546 above the Mediterranean. Its ruins, now called M'khaur, are still visible on the northern end of Jebel Attarus.</description>

  <item id="Machpelah">
    <description>portion; double cave, the cave which Abraham bought, together with the field in which it stood, from Ephron the Hittite, for a family burying-place (Gen. 23). It is one of those Bible localities about the identification of which there can be no doubt. It was on the slope of a hill on the east of Hebron, "before Mamre." Here were laid the bodies of Abraham and Sarah, Isaac and Rebekah, Jacob and Leah (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 23:19; 25:9; 49:31; 50:13</reflink>). Over the cave an ancient Christian church was erected, probably in the time of Justinian, the Roman emperor. This church has been converted into a Mohammedan mosque. The whole is surrounded by the el-Haram i.e., "the sacred enclosure," about 200 feet long, 115 broad, and of an average height of about 50. This building, from the immense size of some of its stones, and the manner in which they are fitted together, is supposed by some to have been erected in the days of David or of Solomon, while others ascribe it to the time of Herod. It is looked upon as the most ancient and finest relic of Jewish architecture.</description>
    <description>On the floor of the mosque are erected six large cenotaphs as monuments to the dead who are buried in the cave beneath. Between the cenotaphs of Isaac and Rebekah there is a circular opening in the floor into the cavern below, the cave of Machpelah. Here it may be that the body of Jacob, which was embalmed in Egypt, is still preserved (much older embalmed bodies have recently been found in the cave of Deir el-Bahari in Egypt, see PHARAOH), though those of the others there buried may have long ago mouldered into dust. The interior of the mosque was visited by the Prince of Wales in 1862 by a special favour of the Mohammedan authorities. An interesting account of this visit is given in Dean Stanley's Lectures on the Jewish Church. It was also visited in 1866 by the Marquis of Bute, and in 1869 by the late Emperor (Frederick) of Germany, then the Crown Prince of Prussia. In 1881 it was visited by the two sons of the Prince of Wales, accompanied by Sir C. Wilson and others. (<see target="x-self">See Palestine Quarterly Statement, October 1882</see>).</description>

It was on the west shore of the Lake of Tiberias, and is now probably the small obscure village called el-Mejdel, about 3 miles north-west of Tiberias. In the Talmud this city is called "the city of colour," and a particular district of it was called "the tower of dyers." The indigo plant was much cultivated here.</description>

  <item id="Magdalene">
    <description>a surname derived from Magdala, the place of her nativity, given to one of the Marys of the Gospels to distinguish her from the other Marys (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 27:56, 61; 28:1, etc.</reflink>). A mistaken notion has prevailed that this Mary was a woman of bad character, that she was the woman who is emphatically called "a sinner" (<reflink target="XXX">Luke 7:36-50</reflink>). (<see target="x-self">See MARY.</see>)</description>

  <item id="Magic">
    <description>The Jews seem early to have consulted the teraphim (q.v.) for oracular answers (<reflink target="XXX">Judg. 18:5, 6; Zech. 10:2</reflink>). There is a remarkable illustration of this divining by teraphim in Ezek. 21:19-22. We read also of the divining cup of Joseph (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 44:5</reflink>). The magicians of Egypt are frequently referred to in the history of the Exodus. Magic was an inherent part of the ancient Egyptian religion, and entered largely into their daily life.</description>
    <description>All magical arts were distinctly prohibited under penalty of death in the Mosaic law. The Jews were commanded not to learn the "abomination" of the people of the Promised Land (<reflink target="XXX">Lev. 19:31; Deut. 18:9-14</reflink>). The history of Saul's consulting the witch of Endor (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 28:3-20</reflink>) gives no warrant for attributing supernatural power to magicians. From the first the witch is here only a bystander. The practice of magic lingered among the people till after the Captivity, when they gradually abandoned it.</description>
    <description>It is not much referred to in the New Testament. The Magi mentioned in Matt. 2:1-12 were not magicians in the ordinary sense of the word. They belonged to a religious caste, the followers of Zoroaster, the astrologers of the East. Simon, a magician, was found by Philip at Samaria (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 8:9-24</reflink>); and Paul and Barnabas encountered Elymas, a Jewish sorcerer, at Paphos (13:6-12). At Ephesus there was a great destruction of magical books (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 19:18, 19</reflink>).</description>

  <item id="Magistrate">
    <description>a public civil officer invested with authority. The Hebrew shophetim, or judges, were magistrates having authority in the land (<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 1:16, 17</reflink>). In Judg. 18:7 the word "magistrate" (A.V.) is rendered in the Revised Version "possessing authority", i.e., having power to do them harm by invasion. In the time of Ezra (9:2) and Nehemiah (2:16; 4:14; 13:11) the Jewish magistrates were called _seganim_, properly meaning "nobles." In the New Testament the Greek word _archon_, rendered "magistrate" (<reflink target="XXX">Luke 12:58; Titus 3:1</reflink>), means one first in power, and hence a prince, as in Matt. 20:25, 1 Cor. 2:6, 8. This term is used of the Messiah, "Prince of the kings of the earth" (<reflink target="XXX">Rev. 1:5</reflink>). In Acts 16:20, 22, 35, 36, 38, the Greek term _strategos_, rendered "magistrate," properly signifies the leader of an army, a general, one having military authority. The _strategoi_ were the duumviri, the two praetors appointed to preside over the administration of justice in the colonies of the Romans. They were attended by the sergeants (properly lictors or "rod bearers").</description>

  <item id="Magog">
    <description>region of Gog, the second of the "sons" of Japheth (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 10:2; 1 Chr. 1:5</reflink>). In Ezekiel (38:2; 39:6) it is the name of a nation, probably some Scythian or Tartar tribe descended from Japheth. They are described as skilled horsemen, and expert in the use of the bow. The Latin father Jerome says that this word denotes "Scythian nations, fierce and innumerable, who live beyond the Caucasus and the Lake Maeotis, and near the Caspian Sea, and spread out even onward to India." Perhaps the name "represents the Assyrian Mat Gugi, or 'country of Gugu,' the Gyges of the Greeks" (Sayce's Races, etc.).</description>

    <description>This word leannoth seems to point to some kind of instrument unknown (Ps. 88, title). The whole phrase has by others been rendered, "On the sickness of affliction: a lesson;" or, "Concerning afflictive sickness: a didactic psalm."</description>

  <item id="Mahalath Maschil">
    <description>in the title of Ps. 53, denoting that this was a didactic psalm, to be sung to the accompaniment of the lute or guitar. Others regard this word "mahalath" as the name simply of an old air to which the psalm was to be sung. Others, again, take the word as meaning "sickness," and regard it as alluding to the contents of the psalm.</description>

  <item id="Mahanaim">
    <description>two camps, a place near the Jabbok, beyond Jordan, where Jacob was met by the "angels of God," and where he divided his retinue into "two hosts" on his return from Padan-aram (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 32:2</reflink>). This name was afterwards given to the town which was built at that place. It was the southern boundary of Bashan (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 13:26, 30</reflink>), and became a city of the Levites (21:38). Here Saul's son Ishbosheth reigned (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 2:8, 12</reflink>), while David reigned at Hebron. Here also, after a troubled reign, Ishbosheth was murdered by two of his own bodyguard (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 4:5-7</reflink>), who brought his head to David at Hebron, but were, instead of being rewarded, put to death by him for their cold-blooded murder. Many years after this, when he fled from Jerusalem on the rebellion of his son Absalom, David made Mahanaim, where Barzillai entertained him, his headquarters, and here he mustered his forces which were led against the army that had gathered around Absalom. It was while sitting at the gate of this town that tidings of the great and decisive battle between the two hosts and of the death of his son Absalom reached him, when he gave way to the most violent grief (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 17:24-27</reflink>).</description>
    <description>The only other reference to Mahanaim is as a station of one of Solomon's purveyors (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 4:14</reflink>). It has been identified with the modern Mukhumah, a ruin found in a depressed plain called el-Bukie'a, "the little vale," near Penuel, south of the Jabbok, and north-east of es-Salt.</description>

They were put to death by Joshua, who afterwards suspended their bodies upon five trees. It has been identified with the modern village called Sumeil, standing on a low hill about 7 miles to the north-west of Eleutheropolis (Beit Jibrin), where are ancient remains and a great cave. The Palestine Exploration surveyors have, however, identified it with el-Mughar, or "the caves," 3 miles from Jabneh and 2 1/2 southwest of Ekron, because, they say, "at this site only of all possible sites for Makkedah in the Palestine plain do caves still exist."

  <item id="Malachi">
    <description>messenger or angel, the last of the minor prophets, and the writer of the last book of the Old Testament canon (<reflink target="XXX">Mal. 4:4, 5, 6</reflink>). Nothing is known of him beyond what is contained in his book of prophecies. Some have supposed that the name is simply a title descriptive of his character as a messenger of Jehovah, and not a proper name. There is reason, however, to conclude that Malachi was the ordinary name of the prophet.</description>
    <description>He was contemporary with Nehemiah (<reflink target="XXX">comp. Mal. 2:8 with Neh. 13:15; Mal. 2:10-16 with Neh. 13:23</reflink>). No allusion is made to him by Ezra, and he does not mention the restoration of the temple, and hence it is inferred that he prophesied after Haggai and Zechariah, and when the temple services were still in existence (<reflink target="XXX">Mal. 1:10; 3:1, 10</reflink>). It is probable that he delivered his prophecies about B.C. 420, after the second return of Nehemiah from Persia (<reflink target="XXX">Neh. 13:6</reflink>), or possibly before his return.</description>

  <item id="Malachi, Prophecies of">
    <description>The contents of the book are comprised in four chapters. In the Hebrew text the third and fourth chapters (of the A.V.) form but one. The whole consists of three sections, preceded by an introduction (<reflink target="XXX">Mal. 1:1-5</reflink>), in which the prophet reminds Israel of Jehovah's love to them. The first section (1:6-2:9) contains a stern rebuke addressed to the priests who had despised the name of Jehovah, and been leaders in a departure from his worship and from the covenant, and for their partiality in administering the law. In the second (2:9-16) the people are rebuked for their intermarriages with idolatrous heathen. In the third (2:17-4:6) he addresses the people as a whole, and warns them of the coming of the God of judgment, preceded by the advent of the Messiah.</description>
    <description>This book is frequently referred to in the New Testament (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 11:10; 17:12; Mark 1:2; 9:11, 12; Luke 1:17; Rom. 9:13</reflink>).</description>

    <description>(2.) The name of the place in the neighbourhood of Hebron (q.v.) where Abraham dwelt (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 23:17, 19; 35:27</reflink>); called also in Authorized Version (13:18) the "plain of Mamre," but in Revised Version more correctly "the oaks [marg., 'terebinths'] of Mamre." The name probably denotes the "oak grove" or the "wood of Mamre," thus designated after Abraham's ally.</description>
    <description>This "grove" must have been within sight of or "facing" Machpelah (q.v.). The site of Mamre has been identified with Ballatet Selta, i.e., "the oak of rest", where there is a tree called "Abraham's oak," about a mile and a half west of Hebron. Others identify it with er-Rameh, 2 miles north of Hebron.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Man">
    <description>(1.) Heb. 'Adam, used as the proper name of the first man. The name is derived from a word meaning "to be red," and thus the first man was called Adam because he was formed from the red earth. It is also the generic name of the human race (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 1:26, 27; 5:2; 8:21; Deut. 8:3</reflink>). Its equivalents are the Latin homo and the Greek anthropos (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 5:13, 16</reflink>). It denotes also man in opposition to woman (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 3:12; Matt. 19:10</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(2.) Heb. 'ish, like the Latin vir and Greek aner, denotes properly a man in opposition to a woman (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 17:33; Matt. 14:21</reflink>); a husband (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 3:16; Hos. 2:16</reflink>); man with reference to excellent mental qualities.</description>

    <description>Man was created by the immediate hand of God, and is generically different from all other creatures (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 1:26, 27; 2:7</reflink>). His complex nature is composed of two elements, two distinct substances, viz., body and soul (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 2:7; Eccl. 12:7; 2 Cor. 5:1-8</reflink>).</description>
    <description>The words translated "spirit" and "soul," in 1 Thess. 5:23, Heb. 4:12, are habitually used interchangeably (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 10:28; 16:26; 1 Pet. 1:22</reflink>). The "spirit" (Gr. pneuma) is the soul as rational; the "soul" (Gr. psuche) is the same, considered as the animating and vital principle of the body.</description>
    <description>Man was created in the likeness of God as to the perfection of his nature, in knowledge (<reflink target="XXX">Col. 3:10</reflink>), righteousness, and holiness (<reflink target="XXX">Eph. 4:24</reflink>), and as having dominion over all the inferior creatures (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 1:28</reflink>). He had in his original state God's law written on his heart, and had power to obey it, and yet was capable of disobeying, being left to the freedom of his own will. He was created with holy dispositions, prompting him to holy actions; but he was fallible, and did fall from his integrity (3:1-6). (<see target="x-self">See FALL.</see>)</description>

  <item id="Man of sin">
    <description>a designation of Antichrist given in 2 Thess. 2:3-10, usually regarded as descriptive of the Papal power; but "in whomsoever these distinctive features are found, whoever wields temporal and spiritual power in any degree similar to that in which the man of sin is here described as wielding it, he, be he pope or potentate, is beyond all doubt a distinct type of Antichrist."</description>

  <item id="Manaen">
    <description>consoler, a Christian teacher at Antioch. Nothing else is known of him beyond what is stated in Acts 13:1, where he is spoken of as having been brought up with (Gr. syntrophos; rendered in R.V. "foster brother" of) Herod, i.e., Herod Antipas, the tetrach, who, with his brother Archelaus, was educated at Rome.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Manasseh">
    <description>who makes to forget. "God hath made me forget" (Heb. nashshani), Gen. 41:51. (1.) The elder of the two sons of Joseph. He and his brother Ephraim were afterwards adopted by Jacob as his own sons (48:1). There is an account of his marriage to a Syrian (<reflink target="XXX">1 Chr. 7:14</reflink>); and the only thing afterwards recorded of him is, that his grandchildren were "brought up upon Joseph's knees" (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 50:23; R.V., "born upon Joseph's knees"</reflink>) i.e., were from their birth adopted by Joseph as his own children.</description>
    <description>The tribe of Manasseh was associated with that of Ephraim and Benjamin during the wanderings in the wilderness. They encamped on the west side of the tabernacle. According to the census taken at Sinai, this tribe then numbered 32,200 (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 1:10, 35; 2:20, 21</reflink>). Forty years afterwards its numbers had increased to 52,700 (26:34, 37), and it was at this time the most distinguished of all the tribes.</description>
    <description>The half of this tribe, along with Reuben and Gad, had their territory assigned them by Moses on the east of the Jordan (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 13:7-14</reflink>); but it was left for Joshua to define the limits of each tribe. This territory on the east of Jordan was more valuable and of larger extent than all that was allotted to the nine and a half tribes in the land of Palestine. It is sometimes called "the land of Gilead," and is also spoken of as "on the other side of Jordan." The portion given to the half tribe of Manasseh was the largest on the east of Jordan. It embraced the whole of Bashan. It was bounded on the south by Mahanaim, and extended north to the foot of Lebanon. Argob, with its sixty cities, that "ocean of basaltic rocks and boulders tossed about in the wildest confusion," lay in the midst of this territory.</description>
    <description>The whole "land of Gilead" having been conquered, the two and a half tribes left their wives and families in the fortified cities there, and accompanied the other tribes across the Jordan, and took part with them in the wars of conquest. The allotment of the land having been completed, Joshua dismissed the two and a half tribes, commending them for their heroic service (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 22:1-34</reflink>). Thus dismissed, they returned over Jordan to their own inheritance. (<see target="x-self">See ED.</see>)</description>
    <description>On the west of Jordan the other half of the tribe of Manasseh was associated with Ephraim, and they had their portion in the very centre of Palestine, an area of about 1,300 square miles, the most valuable part of the whole country, abounding in springs of water. Manasseh's portion was immediately to the north of that of Ephraim (Josh. 16). Thus the western Manasseh defended the passes of Esdraelon as the eastern kept the passes of the Hauran.</description>
    <description>(2.) The only son and successor of Hezekiah on the throne of Judah. He was twelve years old when he began to reign (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 21:1</reflink>), and he reigned fifty-five years (B.C. 698-643). Though he reigned so long, yet comparatively little is known of this king. His reign was a continuation of that of Ahaz, both in religion and national polity. He early fell under the influence of the heathen court circle, and his reign was characterized by a sad relapse into idolatry with all its vices, showing that the reformation under his father had been to a large extent only superficial (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 7:10; 2 Kings 21:10-15</reflink>). A systematic and persistent attempt was made, and all too successfully, to banish the worship of Jehovah out of the land. Amid this wide-spread idolatry there were not wanting, however, faithful prophets (Isaiah, Micah) who lifted up their voice in reproof and in warning. But their fidelity only aroused bitter hatred, and a period of cruel persecution against all the friends of the old religion began. "The days of Alva in Holland, of Charles IX. in France, or of the Covenanters under Charles II. in Scotland, were anticipated in the Jewish capital. The streets were red with blood." There is an old Jewish tradition that Isaiah was put to death at this time (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 21:16; 24:3, 4; Jer. 2:30</reflink>), having been sawn asunder in the trunk of a tree. Psalms 49, 73, 77, 140, and 141 seem to express the feelings of the pious amid the fiery trials of this great persecution. Manasseh has been called the "Nero of Palestine."</description>
    <description>Esarhaddon, Sennacherib's successor on the Assyrian throne, who had his residence in Babylon for thirteen years (the only Assyrian monarch who ever reigned in Babylon), took Manasseh prisoner (B.C. 681) to Babylon. Such captive kings were usually treated with great cruelty. They were brought before the conqueror with a hook or ring passed through their lips or their jaws, having a cord attached to it, by which they were led. This is referred to in 2 Chr. 33:11, where the Authorized Version reads that Esarhaddon "took Manasseh among the thorns;" while the Revised Version renders the words, "took Manasseh in chains;" or literally, as in the margin, "with hooks." (Comp. 2 Kings 19:28.)</description>
    <description>The severity of Manasseh's imprisonment brought him to repentance. God heard his cry, and he was restored to his kingdom (<reflink target="XXX">2 Chr. 33:11-13</reflink>). He abandoned his idolatrous ways, and enjoined the people to worship Jehovah; but there was no thorough reformation. After a lengthened reign extending through fifty-five years, the longest in the history of Judah, he died, and was buried in the garden of Uzza, the "garden of his own house" (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 21:17, 18; 2 Chr. 33:20</reflink>), and not in the city of David, among his ancestors. He was succeeded by his son Amon.</description>
    <description>In Judg. 18:30 the correct reading is "Moses," and not "Manasseh." The name "Manasseh" is supposed to have been introduced by some transcriber to avoid the scandal of naming the grandson of Moses the great lawgiver as the founder of an idolatrous religion.</description>

  <item id="Mandrakes">
    <description>Hebrew dudaim; i.e., "love-plants", occurs only in Gen. 30:14-16 and Cant. 7:13. Many interpretations have been given of this word _dudaim_. It has been rendered "violets," "Lilies," "jasmines," "truffles or mushrooms," "flowers," the "citron," etc. The weight of authority is in favour of its being regarded as the Mandragora officinalis of botanists, "a near relative of the night-shades, the 'apple of Sodom' and the potato plant." It possesses stimulating and narcotic properties (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 30:14-16</reflink>). The fruit of this plant resembles the potato-apple in size, and is of a pale orange colour. It has been called the "love-apple." The Arabs call it "Satan's apple." It still grows near Jerusalem, and in other parts of Palestine.</description>

It seems to have been a stall or crib for feeding cattle. Stables and mangers in our modern sense were in ancient times unknown in the East. The word here properly denotes "the ledge or projection in the end of the room used as a stall on which the hay or other food of the animals of travellers was placed."

  <item id="Manna">
    <description>Heb. man-hu, "What is that?" the name given by the Israelites to the food miraculously supplied to them during their wanderings in the wilderness (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 16:15-35</reflink>). The name is commonly taken as derived from _man_, an expression of surprise, "What is it?" but more probably it is derived from _manan_, meaning "to allot," and hence denoting an "allotment" or a "gift." This "gift" from God is described as "a small round thing," like the "hoar-frost on the ground," and "like coriander seed," "of the colour of bdellium," and in taste "like wafers made with honey." It was capable of being baked and boiled, ground in mills, or beaten in a mortar (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 16:23; Num. 11:7</reflink>). If any was kept over till the following morning, it became corrupt with worms; but as on the Sabbath none fell, on the preceding day a double portion was given, and that could be kept over to supply the wants of the Sabbath without becoming corrupt. Directions concerning the gathering of it are fully given (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 16:16-18, 33; Deut. 8:3, 16</reflink>). It fell for the first time after the eighth encampment in the desert of Sin, and was daily furnished, except on the Sabbath, for all the years of the wanderings, till they encamped at Gilgal, after crossing the Jordan, when it suddenly ceased, and where they "did eat of the old corn of the land; neither had the children of Israel manna any more" (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 5:12</reflink>). They now no longer needed the "bread of the wilderness."</description>
    <description>This manna was evidently altogether a miraculous gift, wholly different from any natural product with which we are acquainted, and which bears this name. The manna of European commerce comes chiefly from Calabria and Sicily. It drops from the twigs of a species of ash during the months of June and July. At night it is fluid and resembles dew, but in the morning it begins to harden. The manna of the Sinaitic peninsula is an exudation from the "manna-tamarisk" tree (Tamarix mannifera), the el-tarfah of the Arabs. This tree is found at the present day in certain well-watered valleys in the peninsula of Sinai. The manna with which the people of Israel were fed for forty years differs in many particulars from all these natural products.</description>
    <description>Our Lord refers to the manna when he calls himself the "true bread from heaven" (<reflink target="XXX">John 6:31-35; 48-51</reflink>). He is also the "hidden manna" (<reflink target="XXX">Rev. 2:17; comp. John 6:49,51</reflink>).</description>

    <description>(1.) Heb. 'addereth, a large over-garment. This word is used of Elijah's mantle (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 19:13, 19; 2 Kings 2:8, 13, etc.</reflink>), which was probably a sheepskin. It appears to have been his only garment, a strip of skin or leather binding it to his loins. _'Addereth_ twice occurs with the epithet "hairy" (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 25:25; Zech. 13:4, R.V.</reflink>). It is the word denoting the "goodly Babylonish garment" which Achan coveted (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 7:21</reflink>).</description>

Heb. me'il, frequently applied to the "robe of the ephod" (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 28:4, 31; Lev. 8:7</reflink>), which was a splendid under tunic wholly of blue, reaching to below the knees. It was woven without seam, and was put on by being drawn over the head. It was worn not only by priests but by kings (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 24:4</reflink>), prophets (15:27), and rich men (<reflink target="XXX">Job 1:20; 2:12</reflink>). This was the "little coat" which Samuel's mother brought to him from year to year to Shiloh (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 2:19</reflink>), a miniature of the official priestly robe.</description>
    <description>(3.) Semikah, "a rug," the garment which Jael threw as a covering over Sisera (<reflink target="XXX">Judg. 4:18</reflink>). The Hebrew word occurs nowhere else in Scripture.</description>

On this account they murmured against Moses, who, under divine direction, cast into the fountain "a certain tree" which took away its bitterness, so that the people drank of it. This was probably the 'Ain Hawarah, where there are still several springs of water that are very "bitter," distant some 47 miles from 'Ayun Mousa.</description>

  <item id="Marble">
    <description>as a mineral, consists of carbonate of lime, its texture varying from the highly crystalline to the compact. In Esther 1:6 there are four Hebrew words which are rendered marble:, (1.) Shesh, "pillars of marble." But this word probably designates dark-blue limestone rather than marble. (2.) Dar, some regard as Parian marble. It is here rendered "white marble." But nothing is certainly known of it. (3.) Bahat, "red marble," probably the verd-antique or half-porphyry of Egypt. (4.) Sohareth, "black marble," probably some spotted variety of marble. "The marble pillars and tesserae of various colours of the palace at Susa came doubtless from Persia itself, where marble of various colours is found, especially in the province of Hamadan Susiana." The marble of Solomon's architectural works may have been limestone from near Jerusalem, or from Lebanon, or possibly white marble from Arabia. Herod employed Parian marble in the temple, and marble columns still exist in great abundance at Jerusalem.</description>

  </item>
  <item id="Mark">
    <description>the evangelist; "John whose surname was Mark" (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 12:12, 25</reflink>). Mark (Marcus, Col. 4:10, etc.) was his Roman name, which gradually came to supersede his Jewish name John. He is called John in Acts 13:5, 13, and Mark in 15:39, 2 Tim. 4:11, etc.</description>
    <description>He was the son of Mary, a woman apparently of some means and influence, and was probably born in Jerusalem, where his mother resided (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 12:12</reflink>). Of his father we know nothing. He was cousin of Barnabas (<reflink target="XXX">Col. 4:10</reflink>). It was in his mother's house that Peter found "many gathered together praying" when he was released from prison; and it is probable that it was here that he was converted by Peter, who calls him his "son" (<reflink target="XXX">1 Pet. 5:13</reflink>). It is probable that the "young man" spoken of in Mark 14:51, 52 was Mark himself. He is first mentioned in Acts 12:25. He went with Paul and Barnabas on their first journey (about A.D. 47) as their "minister," but from some cause turned back when they reached Perga in Pamphylia (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 12:25; 13:13</reflink>). Three years afterwards a "sharp contention" arose between Paul and Barnabas (15:36-40), because Paul would not take Mark with him. He, however, was evidently at length reconciled to the apostle, for he was with him in his first imprisonment at Rome (<reflink target="XXX">Col. 4:10; Philemon 1:24</reflink>). At a later period he was with Peter in Babylon (<reflink target="XXX">1 Pet. 5:13</reflink>), then, and for some centuries afterwards, one of the chief seats of Jewish learning; and he was with Timothy in Ephesus when Paul wrote him during his second imprisonment (<reflink target="XXX">2 Tim. 4:11</reflink>). He then disappears from view.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Mark, Gospel according to">
    <description>It is the current and apparently well-founded tradition that Mark derived his information mainly from the discourses of Peter. In his mother's house he would have abundant opportunities of obtaining information from the other apostles and their coadjutors, yet he was "the disciple and interpreter of Peter" specially.</description>
    <description>As to the time when it was written, the Gospel furnishes us with no definite information. Mark makes no mention of the destruction of Jerusalem, hence it must have been written before that event, and probably about A.D. 63.</description>
    <description>The place where it was written was probably Rome. Some have supposed Antioch (<reflink target="XXX">comp. Mark 15:21 with Acts 11:20</reflink>).</description>
    <description>It was intended primarily for Romans. This appears probable when it is considered that it makes no reference to the Jewish law, and that the writer takes care to interpret words which a Gentile would be likely to misunderstand, such as, "Boanerges" (3:17); "Talitha cumi" (5:41); "Corban" (7:11); "Bartimaeus" (10:46); "Abba" (14:36); "Eloi," etc. (15:34). Jewish usages are also explained (7:3; 14:3; 14:12; 15:42). Mark also uses certain Latin words not found in any of the other Gospels, as "speculator" (6:27, rendered, A.V., "executioner;" R.V., "soldier of his guard"), "xestes" (a corruption of sextarius, rendered "pots," 7:4, 8), "quadrans" (12:42, rendered "a farthing"), "centurion" (15:39, 44, 45). He only twice quotes from the Old Testament (1:2; 15:28).</description>
    <description>The characteristics of this Gospel are, (1) the absence of the genealogy of our Lord, (2) whom he represents as clothed with power, the "lion of the tribe of Judah." (3.) Mark also records with wonderful minuteness the very words (3:17; 5:41; 7:11, 34; 14:36) as well as the position (9:35) and gestures (3:5, 34; 5:32; 9:36; 10:16) of our Lord. (4.) He is also careful to record particulars of person (1:29, 36; 3:6, 22, etc.), number (5:13; 6:7, etc.), place (2:13; 4:1; 7:31, etc.), and time (1:35; 2:1; 4:35, etc.), which the other evangelists omit. (5.) The phrase "and straightway" occurs nearly forty times in this Gospel; while in Luke's Gospel, which is much longer, it is used only seven times, and in John only four times.</description>
    <description>"The Gospel of Mark," says Westcott, "is essentially a transcript from life. The course and issue of facts are imaged in it with the clearest outline." "In Mark we have no attempt to draw up a continuous narrative. His Gospel is a rapid succession of vivid pictures loosely strung together without much attempt to bind them into a whole or give the events in their natural sequence. This pictorial power is that which specially characterizes this evangelist, so that 'if any one desires to know an evangelical fact, not only in its main features and grand results, but also in its most minute and so to speak more graphic delineation, he must betake himself to Mark.'" The leading principle running through this Gospel may be expressed in the motto: "Jesus came...preaching the gospel of the kingdom" (<reflink target="XXX">Mark 1:14</reflink>).</description>
    <description>"Out of a total of 662 verses, Mark has 406 in common with Matthew and Luke, 145 with Matthew, 60 with Luke, and at most 51 peculiar to itself." (<see target="x-self">See MATTHEW.</see>)</description>

  <item id="Market-place">
    <description>any place of public resort, and hence a public place or broad street (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 11:16; 20:3</reflink>), as well as a forum or market-place proper, where goods were exposed for sale, and where public assemblies and trials were held (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 16:19; 17:17</reflink>). This word occurs in the Old Testament only in Ezek. 27:13.</description>
    <description>In early times markets were held at the gates of cities, where commodities were exposed for sale (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 7:18</reflink>). In large towns the sale of particular articles seems to have been confined to certain streets, as we may infer from such expressions as "the bakers' street" (<reflink target="XXX">Jer. 37:21</reflink>), and from the circumstance that in the time of Josephus the valley between Mounts Zion and Moriah was called the Tyropoeon or the "valley of the cheesemakers."</description>

  <item id="Marriage">
    <description>was instituted in Paradise when man was in innocence (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 2:18-24</reflink>). Here we have its original charter, which was confirmed by our Lord, as the basis on which all regulations are to be framed (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 19:4, 5</reflink>). It is evident that monogamy was the original law of marriage (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 19:5; 1 Cor. 6:16</reflink>). This law was violated in after times, when corrupt usages began to be introduced (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 4:19; 6:2</reflink>). We meet with the prevalence of polygamy and concubinage in the patriarchal age (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 16:1-4; 22:21-24; 28:8, 9; 29:23-30, etc.</reflink>). Polygamy was acknowledged in the Mosaic law and made the basis of legislation, and continued to be practised all down through the period of Jewish histroy to the Captivity, after which there is no instance of it on record.</description>
    <description>It seems to have been the practice from the beginning for fathers to select wives for their sons (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 24:3; 38:6</reflink>). Sometimes also proposals were initiated by the father of the maiden (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 2:21</reflink>). The brothers of the maiden were also sometimes consulted (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 24:51; 34:11</reflink>), but her own consent was not required. The young man was bound to give a price to the father of the maiden (31:15; 34:12; Ex. 22:16, 17; 1 Sam. 18:23, 25; Ruth 4:10; Hos. 3:2) On these patriarchal customs the Mosaic law made no change.</description>
    <description>In the pre-Mosaic times, when the proposals were accepted and the marriage price given, the bridegroom could come at once and take away his bride to his own house (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 24:63-67</reflink>). But in general the marriage was celebrated by a feast in the house of the bride's parents, to which all friends were invited (29:22, 27); and on the day of the marriage the bride, concealed under a thick veil, was conducted to her future husband's home.</description>
    <description>Our Lord corrected many false notions then existing on the subject of marriage (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 22:23-30</reflink>), and placed it as a divine institution on the highest grounds. The apostles state clearly and enforce the nuptial duties of husband and wife (<reflink target="XXX">Eph. 5:22-33; Col. 3:18, 19; 1 Pet. 3:1-7</reflink>). Marriage is said to be "honourable" (<reflink target="XXX">Heb. 13:4</reflink>), and the prohibition of it is noted as one of the marks of degenerate times (<reflink target="XXX">1 Tim. 4:3</reflink>).</description>
    <description>The marriage relation is used to represent the union between God and his people (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 54:5; Jer. 3:1-14; Hos. 2:9, 20</reflink>). In the New Testament the same figure is employed in representing the love of Christ to his saints (<reflink target="XXX">Eph. 5:25-27</reflink>). The Church of the redeemed is the "Bride, the Lamb's wife" (<reflink target="XXX">Rev. 19:7-9</reflink>).</description>

The guests sit round the great bowl or bowls on the floor, the meal usually consisting of a lamb or kid stewed in rice or barley. The most honoured guests sit nearest, others behind; and all in eating dip their hand into the one smoking mound, pieces of the thin bread, bent together, serving for spoons when necessary. After the first circle have satisfied themselves, those lower in honour sit down to the rest, the whole company being men, for women are never seen at a feast. Water is poured on the hands before eating; and this is repeated when the meal closes, the fingers having first been wiped on pieces of bread, which, after serving the same purpose as table-napkins with us, are thrown on the ground to be eaten by any dog that may have stolen in from the streets through the ever-open door, or picked up by those outside when gathered and tossed out to them (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 15:27; Mark 7:28</reflink>). Rising from the ground and retiring to the seats round the walls, the guests then sit down cross-legged and gossip, or listen to recitals, or puzzle over riddles, light being scantily supplied by a small lamp or two, or if the night be chilly, by a smouldering fire of weeds kindled in the middle of the room, perhaps in a brazier, often in a hole in the floor. As to the smoke, it escapes as it best may; but indeed there is little of it, though enough to blacken the water or wine or milk skins hung up on pegs on the wall. (<reflink target="XXX">Comp.

From the residence being called "her house," some have supposed that she was a widow, and that her brother and sister lodged with her. She seems to have been of an anxious, bustling spirit, anxious to be helpful in providing the best things for the Master's use, in contrast to the quiet earnestness of Mary, who was more concerned to avail herself of the opportunity of sitting at his feet and learning of him. Afterwards at a supper given to Christ and his disciples in her house "Martha served." Nothing further is known of her.</description>
    <description>"Mary and Martha are representatives of two orders of human character. One was absorbed, preoccupied, abstracted; the other was concentrated and single-hearted. Her own world was the all of Martha; Christ was the first thought with Mary. To Martha life was 'a succession of particular businesses;' to Mary life 'was rather the flow of one spirit.' Martha was Petrine, Mary was Johannine. The one was a well-meaning, bustling busybody; the other was a reverent disciple, a wistful listener."

    <description>While she resided at Nazareth with her parents, before she became the wife of Joseph, the angel Gabriel announced to her that she was to be the mother of the promised Messiah (<reflink target="XXX">Luke 1:35</reflink>). After this she went to visit her cousin Elisabeth, who was living with her husband Zacharias (probably at Juttah, Josh. 15:55; 21:16, in the neighbourhood of Maon), at a considerable distance, about 100 miles, from Nazareth. Immediately on entering the house she was saluted by Elisabeth as the mother of her Lord, and then forthwith gave utterance to her hymn of thanksgiving (<reflink target="XXX">Luke 1:46-56; comp. 1 Sam. 2:1-10</reflink>). After three months Mary returned to Nazareth to her own home. Joseph was supernaturally made aware (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 1:18-25</reflink>) of her condition, and took her to his own home. Soon after this the decree of Augustus (<reflink target="XXX">Luke 2:1</reflink>) required that they should proceed to Bethlehem (<reflink target="XXX">Micah 5:2</reflink>), some 80 or 90 miles from Nazareth; and while they were there they found shelter in the inn or khan provided for strangers (<reflink target="XXX">Luke 2:6, 7</reflink>). But as the inn was crowded, Mary had to retire to a place among the cattle, and there she brought forth her son, who was called Jesus (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 1:21</reflink>), because he was to save his people from their sins. This was followed by the presentation in the temple, the flight into Egypt, and their return in the following year and residence at Nazareth (Matt. 2). There for thirty years Mary, the wife of Joseph the carpenter, resides, filling her own humble sphere, and pondering over the strange things that had happened to her. During these years only one event in the history of Jesus is recorded, viz., his going up to Jerusalem when twelve years of age, and his being found among the doctors in the temple (<reflink target="XXX">Luke 2:41-52</reflink>). Probably also during this period Joseph died, for he is not again mentioned.</description>
    <description>After the commencement of our Lord's public ministry little notice is taken of Mary. She was present at the marriage in Cana. A year and a half after this we find her at Capernaum (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 12:46, 48, 49</reflink>), where Christ uttered the memorable words, "Who is my mother? and who are my brethren? And he stretched forth his hand toward his disciples, and said, Behold my mother and my brethren!" The next time we find her is at the cross along with her sister Mary, and Mary Magdalene, and Salome, and other women (<reflink target="XXX">John 19:26</reflink>). From that hour John took her to his own abode. She was with the little company in the upper room after the Ascension (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 1:14</reflink>). From this time she wholly disappears from public notice. The time and manner of her death are unknown.</description>
    <description>(2.) Mary Magdalene, i.e., Mary of Magdala, a town on the western shore of the Lake of Tiberias. She is for the first time noticed in Luke 8:3 as one of the women who "ministered to Christ of their substance." Their motive was that of gratitude for deliverances he had wrought for them. Out of Mary were cast seven demons. Gratitude to her great Deliverer prompted her to become his follower. These women accompanied him also on his last journey to Jerusalem (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 27:55; Mark 15:41; Luke 23:55</reflink>). They stood near the cross. There Mary remained till all was over, and the body was taken down and laid in Joseph's tomb. Again, in the earliest dawn of the first day of the week she, with Salome and Mary the mother of James (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 28:1; Mark 16:2</reflink>), came to the sepulchre, bringing with them sweet spices, that they might anoint the body of Jesus. They found the sepulchre empty, but saw the "vision of angels" (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 28:5</reflink>). She hastens to tell Peter and John, who were probably living together at this time (<reflink target="XXX">John 20:1, 2</reflink>), and again immediately returns to the sepulchre. There she lingers thoughtfully, weeping at the door of the tomb. The risen Lord appears to her, but at first she knows him not. His utterance of her name "Mary" recalls her to consciousness, and she utters the joyful, reverent cry, "Rabboni." She would fain cling to him, but he forbids her, saying, "Touch me not; for I am not yet ascended to my Father." This is the last record regarding Mary of Magdala, who now returned to Jerusalem. The idea that this Mary was "the woman who was a sinner," or that she was unchaste, is altogether groundless.</description>
    <description>(3.) Mary the sister of Lazarus is brought to our notice in connection with the visits of our Lord to Bethany. She is contrasted with her sister Martha, who was "cumbered about many things" while Jesus was their guest, while Mary had chosen "the good part." Her character also appears in connection with the death of her brother (<reflink target="XXX">John 11:20,31,33</reflink>). On the occasion of our Lord's last visit to Bethany, Mary brought "a pound of ointment of spikenard, very costly, and anointed the feet of Jesus" as he reclined at table in the house of one Simon, who had been a leper (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 26:6; Mark 14:3; John 12:2,3</reflink>). This was an evidence of her overflowing love to the Lord. Nothing is known of her subsequent history. It would appear from this act of Mary's, and from the circumstance that they possessed a family vault (11:38), and that a large number of Jews from Jerusalem came to condole with them on the death of Lazarus (11:19), that this family at Bethany belonged to the wealthier class of the people. (<see target="x-self">See MARTHA.</see>)</description>
    <description>(4.) Mary the wife of Cleopas is mentioned (<reflink target="XXX">John 19:25</reflink>) as standing at the cross in company with Mary of Magdala and Mary the mother of Jesus. By comparing Matt. 27:56 and Mark 15:40, we find that this Mary and "Mary the mother of James the little" are on and the same person, and that she was the sister of our Lord's mother. She was that "other Mary" who was present with Mary of Magdala at the burial of our Lord (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 27:61; Mark 15:47</reflink>); and she was one of those who went early in the morning of the first day of the week to anoint the body, and thus became one of the first witnesses of the resurrection (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 28:1; Mark 16:1; Luke 24:1</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(5.) Mary the mother of John Mark was one of the earliest of our Lord's disciples. She was the sister of Barnabas (<reflink target="XXX">Col. 4:10</reflink>), and joined with him in disposing of their land and giving the proceeds of the sale into the treasury of the Church (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 4:37; 12:12</reflink>). Her house in Jerusalem was the common meeting-place for the disciples there.</description>

  <item id="Matthew">
    <description>gift of God, a common Jewish name after the Exile. He was the son of Alphaeus, and was a publican or tax-gatherer at Capernaum. On one occasion Jesus, coming up from the side of the lake, passed the custom-house where Matthew was seated, and said to him, "Follow me." Matthew arose and followed him, and became his disciple (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 9:9</reflink>). Formerly the name by which he was known was Levi (<reflink target="XXX">Mark 2:14; Luke 5:27</reflink>); he now changed it, possibly in grateful memory of his call, to Matthew. The same day on which Jesus called him he made a "great feast" (<reflink target="XXX">Luke 5:29</reflink>), a farewell feast, to which he invited Jesus and his disciples, and probably also many of old associates. He was afterwards selected as one of the twelve (6:15). His name does not occur again in the Gospel history except in the lists of the apostles. The last notice of him is in Acts 1:13. The time and manner of his death are unknown.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Matthew, Gospel according to">
    <description>The author of this book was beyond a doubt the Matthew, an apostle of our Lord, whose name it bears. He wrote the Gospel of Christ according to his own plans and aims, and from his own point of view, as did also the other "evangelists."</description>
    <description>As to the time of its composition, there is little in the Gospel itself to indicate. It was evidently written before the destruction of Jerusalem (Matt. 24), and some time after the events it records. The probability is that it was written between the years A.D. 60 and 65.</description>
    <description>The cast of thought and the forms of expression employed by the writer show that this Gospel was written for Jewish Christians of Palestine. His great object is to prove that Jesus of Nazareth was the promised Messiah, and that in him the ancient prophecies had their fulfilment. The Gospel is full of allusions to those passages of the Old Testament in which Christ is predicted and foreshadowed. The one aim prevading the whole book is to show that Jesus is he "of whom Moses in the law and the prophets did write." This Gospel contains no fewer than sixty-five references to the Old Testament, forty-three of these being direct verbal citations, thus greatly outnumbering those found in the other Gospels. The main feature of this Gospel may be expressed in the motto, "I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil."</description>
    <description>As to the language in which this Gospel was written there is much controversy. Many hold, in accordance with old tradition, that it was originally written in Hebrew (i.e., the Aramaic or Syro-Chaldee dialect, then the vernacular of the inhabitants of Palestine), and afterwards translated into Greek, either by Matthew himself or by some person unknown. This theory, though earnestly maintained by able critics, we cannot see any ground for adopting. From the first this Gospel in Greek was received as of authority in the Church. There is nothing in it to show that it is a translation. Though Matthew wrote mainly for the Jews, yet they were everywhere familiar with the Greek language. The same reasons which would have suggested the necessity of a translation into Greek would have led the evangelist to write in Greek at first. It is confessed that this Gospel has never been found in any other form than that in which we now possess it.</description>
    <description>The leading characteristic of this Gospel is that it sets forth the kingly glory of Christ, and shows him to be the true heir to David's throne. It is the Gospel of the kingdom. Matthew uses the expression "kingdom of heaven" (thirty-two times), while Luke uses the expression "kingdom of God" (thirty-three times). Some Latinized forms occur in this Gospel, as kodrantes (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 5:26</reflink>), for the Latin quadrans, and phragello (27:26), for the Latin flagello. It must be remembered that Matthew was a tax-gatherer for the Roman government, and hence in contact with those using the Latin language.</description>
    <description>As to the relation of the Gospels to each other, we must maintain that each writer of the synoptics (the first three) wrote independently of the other two, Matthew being probably first in point of time.</description>
    <description>"Out of a total of 1071 verses, Matthew has 387 in common with Mark and Luke, 130 with Mark, 184 with Luke; only 387 being peculiar to itself." (<see target="x-self">See MARK; LUKE; GOSPELS.</see>)</description>

A "drink-offering" generally accompanied it. The law regarding it is given in Lev. 2, and 6:14-23. It was a recognition of the sovereignty of God and of his bounty in giving all earthly blessings (<reflink target="XXX">1 Chr. 29:10-14; Deut. 26:5-11</reflink>). It was an offering which took for granted and was based on the offering for sin. It followed the sacrifice of blood.

    <description>We first hear of this people in the Assyrian cuneiform records, under the name of Amada, about B.C. 840. They appear to have been a branch of the Aryans, who came from the east bank of the Indus, and were probably the predominant race for a while in the Mesopotamian valley. They consisted for three or four centuries of a number of tribes, each ruled by its own chief, who at length were brought under the Assyrian yoke (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 17:6</reflink>). From this subjection they achieved deliverance, and formed themselves into an empire under Cyaxares (B.C. 633). This monarch entered into an alliance with the king of Babylon, and invaded Assyria, capturing and destroying the city of Nineveh (B.C. 625), thus putting an end to the Assyrian monarchy (<reflink target="XXX">Nah. 1:8; 2:5,6; 3:13, 14</reflink>).</description>
    <description>Media now rose to a place of great power, vastly extending its boundaries. But it did not long exist as an independent kingdom. It rose with Cyaxares, its first king, and it passed away with him; for during the reign of his son and successor Astyages, the Persians waged war against the Medes and conquered them, the two nations being united under one monarch, Cyrus the Persian (B.C. 558).</description>
    <description>The "cities of the Medes" are first mentioned in connection with the deportation of the Israelites on the destruction of Samaria (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 17:6; 18:11</reflink>). Soon afterwards Isaiah (13:17; 21:2) speaks of the part taken by the Medes in the destruction of Babylon (<reflink target="XXX">comp. Jer. 51:11, 28</reflink>). Daniel gives an account of the reign of Darius the Mede, who was made viceroy by Cyrus (<reflink target="XXX">Dan. 6:1-28</reflink>). The decree of Cyrus, Ezra informs us (6:2-5), was found in "the palace that is in the province of the Medes," Achmetha or Ecbatana of the Greeks, which is the only Median city mentioned in Scripture.</description>

  <item id="Mediator">
    <description>one who intervenes between two persons who are at variance, with a view to reconcile them. This word is not found in the Old Testament; but the idea it expresses is found in Job 9:33, in the word "daysman" (q.v.), marg., "umpire."</description>
    <description>This word is used in the New Testament to denote simply an internuncius, an ambassador, one who acts as a medium of communication between two contracting parties. In this sense Moses is called a mediator in Gal. 3:19.</description>
    <description>Christ is the one and only mediator between God and man (<reflink target="XXX">1 Tim. 2:5; Heb. 8:6; 9:15; 12:24</reflink>).

Such a mediator must be at once divine and human, divine, that his obedience and his sufferings might possess infinite worth, and that he might possess infinite wisdom and knowlege and power to direct all things in the kingdoms of providence and grace which are committed to his hands (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 28:18; John 5:22, 25, 26, 27</reflink>); and human, that in his work he might represent man, and be capable of rendering obedience to the law and satisfying the claims of justice (<reflink target="XXX">Heb. 2:17, 18; 4:15, 16</reflink>), and that in his glorified humanity he might be the head of a glorified Church (<reflink target="XXX">Rom. 8:29</reflink>).</description>
    <description>This office involves the three functions of prophet, priest, and king, all of which are discharged by Christ both in his estate of humiliation and exaltation. These functions are so inherent in the one office that the quality appertaining to each gives character to every mediatorial act. They are never separated in the exercise of the office of mediator.</description>

    <description>The valley or plain of Megiddo was part of the plain of Esdraelon, the great battle-field of Palestine. It was here Barak gained a notable victory over Jabin, the king of Hazor, whose general, Sisera, led on the hostile army. Barak rallied the warriors of the northern tribes, and under the encouragement of Deborah (q.v.), the prophetess, attacked the Canaanites in the great plain. The army of Sisera was thrown into complete confusion, and was engulfed in the waters of the Kishon, which had risen and overflowed its banks (<reflink target="XXX">Judg. 4:5</reflink>).</description>
    <description>Many years after this (B.C. 610), Pharaohnecho II., on his march against the king of Assyria, passed through the plains of Philistia and Sharon; and King Josiah, attempting to bar his progress in the plain of Megiddo, was defeated by the Egyptians. He was wounded in battle, and died as they bore him away in his chariot towards Jerusalem (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 23:29; 2 Chr. 35:22-24</reflink>), and all Israel mourned for him. So general and bitter was this mourning that it became a proverb, to which Zechariah (12:11, 12) alludes. Megiddo has been identified with the modern el-Lejjun, at the head of the Kishon, under the north-eastern brow of Carmel, on the south-western edge of the plain of Esdraelon, and 9 miles west of Jezreel. Others identify it with Mujedd'a, 4 miles south-west of Bethshean, but the question of its site is still undetermined.</description>

    <description>king of righteousness, the king of Salem (q.v.). All we know of him is recorded in Gen. 14:18-20. He is subsequently mentioned only once in the Old Testament, in Ps. 110:4. The typical significance of his history is set forth in detail in the Epistle to the Hebrews, ch. 7. The apostle there points out the superiority of his priesthood to that of Aaron in these several respects, (1) Even Abraham paid him tithes; (2) he blessed Abraham; (3) he is the type of a Priest who lives for ever; (4) Levi, yet unborn, paid him tithes in the person of Abraham; (5) the permanence of his priesthood in Christ implied the abrogation of the Levitical system; (6) he was made priest not without an oath; and (7) his priesthood can neither be transmitted nor interrupted by death: "this man, because he continueth ever, hath an unchangeable priesthood."</description>
    <description>The question as to who this mysterious personage was has given rise to a great deal of modern speculation. It is an old tradition among the Jews that he was Shem, the son of Noah, who may have survived to this time. Melchizedek was a Canaanitish prince, a worshipper of the true God, and in his peculiar history and character an instructive type of our Lord, the great High Priest (<reflink target="XXX">Heb. 5:6, 7; 6:20</reflink>). One of the Amarna tablets is from Ebed-Tob, king of Jerusalem, the successor of Melchizedek, in which he claims the very attributes and dignity given to Melchizedek in the Epistle to the Hebrews.</description>

    <description>(<reflink target="XXX">Acts 27:28</reflink>), an island in the Mediterranean, the modern Malta. Here the ship in which Paul was being conveyed a prisoner to Rome was wrecked. The bay in which it was wrecked now bears the name of "St. Paul's Bay", "a certain creek with a shore." It is about 2 miles deep and 1 broad, and the whole physical condition of the scene answers the description of the shipwreck given in Acts 28. It was originally colonized by Phoenicians ("barbarians," 28:2). It came into the possession of the Greeks (B.C. 736), from whom it was taken by the Carthaginians (B.C. 528). In B.C. 242 it was conquered by the Romans, and was governed by a Roman propraetor at the time of the shipwreck (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 28:7</reflink>). Since 1800, when the French garrison surrendered to the English force, it has been a British dependency. The island is about 17 miles long and 9 wide, and about 60 in circumference. After a stay of three months on this island, during which the "barbarians" showed them no little kindness, Julius procured for himself and his company a passage in another Alexandrian corn-ship which had wintered in the island, in which they proceeded on their voyage to Rome (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 28:13, 14</reflink>).</description>

From certain remains found half buried in the sand, the site of this ancient city has been discovered near the modern village of Minyet Rahinch, or Mitraheny, about 16 miles above the ancient head of the Delta, and 9 miles south of Cairo, on the west bank of the Nile. It is said to have been founded by Menes, the first king of Egypt, and to have been in circumference about 19 miles. "There are few remains above ground," says Manning (The Land of the Pharaohs), "of the splendour of ancient Memphis. The city has utterly disappeared. If any traces yet exist, they are buried beneath the vast mounds of crumbling bricks and broken pottery which meet the eye in every direction. Near the village of Mitraheny is a colossal statue of Rameses the Great. It is apparently one of the two described by Herodotus and Diodorus as standing in front of the temple of Ptah. They were originally 50 feet in height. The one which remains, though mutilated, measures 48 feet. It is finely carved in limestone, which takes a high polish, and is evidently a portrait. It lies in a pit, which, during the inundation, is filled with water. As we gaze on this fallen and battered statue of the mighty conqueror who was probably contemporaneous with Moses, it is impossible not to remember the words of the prophet Isaiah, 19:13; 44:16-19, and Jeremiah, 46:19."</description>

The child's nurse hearing of this calamity, fled with him from Gibeah, the royal residence, and stumbling in her haste, the child was thrown to the ground and maimed in both his feet, and ever after was unable to walk (19:26). He was carried to the land of Gilead, where he found a refuge in the house of Machir, the son of Ammiel, at Lo-debar, by whom he was brought up.</description>

In the distribution of the oxen and waggons offered by the princes (Num. 7), Moses gave twice as many to the Merarites (four waggons and eight oxen) as he gave to the Gershonites, because the latter had to carry only the lighter furniture of the tabernacle, such as the curtains, hangings, etc., while the former had to carry the heavier portion, as the boards, bars, sockets, pillars, etc., and consequently needed a greater supply of oxen and waggons. This is a coincidence illustrative of the truth of the narrative. Their place in marching and in the camp was on the north of the tabernacle.

After the death of Ahab at Ramoth-Gilead, Mesha shook off the yoke of Israel; but on the ascension of Jehoram to the throne of Israel, that king sought the help of Jehoshaphat in an attempt to reduce the Moabites again to their former condition. The united armies of the two kings came unexpectedly on the army of the Moabites, and gained over them an easy victory. The whole land was devastated by the conquering armies, and Mesha sought refuge in his last stronghold, Kir-harasheth (q.v.). Reduced to despair, he ascended the wall of the city, and there, in the sight of the allied armies, offered his first-born son a sacrifice to Chemosh, the fire-god of the Moabites. This fearful spectacle filled the beholders with horror, and they retired from before the besieged city, and recrossed the Jordan laden with spoil (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 3:25-27</reflink>).</description>
    <description>The exploits of Mesha are recorded in the Phoenician inscription on a block of black basalt found at Dibon, in Moab, usually called the "Moabite stone" (q.v.).</description>

They were in all probability the Moschi, a people inhabiting the Moschian Mountains, between the Black and the Caspian Seas. In Ps. 120:5 the name occurs as simply a synonym for foreigners or barbarians. "During the ascendency of the Babylonians and Persians in Western Asia, the Moschi were subdued; but it seems probable that a large number of them crossed the Caucasus range and spread over the northern steppes, mingling with the Scythians. There they became known as Muscovs, and gave that name to the Russian nation and its ancient capital by which they are still generally known throughout the East"</description>

In the Old Testament it is mentioned also under the name "Padan-aram;" i.e., the plain of Aram, or Syria (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 25:20</reflink>). The northern portion of this fertile plateau was the original home of the ancestors of the Hebrews (Gen. 11; Acts 7:2). From this region Isaac obtained his wife Rebecca (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 24:10, 15</reflink>), and here also Jacob sojourned (28:2-7) and obtained his wives, and here most of his sons were born (35:26; 46:15). The petty, independent tribes of this region, each under its own prince, were warlike, and used chariots in battle.

The great Messiah is anointed "above his fellows" (<reflink target="XXX">Ps. 45:7</reflink>); i.e., he embraces in himself all the three offices. The Greek form "Messias" is only twice used in the New Testament, in John 1:41 and 4:25 (R.V., "Messiah"), and in the Old Testament the word Messiah, as the rendering of the Hebrew, occurs only twice (<reflink target="XXX">Dan 9:25, 26; R.V., "the anointed one"</reflink>).</description>
    <description>The first great promise (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 3:15</reflink>) contains in it the germ of all the prophecies recorded in the Old Testament regarding the coming of the Messiah and the great work he was to accomplish on earth. The prophecies became more definite and fuller as the ages rolled on; the light shone more and more unto the perfect day. Different periods of prophetic revelation have been pointed out, (1) the patriarchal; (2) the Mosaic; (3) the period of David; (4) the period of prophetism, i.e., of those prophets whose works form a part of the Old Testament canon. The expectations of the Jews were thus kept alive from generation to generation, till the "fulness of the times," when Messiah came, "made of a woman, made under the law, to redeem them that were under the law." In him all these ancient prophecies have their fulfilment. Jesus of Nazareth is the Messiah, the great Deliverer who was to come. (<reflink target="XXX">Comp.

  </item>
  <item id="Micah, Book of">
    <description>the sixth in order of the so-called minor prophets. The superscription to this book states that the prophet exercised his office in the reigns of Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah. If we reckon from the beginning of Jotham's reign to the end of Hezekiah's (B.C. 759-698), then he ministered for about fifty-nine years; but if we reckon from the death of Jotham to the accession of Hezekiah (B.C. 743-726), his ministry lasted only sixteen years. It has been noticed as remarkable that this book commences with the last words of another prophet, "Micaiah the son of Imlah" (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 22:28</reflink>): "Hearken, O people, every one of you."</description>
    <description>The book consists of three sections, each commencing with a rebuke, "Hear ye," etc., and closing with a promise, (1) ch. 1; 2; (2) ch. 3-5, especially addressed to the princes and heads of the people; (3) ch. 6-7, in which Jehovah is represented as holding a controversy with his people: the whole concluding with a song of triumph at the great deliverance which the Lord will achieve for his people. The closing verse is quoted in the song of Zacharias (<reflink target="XXX">Luke 1:72, 73</reflink>). The prediction regarding the place "where Christ should be born," one of the most remarkable Messianic prophecies (<reflink target="XXX">Micah 5:2</reflink>), is quoted in Matt. 2:6.</description>
    <description>There are the following references to this book in the New Testament:</description>
    <description>5:2, with Matt. 2:6; John 7:42. 7:6, with Matt. 10:21,35,36. 7:20, with Luke 1:72,73.</description>

  <item id="Micaiah">
    <description>who is like Jehovah?, the son of Imlah, a faithful prophet of Samaria (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 22:8-28</reflink>). Three years after the great battle with Ben-hadad (20:29-34), Ahab proposed to Jehoshaphat, king of Judah, that they should go up against Ramoth-Gilead to do battle again with Ben-hadad. Jehoshaphat agreed, but suggested that inquiry should be first made "at the word of Jehovah." Ahab's prophets approved of the expedition; but Jehoshaphat, still dissatisfied, asked if there was no other prophet besides the four hundred that had appeared, and was informed of this Micaiah. He was sent for from prison, where he had been confined, probably on account of some prediction disagreeable to Ahab; and he condemned the expedition, and prophesied that it would end, as it did, in disaster. We hear nothing further of this prophet. Some have supposed that he was the unnamed prophet referred to in 1 Kings 20:35-42.</description>

  <item id="Michal">
    <description>rivulet, or who as God?, the younger of Saul's two daughters by his wife Ahinoam (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 14:49, 50</reflink>). "Attracted by the graces of his person and the gallantry of his conduct, she fell in love with David and became his wife" (18:20-28). She showed her affection for him by promoting his escape to Naioth when Saul sought his life (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 19:12-17. Comp. Ps. 59. See TERAPHIM</reflink>). After this she did not see David for many years. Meanwhile she was given in marriage to another man, Phalti or Phaltiel of Gallim (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 25:44</reflink>), but David afterwards formally reclaimed her as his lawful wife (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 3:13-16</reflink>). The relation between her and David soon after this was altered. They became alienated from each other. This happened on that memorable day when the ark was brought up in great triumph from its temporary resting-place to the Holy City. In David's conduct on that occasion she saw nothing but a needless humiliation of the royal dignity (<reflink target="XXX">1 Chr. 15:29</reflink>). She remained childless, and thus the races of David and Saul were not mixed. In 2 Sam. 21:8 her name again occurs, but the name Merab should probably be here substituted for Michal (comp. 1 Sam. 18:19).</description>

    <description>something hidden, a town of Benjamin (<reflink target="XXX">Ezra 2:27</reflink>), east of Bethel and south of Migron, on the road to Jerusalem (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 10:28</reflink>). It lay on the line of march of an invading army from the north, on the north side of the steep and precipitous Wady es-Suweinit ("valley of the little thorn-tree" or "the acacia"), and now bears the name of Mukhmas. This wady is called "the passage of Michmash" (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 13:23</reflink>). Immediately facing Mukhmas, on the opposite side of the ravine, is the modern representative of Geba, and behind this again are Ramah and Gibeah.</description>
    <description>This was the scene of a great battle fought between the army of Saul and the Philistines, who were utterly routed and pursued for some 16 miles towards Philistia as far as the valley of Aijalon.

The root of the word means to stamp or grave, and hence it is regarded as denoting a composition so precious as to be worthy to be engraven on a durable tablet for preservation; or, as others render, "a psalm precious as stamped gold," from the word _kethem_, "fine or stamped gold."</description>

  <item id="Midianite">
    <description>an Arabian tribe descended from Midian. They inhabited principally the desert north of the peninsula of Arabia. The peninsula of Sinai was the pasture-ground for their flocks. They were virtually the rulers of Arabia, being the dominant tribe. Like all Arabians, they were a nomad people. They early engaged in commercial pursuits. It was to one of their caravans that Joseph was sold (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 37:28, 36</reflink>). The next notice of them is in connection with Moses' flight from Egypt (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 2:15-21</reflink>). Here in Midian Moses became the servant and afterwards the son-in-law of Reuel or Jethro, the priest. After the Exodus, the Midianites were friendly to the Israelites so long as they traversed only their outlying pasture-ground on the west of the Arabah; but when, having passed the southern end of Edom, they entered into the land of Midian proper, they joined with Balak, the king of Moab, in a conspiracy against them (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 22:4-7</reflink>). Balaam, who had been sent for to curse Israel, having utterly failed to do so, was dismissed by the king of Moab; nevertheless he still tarried among the Midianites, and induced them to enter into correspondence with the Israelites, so as to bring them into association with them in the licentious orgies connected with the worship of Baal-Peor. This crafty counsel prevailed. The Israelites took part in the heathen festival, and so brought upon themselves a curse indeed. Their apostasy brought upon them a severe punishment. A plague broke out amongst them, and more than twenty-four thousand of the people perished (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 25:9</reflink>). But the Midianites were not to be left unpunished. A terrible vengeance was denounced against them. A thousand warriors from each tribe, under the leadership of Phinehas, went forth against them. The Midianites were utterly routed. Their cities were consumed by fire, five of their kings were put to death, and the whole nation was destroyed (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 13:21, 22</reflink>). Balaam also perished by the sword, receiving the "wages of his unrighteousness" (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 31:8; 2 Pet. 2:15</reflink>). The whole of the country on the east of Jordan, now conquered by the Israelites (<see target="x-self">see SIHON; OG</see>), was divided between the two tribes of Reuben and Gad and the half tribe of Manasseh.</description>
    <description>Some two hundred and fifty years after this the Midianites had regained their ancient power, and in confederation with the Amalekites and the "children of the east" they made war against their old enemies the Israelites, whom for seven years they oppressed and held in subjection. They were at length assailed by Gideon in that ever-memorable battle in the great plain of Esdraelon, and utterly destroyed (<reflink target="XXX">Judg. 6:1-ch. 7</reflink>). Frequent allusions are afterwards made to this great victory (<reflink target="XXX">Ps. 83:10, 12; Isa. 9:4; 10:6</reflink>). They now wholly pass away from the page of history both sacred and profane.</description>

  <item id="Mile">
    <description>(from Lat. mille, "a thousand;" Matt. 5:41), a Roman measure of 1,000 paces of 5 feet each. Thus the Roman mile has 1618 yards, being 142 yards shorter than the English mile.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Miletus">
    <description>(Miletum, 2 Tim. 4:20), a seaport town and the ancient capital of Ionia, about 36 miles south of Ephesus. On his voyage from Greece to Syria, Paul touched at this port, and delivered that noble and pathetic address to the elders ("presbyters," ver. 28) of Ephesus recorded in Acts 20:15-35. The site of Miletus is now some 10 miles from the coast. (See EPHESIANS, EPISTLE TO</description>

  <item id="Milk">
    <description>(1.) Hebrew halabh, "new milk", milk in its fresh state (<reflink target="XXX">Judg. 4:19</reflink>). It is frequently mentioned in connection with honey (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 3:8; 13:5; Josh. 5:6; Isa. 7:15, 22; Jer. 11:5</reflink>). Sheep (<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 32:14</reflink>) and goats (<reflink target="XXX">Prov. 27:27</reflink>) and camels (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 32:15</reflink>), as well as cows, are made to give their milk for the use of man. Milk is used figuratively as a sign of abundance (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 49:12; Ezek. 25:4; Joel 3:18</reflink>). It is also a symbol of the rudiments of doctrine (<reflink target="XXX">1 Cor. 3:2; Heb. 5:12, 13</reflink>), and of the unadulterated word of God (<reflink target="XXX">1 Pet. 2:2</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(2.) Heb. hem'ah, always rendered "butter" in the Authorized Version. It means "butter," but also more frequently "cream," or perhaps, as some think, "curdled milk," such as that which Abraham set before the angels (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 18:8</reflink>), and which Jael gave to Sisera (<reflink target="XXX">Judg. 5:25</reflink>). In this state milk was used by travellers (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 17:29</reflink>). If kept long enough, it acquired a slightly intoxicating or soporific power.</description>
    <description>This Hebrew word is also sometimes used for milk in general (<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 32:14; Job 20:17</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Mill">
    <description>for grinding corn, mentioned as used in the time of Abraham (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 18:6</reflink>). That used by the Hebrews consisted of two circular stones, each 2 feet in diameter and half a foot thick, the lower of which was called the "nether millstone" (<reflink target="XXX">Job 41:24</reflink>) and the upper the "rider." The upper stone was turned round by a stick fixed in it as a handle. There were then no public mills, and thus each family required to be provided with a hand-mill. The corn was ground daily, generally by the women of the house (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 47:1, 2; Matt. 24:41</reflink>). It was with the upper stone of a hand-mill that "a certain woman" at Thebez broke Abimelech's skull (<reflink target="XXX">Judg. 9:53, "a piece of a millstone;" literally, "a millstone rider", i.e., the "runner," the stone which revolves. Comp. 2 Sam. 11:21</reflink>). Millstones could not be pledged (<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 24:6</reflink>), as they were necessary in every family.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Millennium">
    <description>a thousand years; the name given to the era mentioned in Rev. 20:1-7. Some maintain that Christ will personally appear on earth for the purpose of establishing his kingdom at the beginning of this millennium. Those holding this view are usually called "millenarians." On the other hand, it is maintained, more in accordance with the teaching of Scripture, we think, that Christ's second advent will not be premillennial, and that the right conception of the prospects and destiny of his kingdom is that which is taught, e.g., in the parables of the leaven and the mustard-seed. The triumph of the gospel, it is held, must be looked for by the wider and more efficient operation of the very forces that are now at work in extending the gospel; and that Christ will only come again at the close of this dispensation to judge the world at the "last day." The millennium will thus precede his coming.</description>

  <item id="Millet">
    <description>(Heb. dohan; only in Ezek. 4:9), a small grain, the produce of the Panicum miliaceum of botanists. It is universally cultivated in the East as one of the smaller corn-grasses. This seed is the cenchros of the Greeks. It is called in India warree, and by the Arabs dukhan, and is extensively used for food, being often mixed with other grain. In this country it is only used for feeding birds.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Millo">
    <description>(Heb. always with the article, "the" Millo). (1.) Probably the Canaanite name of some fortification, consisting of walls filled in with earth and stones, which protected Jerusalem on the north as its outermost defence. It is always rendered Akra i.e., "the citadel", in the LXX. It was already existing when David conquered Jerusalem (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 5:9</reflink>). He extended it to the right and left, thus completing the defence of the city. It was rebuilt by Solomon (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 9:15, 24; 11:27</reflink>) and repaired by Hezekiah (<reflink target="XXX">2 Chr. 32:5</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(2.) In Judg. 9:6, 20 it is the name of a rampart in Shechem, probably the "tower of Shechem" (9:46, 49).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Mincing">
    <description>(Heb. taphoph, Isa. 3:16), taking affectedly short and quick steps. Luther renders the word by "wag" or "waggle," thus representing "the affected gait of coquettish females."</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Mine">
    <description>The process of mining is described in Job 28:1-11. Moses speaks of the mineral wealth of Palestine (<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 8:9</reflink>). Job 28:4 is rightly thus rendered in the Revised Version, "He breaketh open a shaft away from where men sojourn; they are forgotten of the foot [that passeth by]; they hang afar from men, they swing to and fro." These words illustrate ancient mining operations.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Minister">
    <description>one who serves, as distinguished from the master. (1.) Heb. meshereth, applied to an attendant on one of superior rank, as to Joshua, the servant of Moses (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 33:11</reflink>), and to the servant of Elisha (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 4:43</reflink>). This name is also given to attendants at court (<reflink target="XXX">2 Chr. 22:8</reflink>), and to the priests and Levites (<reflink target="XXX">Jer. 33:21; Ezek. 44:11</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(2.) Heb. pelah (<reflink target="XXX">Ezra 7:24</reflink>), a "minister" of religion. Here used of that class of sanctuary servants called "Solomon's servants" in Ezra 2:55-58 and Neh. 7:57-60.</description>
    <description>(3.) Greek leitourgos, a subordinate public administrator, and in this sense applied to magistrates (<reflink target="XXX">Rom. 13:6</reflink>). It is applied also to our Lord (<reflink target="XXX">Heb. 8:2</reflink>), and to Paul in relation to Christ (<reflink target="XXX">Rom. 15:16</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(4.) Greek hyperetes (literally, "under-rower"), a personal attendant on a superior, thus of the person who waited on the officiating priest in the synagogue (<reflink target="XXX">Luke 4:20</reflink>). It is applied also to John Mark, the attendant on Paul and Barnabas (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 13:5</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(5.) Greek diaconos, usually a subordinate officer or assistant employed in relation to the ministry of the gospel, as to Paul and Apollos (<reflink target="XXX">1 Cor. 3:5</reflink>), Tychicus (<reflink target="XXX">Eph. 6:21</reflink>), Epaphras (<reflink target="XXX">Col. 1:7</reflink>), Timothy (<reflink target="XXX">1 Thess. 3:2</reflink>), and also to Christ (<reflink target="XXX">Rom. 15:8</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Minni">
    <description>only in Jer. 51:27, as the name of a province in Armenia, which was at this time under the Median kings. Armenia is regarded by some as = Har-minni i.e., the mountainous country of Minni. (<see target="x-self">See ARMENIA.</see>)</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Minnith">
    <description>distribution, an Ammonitish town (<reflink target="XXX">Judg. 11:33</reflink>) from which wheat was exported to Tyre (<reflink target="XXX">Ezek. 27:17</reflink>). It was probably somewhere in the Mishor or table-land on the east of Jordan. There is a gentle valley running for about 4 miles east of Dhiban called Kurm Dhiban, "the vineyards of Dibon." Tristram supposes that this may be the "vineyards" mentioned in Judg. (l.c.).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Minstrel">
    <description>(<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 9:23</reflink>), a flute-player. Such music was a usual accompaniment of funerals. In 2 Kings 3:15 it denotes a player on a stringed instrument.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Mint">
    <description>(Gr. heduosmon, i.e., "having a sweet smell"), one of the garden herbs of which the Pharisees paid tithes (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 23:23; Luke 11:42</reflink>). It belongs to the labiate family of plants. The species most common in Syria is the Mentha sylvestris, the wild mint, which grows much larger than the garden mint (M. sativa). It was much used in domestic economy as a condiment, and also as a medicine. The paying of tithes of mint was in accordance with the Mosiac law (<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 14:22</reflink>), but the error of the Pharisees lay in their being more careful about this little matter of the mint than about weightier matters.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Miracle">
    <description>an event in the external world brought about by the immediate agency or the simple volition of God, operating without the use of means capable of being discerned by the senses, and designed to authenticate the divine commission of a religious teacher and the truth of his message (<reflink target="XXX">John 2:18; Matt. 12:38</reflink>). It is an occurrence at once above nature and above man. It shows the intervention of a power that is not limited by the laws either of matter or of mind, a power interrupting the fixed laws which govern their movements, a supernatural power.</description>
    <description>"The suspension or violation of the laws of nature involved in miracles is nothing more than is constantly taking place around us. One force counteracts another: vital force keeps the chemical laws of matter in abeyance; and muscular force can control the action of physical force. When a man raises a weight from the ground, the law of gravity is neither suspended nor violated, but counteracted by a stronger force. The same is true as to the walking of Christ on the water and the swimming of iron at the command of the prophet. The simple and grand truth that the universe is not under the exclusive control of physical forces, but that everywhere and always there is above, separate from and superior to all else, an infinite personal will, not superseding, but directing and controlling all physical causes, acting with or without them." God ordinarily effects his purpose through the agency of second causes; but he has the power also of effecting his purpose immediately and without the intervention of second causes, i.e., of invading the fixed order, and thus of working miracles. Thus we affirm the possibility of miracles, the possibility of a higher hand intervening to control or reverse nature's ordinary movements.</description>
    <description>In the New Testament these four Greek words are principally used to designate miracles: (1.) Semeion, a "sign", i.e., an evidence of a divine commission; an attestation of a divine message (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 12:38, 39; 16:1, 4; Mark 8:11; Luke 11:16; 23:8; John 2:11, 18, 23; Acts 6:8, etc.</reflink>); a token of the presence and working of God; the seal of a higher power.</description>
    <description>(2.) Terata, "wonders;" wonder-causing events; portents; producing astonishment in the beholder (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 2:19</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(3.) Dunameis, "might works;" works of superhuman power (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 2:22; Rom. 15:19; 2 Thess. 2:9</reflink>); of a new and higher power.</description>
    <description>(4.) Erga, "works;" the works of Him who is "wonderful in working" (<reflink target="XXX">John 5:20, 36</reflink>).</description>
    <description>Miracles are seals of a divine mission. The sacred writers appealed to them as proofs that they were messengers of God. Our Lord also appealed to miracles as a conclusive proof of his divine mission (<reflink target="XXX">John 5:20, 36; 10:25, 38</reflink>). Thus, being out of the common course of nature and beyond the power of man, they are fitted to convey the impression of the presence and power of God. Where miracles are there certainly God is. The man, therefore, who works a miracle affords thereby clear proof that he comes with the authority of God; they are his credentials that he is God's messenger. The teacher points to these credentials, and they are a proof that he speaks with the authority of God. He boldly says, "God bears me witness, both with signs and wonders, and with divers miracles."</description>
    <description>The credibility of miracles is established by the evidence of the senses on the part of those who are witnesses of them, and to all others by the testimony of such witnesses. The witnesses were competent, and their testimony is trustworthy. Unbelievers, following Hume, deny that any testimony can prove a miracle, because they say miracles are impossible. We have shown that miracles are possible, and surely they can be borne witness to. Surely they are credible when we have abundant and trustworthy evidence of their occurrence. They are credible just as any facts of history well authenticated are credible. Miracles, it is said, are contrary to experience. Of course they are contrary to our experience, but that does not prove that they were contrary to the experience of those who witnessed them. We believe a thousand facts, both of history and of science, that are contrary to our experience, but we believe them on the ground of competent testimony. An atheist or a pantheist must, as a matter of course, deny the possibility of miracles; but to one who believes in a personal God, who in his wisdom may see fit to interfere with the ordinary processes of nature, miracles are not impossible, nor are they incredible.

  <item id="Miriam">
    <description>their rebellion. (1.) The sister of Moses and Aaron (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 2:4-10; 1 Chr. 6:3</reflink>). Her name is prominent in the history of the Exodus. She is called "the prophetess" (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 15:20</reflink>). She took the lead in the song of triumph after the passage of the Red Sea. She died at Kadesh during the second encampment at that place, toward the close of the wanderings in the wilderness, and was buried there (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 20:1</reflink>). (<see target="x-self">See AARON; MOSES.</see>)</description>

  </item>
  <item id="Misdeem">
    <description>(<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 32:27, R.V.</reflink>). The Authorized Version reads, "should behave themselves strangely;" i.e., not recognize the truth, misunderstand or mistake the cause of Israel's ruin, which was due to the fact that God had forsaken them on account of their apostasy.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Misgab">
    <description>height, a town of Moab, or simply, the height=the citadel, some fortress so called; or perhaps a general name for the highlands of Moab, as some think (<reflink target="XXX">Jer. 48:1</reflink>). In Isa. 25:12, the word is rendered "high fort."</description>

  <item id="Mishael">
    <description>who is like God! (1.) A Levite; the eldest of the three sons of Uzziel (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 6:22</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(2.) One of the three Hebrew youths who were trained with Daniel in Babylon (<reflink target="XXX">Dan. 1:11, 19</reflink>), and promoted to the rank of Magi. He and his companions were afterwards cast into the burning fiery furnace for refusing to worship the idol the king had set up, from which they were miraculously delivered (3:13-30). His Chaldean name was Meshach (q.v.).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Mishal">
    <description>a city of the tribe of Asher (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 21:30; 1 Chr. 6:74</reflink>). It is probably the modern Misalli, on the shore near Carmel.</description>

    <description>burning of waters, supposed to be salt-pans, or lime-kilns, or glass-factories, a place to which Joshua pursued a party of Canaanites after the defeat of Jabin (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 11:8</reflink>). It is identified with the ruin Musheirifeh, at the promontory of en-Nakhurah, some 11 miles north of Acre.</description>

  <item id="Mite">
    <description>contraction of minute, from the Latin minutum, the translation of the Greek word lepton, the very smallest bronze of copper coin (<reflink target="XXX">Luke 12:59; 21:2</reflink>).

  <item id="Mitre">
    <description>(Heb. mitsnepheth), something rolled round the head; the turban or head-dress of the high priest (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 28:4, 37, 39; 29:6, etc.</reflink>). In the Authorized Version of Ezek. 21:26, this Hebrew word is rendered "diadem," but in the Revised Version, "mitre." It was a twisted band of fine linen, 8 yards in length, coiled into the form of a cap, and worn on official occasions (<reflink target="XXX">Lev. 8:9; 16:4; Zech. 3:5</reflink>). On the front of it was a golden plate with the inscription, "Holiness to the Lord." The mitsnepheth differed from the mitre or head-dress (migba'ah) of the common priest. (<see target="x-self">See BONNET.</see>)</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Mitylene">
    <description>the chief city of the island of Lesbos, on its east coast, in the AEgean Sea. Paul, during his third missionary journey, touched at this place on his way from Corinth to Judea (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 20:14</reflink>), and here tarried for a night. It lies between Assos and Chios. It is now under the Turkish rule, and bears the name of Metelin.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Mixed multitude">
    <description>(<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 12:38</reflink>), a class who accompanied the Israelites as they journeyed from Rameses to Succoth, the first stage of the Exodus. These were probably miscellaneous hangers-on to the Hebrews, whether Egyptians of the lower orders, or the remains of the Hyksos (<see target="x-self">see EGYPT; MOSES</see>), as some think. The same thing happened on the return of the Jews from Babylon (<reflink target="XXX">Neh. 13:3</reflink>), a "mixed multitude" accompanied them so far.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Mizar">
    <description>smallness, a summit on the eastern ridge of Lebanon, near which David lay after escaping from Absalom (<reflink target="XXX">Ps. 42:6</reflink>). It may, perhaps, be the present Jebel Ajlun, thus named, "the little", in contrast with the greater elevation of Lebanon and Hermon.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Mizpah">
    <description>or Miz'peh, watch-tower; the look-out. (1.) A place in Gilead, so named by Laban, who overtook Jacob at this spot (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 31:49</reflink>) on his return to Palestine from Padan-aram. Here Jacob and Laban set up their memorial cairn of stones. It is the same as Ramath-mizpeh (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 13:26</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(2.) A town in Gilead, where Jephthah resided, and where he assumed the command of the Israelites in a time of national danger. Here he made his rash vow; and here his daughter submitted to her mysterious fate (<reflink target="XXX">Judg. 10:17; 11:11, 34</reflink>). It may be the same as Ramoth-Gilead (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 20:8</reflink>), but it is more likely that it is identical with the foregoing, the Mizpeh of Gen. 31:23, 25, 48, 49.</description>
    <description>(3.) Another place in Gilead, at the foot of Mount Hermon, inhabited by Hivites (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 11:3, 8</reflink>). The name in Hebrew here has the article before it, "the Mizpeh," "the watch-tower." The modern village of Metullah, meaning also "the look-out," probably occupies the site so called.</description>
    <description>(4.) A town of Moab to which David removed his parents for safety during his persecution by Saul (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 22:3</reflink>). This was probably the citadel known as Kir-Moab, now Kerak. While David resided here he was visited by the prophet Gad, here mentioned for the first time, who was probably sent by Samuel to bid him leave the land of Moab and betake himself to the land of Judah. He accordingly removed to the forest of Hareth (q.v.), on the edge of the mountain chain of Hebron.</description>
    <description>(5.) A city of Benjamin, "the watch-tower", where the people were accustomed to meet in great national emergencies (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 18:26; Judg. 20:1, 3; 21:1, 5; 1 Sam. 7:5-16</reflink>). It has been supposed to be the same as Nob (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 21:1; 22:9-19</reflink>). It was some 4 miles north-west of Jerusalem, and was situated on the loftiest hill in the neighbourhood, some 600 feet above the plain of Gibeon. This village has the modern name of Neby Samwil, i.e., the prophet Samuel, from a tradition that Samuel's tomb is here. (<see target="x-self">See NOB.</see>)</description>
    <description>Samuel inaugurated the reformation that characterized his time by convening a great assembly of all Israel at Mizpeh, now the politico-religious centre of the nation. There, in deep humiliation on account of their sins, they renewed their vows and entered again into covenant with the God of their fathers. It was a period of great religious awakening and of revived national life. The Philistines heard of this assembly, and came up against Israel. The Hebrews charged the Philistine host with great fury, and they were totally routed. Samuel commemorated this signal victory by erecting a memorial-stone, which he called "Ebenezer" (q.v.), saying, "Hitherto hath the Lord helped us" (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 7:7-12</reflink>).</description>

  <item id="Mizraim">
    <description>the dual form of matzor, meaning a "mound" or "fortress," the name of a people descended from Ham (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 10:6, 13; 1 Chr. 1:8, 11</reflink>). It was the name generally given by the Hebrews to the land of Egypt (q.v.), and may denote the two Egypts, the Upper and the Lower. The modern Arabic name for Egypt is Muzr.</description>

  </item>
  <item id="Mnason">
    <description>reminding, or remembrancer, a Christian of Jerusalem with whom Paul lodged (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 21:16</reflink>). He was apparently a native of Cyprus, like Barnabas (11:19, 20), and was well known to the Christians of Caesarea (4:36). He was an "old disciple" (R.V., "early disciple"), i.e., he had become a Christian in the beginning of the formation of the Church in Jerusalem.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Moab">
    <description>the seed of the father, or, according to others, the desirable land, the eldest son of Lot (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 19:37</reflink>), of incestuous birth.</description>
    <description>(2.) Used to denote the people of Moab (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 22:3-14; Judg. 3:30; 2 Sam. 8:2; Jer. 48:11, 13</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(3.) The land of Moab (<reflink target="XXX">Jer. 48:24</reflink>), called also the "country of Moab" (<reflink target="XXX">Ruth 1:2, 6; 2:6</reflink>), on the east of Jordan and the Dead Sea, and south of the Arnon (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 21:13, 26</reflink>). In a wider sense it included the whole region that had been occupied by the Amorites. It bears the modern name of Kerak.</description>
    <description>In the Plains of Moab, opposite Jericho (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 22:1; 26:63; Josh. 13:32</reflink>), the children of Israel had their last encampment before they entered the land of Canaan. It was at that time in the possession of the Amorites (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 21:22</reflink>). "Moses went up from the plains of Moab unto the mountain of Nebo, to the top of Pisgah," and "died there in the land of Moab, according to the word of the Lord" (<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 34:5, 6</reflink>). "Surely if we had nothing else to interest us in the land of Moab, the fact that it was from the top of Pisgah, its noblest height, this mightiest of the prophets looked out with eye undimmed upon the Promised Land; that it was here on Nebo, its loftiest mountain, that he died his solitary death; that it was here, in the valley over against Beth-peor, he found his mysterious sepulchre, we have enough to enshrine the memory in our hearts."</description>

  <item id="Moabite">
    <description>the designation of a tribe descended from Moab, the son of Lot (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 19:37</reflink>). From Zoar, the cradle of this tribe, on the south-eastern border of the Dead Sea, they gradually spread over the region on the east of Jordan. Rameses II., the Pharaoh of the Oppression, enumerates Moab (Muab) among his conquests. Shortly before the Exodus, the warlike Amorites crossed the Jordan under Sihon their king and drove the Moabites (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 21:26-30</reflink>) out of the region between the Arnon and the Jabbok, and occupied it, making Heshbon their capital. They were then confined to the territory to the south of the Arnon.</description>
    <description>On their journey the Israelites did not pass through Moab, but through the "wilderness" to the east (<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 2:8; Judg. 11:18</reflink>), at length reaching the country to the north of the Arnon. Here they remained for some time till they had conquered Bashan (<see target="x-self">see SIHON; OG</see>). The Moabites were alarmed, and their king, Balak, sought aid from the Midianites (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 22:2-4</reflink>). It was while they were here that the visit of Balaam (q.v.) to Balak took place. (<see target="x-self">See MOSES.</see>)</description>
    <description>After the Conquest, the Moabites maintained hostile relations with the Israelites, and frequently harassed them in war (<reflink target="XXX">Judg. 3:12-30; 1 Sam. 14</reflink>). The story of Ruth, however, shows the existence of friendly relations between Moab and Bethlehem. By his descent from Ruth, David may be said to have had Moabite blood in his veins. Yet there was war between David and the Moabites (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 8:2; 23:20; 1 Chr. 18:2</reflink>), from whom he took great spoil (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 8:2, 11, 12; 1 Chr. 11:22; 18:11</reflink>).</description>
    <description>During the one hundred and fifty years which followed the defeat of the Moabites, after the death of Ahab (<see target="x-self">see MESHA</see>), they regained, apparently, much of their former prosperty. At this time Isaiah (15:1) delivered his "burden of Moab," predicting the coming of judgment on that land (comp. 2 Kings 17:3; 18:9; 1 Chr. 5:25, 26). Between the time of Isaiah and the commencement of the Babylonian captivity we have very seldom any reference to Moab (<reflink target="XXX">Jer. 25:21; 27:3; 40:11; Zeph. 2:8-10</reflink>).</description>
    <description>After the Return, it was Sanballat, a Moabite, who took chief part in seeking to prevent the rebuilding of Jerusalem (<reflink target="XXX">Neh. 2:19; 4:1; 6:1</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Moabite Stone">
    <description>a basalt stone, bearing an inscription by King Mesha, which was discovered at Dibon by Klein, a German missionary at Jerusalem, in 1868. It was 3 1/2 feet high and 2 in breadth and in thickness, rounded at the top. It consisted of thirty-four lines, written in Hebrew-Phoenician characters. It was set up by Mesha as a record and memorial of his victories. It records (1) Mesha's wars with Omri, (2) his public buildings, and (3) his wars against Horonaim. This inscription in a remarkable degree supplements and corroborates the history of King Mesha recorded in 2 Kings 3:4-27.</description>
    <description>With the exception of a very few variations, the Moabite language in which the inscription is written is identical with the Hebrew. The form of the letters here used supplies very important and interesting information regarding the history of the formation of the alphabet, as well as, incidentally, regarding the arts of civilized life of those times in the land of Moab.</description>
    <description>This ancient monument, recording the heroic struggles of King Mesha with Omri and Ahab, was erected about B.C. 900. Here "we have the identical slab on which the workmen of the old world carved the history of their own times, and from which the eye of their contemporaries read thousands of years ago the record of events of which they themselves had been the witnesses." It is the oldest inscription written in alphabetic characters, and hence is, apart from its value in the domain of Hebrew antiquities, of great linguistic importance.</description>

  <item id="Moladah">
    <description>birth, a city in the south of Judah which fell to Simeon (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 15:21-26; 19:2</reflink>). It has been identified with the modern el-Milh, 10 miles east of Beersheba.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Mole">
    <description>Heb. tinshameth (<reflink target="XXX">Lev. 11:30</reflink>), probably signifies some species of lizard (rendered in R.V., "chameleon"). In Lev. 11:18, Deut. 14:16, it is rendered, in Authorized Version, "swan" (R.V., "horned owl").</description>
    <description>The Heb. holed (<reflink target="XXX">Lev. 11:29</reflink>), rendered "weasel," was probably the mole-rat. The true mole (Talpa Europoea) is not found in Palestine. The mole-rat (Spalax typhlus) "is twice the size of our mole, with no external eyes, and with only faint traces within of the rudimentary organ; no apparent ears, but, like the mole, with great internal organs of hearing; a strong, bare snout, and with large gnawing teeth; its colour a pale slate; its feet short, and provided with strong nails; its tail only rudimentary."</description>
    <description>In Isa. 2:20, this word is the rendering of two words _haphar peroth_, which are rendered by Gesenius "into the digging of rats", i.e., rats' holes. But these two Hebrew words ought probably to be combined into one (lahporperoth) and translated "to the moles", i.e., the rat-moles. This animal "lives in underground communities, making large subterranean chambers for its young and for storehouses, with many runs connected with them, and is decidedly partial to the loose debris among ruins and stone-heaps, where it can form its chambers with least trouble."</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Moloch">
    <description>king, the name of the national god of the Ammonites, to whom children were sacrificed by fire. He was the consuming and destroying and also at the same time the purifying fire. In Amos 5:26, "your Moloch" of the Authorized Version is "your king" in the Revised Version (<reflink target="XXX">comp. Acts 7:43</reflink>). Solomon (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 11:7</reflink>) erected a high place for this idol on the Mount of Olives, and from that time till the days of Josiah his worship continued (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 23:10, 13</reflink>). In the days of Jehoahaz it was partially restored, but after the Captivity wholly disappeared. He is also called Molech (<reflink target="XXX">Lev. 18:21; 20:2-5, etc.</reflink>), Milcom (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 11:5, 33, etc.</reflink>), and Malcham (<reflink target="XXX">Zeph. 1:5</reflink>). This god became Chemosh among the Moabites.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Money">
    <description>Of uncoined money the first notice we have is in the history of Abraham (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 13:2; 20:16; 24:35</reflink>). Next, this word is used in connection with the purchase of the cave of Machpelah (23:16), and again in connection with Jacob's purchase of a field at Shalem (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 33:18, 19</reflink>) for "an hundred pieces of money"=an hundred Hebrew kesitahs (q.v.), i.e., probably pieces of money, as is supposed, bearing the figure of a lamb.</description>
    <description>The history of Joseph affords evidence of the constant use of money, silver of a fixed weight. This appears also in all the subsequent history of the Jewish people, in all their internal as well as foreign transactions. There were in common use in trade silver pieces of a definite weight, shekels, half-shekels, and quarter-shekels. But these were not properly coins, which are pieces of metal authoritatively issued, and bearing a stamp.</description>
    <description>Of the use of coined money we have no early notice among the Hebrews. The first mentioned is of Persian coinage, the daric (<reflink target="XXX">Ezra 2:69; Neh. 7:70</reflink>) and the 'adarkon (<reflink target="XXX">Ezra 8:27</reflink>). The daric (q.v.) was a gold piece current in Palestine in the time of Cyrus. As long as the Jews, after the Exile, lived under Persian rule, they used Persian coins. These gave place to Greek coins when Palestine came under the dominion of the Greeks (B.C. 331), the coins consisting of gold, silver, and copper pieces. The usual gold pieces were staters (q.v.), and the silver coins tetradrachms and drachms.</description>
    <description>In the year B.C. 140, Antiochus VII. gave permission to Simon the Maccabee to coin Jewish money. Shekels (q.v.) were then coined bearing the figure of the almond rod and the pot of manna.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Money-changer">
    <description>(<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 21:12; Mark 11:15; John 2:15</reflink>). Every Israelite from twenty years and upwards had to pay (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 30:13-15</reflink>) into the sacred treasury half a shekel every year as an offering to Jehovah, and that in the exact Hebrew half-shekel piece. There was a class of men, who frequented the temple courts, who exchanged at a certain premium foreign moneys for these half-shekels to the Jews who came up to Jerusalem from all parts of the world. (<see target="x-self">See PASSOVER.</see>) When our Lord drove the traffickers out of the temple, these money-changers fared worst. Their tables were overturned and they themselves were expelled.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Month">
    <description>Among the Egyptians the month of thirty days each was in use long before the time of the Exodus, and formed the basis of their calculations. From the time of the institution of the Mosaic law the month among the Jews was lunar. The cycle of religious feasts depended on the moon. The commencement of a month was determined by the observation of the new moon. The number of months in the year was usually twelve (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 4:7; 1 Chr. 27:1-15</reflink>); but every third year an additional month (ve-Adar) was inserted, so as to make the months coincide with the seasons.</description>
    <description>"The Hebrews and Phoenicians had no word for month save 'moon,' and only saved their calendar from becoming vague like that of the Moslems by the interpolation of an additional month. There is no evidence at all that they ever used a true solar year such as the Egyptians possessed. The latter had twelve months of thirty days and five epagomenac or odd days.", Palestine Quarterly, January 1889.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Moon">
    <description>heb. yareah, from its paleness (<reflink target="XXX">Ezra 6:15</reflink>), and lebanah, the "white" (<reflink target="XXX">Cant. 6:10; Isa. 24:23</reflink>), was appointed by the Creator to be with the sun "for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years" (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 1:14-16</reflink>). A lunation was among the Jews the period of a month, and several of their festivals were held on the day of the new moon. It is frequently referred to along with the sun (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 10:12; Ps. 72:5, 7, 17; 89:36, 37; Eccl. 12:2; Isa. 24:23, etc.</reflink>), and also by itself (<reflink target="XXX">Ps. 8:3; 121:6</reflink>).</description>
    <description>The great brilliance of the moon in Eastern countries led to its being early an object of idolatrous worship (<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 4:19; 17:3; Job 31:26</reflink>), a form of idolatry against which the Jews were warned (<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 4:19; 17:3</reflink>). They, however, fell into this idolatry, and offered incense (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 23:5; Jer. 8:2</reflink>), and also cakes of honey, to the moon (<reflink target="XXX">Jer. 7:18; 44:17-19, 25</reflink>).</description>

  <item id="Mordecai">
    <description>the son of Jair, of the tribe of Benjamin. It has been alleged that he was carried into captivity with Jeconiah, and hence that he must have been at least one hundred and twenty-nine years old in the twelfth year of Ahasuerus (Xerxes). But the words of Esther do not necessarily lead to this conclusion. It was probably Kish of whom it is said (ver. 6) that he "had been carried away with the captivity."</description>
    <description>He resided at Susa, the metropolis of Persia. He adopted his cousin Hadassah (Esther), an orphan child, whom he tenderly brought up as his own daughter. When she was brought into the king's harem and made queen in the room of the deposed queen Vashti, he was promoted to some office in the court of Ahasuerus, and was one of those who "sat in the king's gate" (<reflink target="XXX">Esther 2:21</reflink>). While holding this office, he discovered a plot of the eunuchs to put the king to death, which, by his vigilance, was defeated. His services to the king in this matter were duly recorded in the royal chronicles.</description>
    <description>Haman (q.v.) the Agagite had been raised to the highest position at court. Mordecai refused to bow down before him; and Haman, being stung to the quick by the conduct of Mordecai, resolved to accomplish his death in a wholesale destruction of the Jewish exiles throughout the Persian empire (<reflink target="XXX">Esther 3:8-15</reflink>). Tidings of this cruel scheme soon reached the ears of Mordecai, who communicated with Queen Esther regarding it, and by her wise and bold intervention the scheme was frustrated. The Jews were delivered from destruction, Mordecai was raised to a high rank, and Haman was executed on the gallows he had by anticipation erected for Mordecai (6:2-7:10). In memory of the signal deliverance thus wrought for them, the Jews to this day celebrate the feast (9:26-32) of Purim (q.v.).</description>

  <item id="Moreh">
    <description>an archer, teacher; fruitful. (1.) A Canaanite probably who inhabited the district south of Shechem, between Mounts Ebal and Gerizim, and gave his name to the "plain" there (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 12:6</reflink>). Here at this "plain," or rather (R.V.) "oak," of Moreh, Abraham built his first altar in the land of Palestine; and here the Lord appeared unto him. He afterwards left this plain and moved southward, and pitched his tent between Bethel on the west and Hai on the east (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 12:7, 8</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Moreh, the Hill of">
    <description>probably identical with "little Hermon," the modern Jebel ed-Duhy, or perhaps one of the lower spurs of this mountain. It is a gray ridge parallel to Gilboa on the north; and between the two lay the battle-field, the plain of Jezreel (q.v.), where Gideon overthrew the Midianites (<reflink target="XXX">Judg. 7:1-12</reflink>).</description>

  <item id="Moresheth-gath">
    <description>possession of the wine-press, the birthplace of the prophet Micah (1:14), who is called the "Morasthite" (<reflink target="XXX">Jer. 26:18</reflink>). This place was probably a suburb of Gath.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Moriah">
    <description>the chosen of Jehovah. Some contend that Mount Gerizim is meant, but most probably we are to regard this as one of the hills of Jerusalem. Here Solomon's temple was built, on the spot that had been the threshing-floor of Ornan the Jebusite (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 24:24, 25; 2 Chr. 3:1</reflink>). It is usually included in Zion, to the north-east of which it lay, and from which it was separated by the Tyropoean valley. This was "the land of Moriah" to which Abraham went to offer up his son Isaac (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 22:2</reflink>). It has been supposed that the highest point of the temple hill, which is now covered by the Mohammedan Kubbetes-Sakhrah, or "Dome of the Rock," is the actual site of Araunah's threshing-floor. Here also, one thousand years after Abraham, David built an altar and offered sacrifices to God. (<see target="x-self">See JERUSALEM; NUMBERING THE PEOPLE.</see>)</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Mortar">
    <description>(Heb. homer), cement of lime and sand (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 11:3; Ex. 1:14</reflink>); also potter's clay (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 41:25; Nah. 3:14</reflink>). Also Heb. 'aphar, usually rendered "dust," clay or mud used for cement in building (<reflink target="XXX">Lev. 14:42, 45</reflink>).</description>
    <description>Mortar for pulverizing (<reflink target="XXX">Prov. 27:22</reflink>) grain or other substances by means of a pestle instead of a mill. Mortars were used in the wilderness for pounding the manna (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 11:8</reflink>). It is commonly used in Palestine at the present day to pound wheat, from which the Arabs make a favourite dish called kibby.</description>

  <item id="Mosera">
    <description>a bond, one of the stations of the Israelites in the wilderness (<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 10:6</reflink>), at the foot of Mount Hor. (<reflink target="XXX">Comp. Num. 33:37, 38</reflink>). It has been identified with el-Tayibeh, a small fountain at the bottom of the pass leading to the ascent of Mount Hor.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Moseroth">
    <description>bonds, one of the stations in the wilderness (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 33:30, 31</reflink>), probably the same as Mosera.</description>

  <item id="Moses">
    <description>drawn (or Egypt. mesu, "son;" hence Rameses, royal son). On the invitation of Pharaoh (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 45:17-25</reflink>), Jacob and his sons went down into Egypt. This immigration took place probably about 350 years before the birth of Moses. Some centuries before Joseph, Egypt had been conquered by a pastoral Semitic race from Asia, the Hyksos, who brought into cruel subjection the native Egyptians, who were an African race. Jacob and his retinue were accustomed to a shepherd's life, and on their arrival in Egypt were received with favour by the king, who assigned them the "best of the land", the land of Goshen, to dwell in. The Hyksos or "shepherd" king who thus showed favour to Joseph and his family was in all probability the Pharaoh Apopi (or Apopis).</description>
    <description>Thus favoured, the Israelites began to "multiply exceedingly" (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 47:27</reflink>), and extended to the west and south. At length the supremacy of the Hyksos came to an end. The descendants of Jacob were allowed to retain their possession of Goshen undisturbed, but after the death of Joseph their position was not so favourable. The Egyptians began to despise them, and the period of their "affliction" (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 15:13</reflink>) commenced. They were sorely oppressed. They continued, however, to increase in numbers, and "the land was filled with them" (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 1:7</reflink>). The native Egyptians regarded them with suspicion, so that they felt all the hardship of a struggle for existence.</description>
    <description>In process of time "a king [probably Seti I.] arose who knew not Joseph" (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 1:8</reflink>). (<see target="x-self">See PHARAOH.</see>) The circumstances of the country were such that this king thought it necessary to weaken his Israelite subjects by oppressing them, and by degrees reducing their number. They were accordingly made public slaves, and were employed in connection with his numerous buildings, especially in the erection of store-cities, temples, and palaces. The children of Israel were made to serve with rigour. Their lives were made bitter with hard bondage, and "all their service, wherein they made them serve, was with rigour" (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 1:13, 14</reflink>). But this cruel oppression had not the result expected of reducing their number. On the contrary, "the more the Egyptians afflicted them, the more they multiplied and grew" (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 1:12</reflink>).</description>
    <description>The king next tried, through a compact secretly made with the guild of midwives, to bring about the destruction of all the Hebrew male children that might be born. But the king's wish was not rigorously enforced; the male children were spared by the midwives, so that "the people multiplied" more than ever. Thus baffled, the king issued a public proclamation calling on the people to put to death all the Hebrew male children by casting them into the river (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 1:22</reflink>). But neither by this edict was the king's purpose effected.</description>
    <description>One of the Hebrew households into which this cruel edict of the king brought great alarm was that of Amram, of the family of the Kohathites (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 6:16-20</reflink>), who with his wife Jochebed and two children, Miriam, a girl of perhaps fifteen years of age, and Aaron, a boy of three years, resided in or near Memphis, the capital city of that time. In this quiet home a male child was born (B.C. 1571). His mother concealed him in the house for three months from the knowledge of the civic authorities. But when the task of concealment became difficult, Jochebed contrived to bring her child under the notice of the daughter of the king by constructing for him an ark of bulrushes, which she laid among the flags which grew on the edge of the river at the spot where the princess was wont to come down and bathe. Her plan was successful. The king's daughter "saw the child; and behold the child wept." The princess (<see target="x-self">see PHARAOH'S DAUGHTER [1]</see>) sent Miriam, who was standing by, to fetch a nurse. She went and brought the mother of the child, to whom the princess said, "Take this child away, and nurse it for me, and I will give thee thy wages." Thus Jochebed's child, whom the princess called "Moses", i.e., "Saved from the water" (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 2:10</reflink>), was ultimately restored to her.</description>
    <description>As soon as the natural time for weaning the child had come, he was transferred from the humble abode of his father to the royal palace, where he was brought up as the adopted son of the princess, his mother probably accompanying him and caring still for him. He grew up amid all the grandeur and excitement of the Egyptian court, maintaining, however, probably a constant fellowship with his mother, which was of the highest importance as to his religious belief and his interest in his "brethren." His education would doubtless be carefully attended to, and he would enjoy all the advantages of training both as to his body and his mind. He at length became "learned in all the wisdom of the Egyptians" (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 7:22</reflink>). Egypt had then two chief seats of learning, or universities, at one of which, probably that of Heliopolis, his education was completed. Moses, being now about twenty years of age, spent over twenty more before he came into prominence in Bible history. These twenty years were probably spent in military service. There is a tradition recorded by Josephus that he took a lead in the war which was then waged between Egypt and Ethiopia, in which he gained renown as a skilful general, and became "mighty in deeds" (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 7:22</reflink>).</description>
    <description>After the termination of the war in Ethiopia, Moses returned to the Egyptian court, where he might reasonably have expected to be loaded with honours and enriched with wealth. But "beneath the smooth current of his life hitherto, a life of alternate luxury at the court and comparative hardness in the camp and in the discharge of his military duties, there had lurked from childhood to youth, and from youth to manhood, a secret discontent, perhaps a secret ambition. Moses, amid all his Egyptian surroundings, had never forgotten, had never wished to forget, that he was a Hebrew." He now resolved to make himself acquainted with the condition of his countrymen, and "went out unto his brethren, and looked upon their burdens" (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 2:11</reflink>). This tour of inspection revealed to him the cruel oppression and bondage under which they everywhere groaned, and could not fail to press on him the serious consideration of his duty regarding them. The time had arrived for his making common cause with them, that he might thereby help to break their yoke of bondage. He made his choice accordingly (<reflink target="XXX">Heb. 11:25-27</reflink>), assured that God would bless his resolution for the welfare of his people. He now left the palace of the king and took up his abode, probably in his father's house, as one of the Hebrew people who had for forty years been suffering cruel wrong at the hands of the Egyptians.</description>
    <description>He could not remain indifferent to the state of things around him, and going out one day among the people, his indignation was roused against an Egyptian who was maltreating a Hebrew. He rashly lifted up his hand and slew the Egyptian, and hid his body in the sand. Next day he went out again and found two Hebrews striving together. He speedily found that the deed of the previous day was known. It reached the ears of Pharaoh (the "great Rameses," Rameses II.), who "sought to slay Moses" (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 2:15</reflink>). Moved by fear, Moses fled from Egypt, and betook himself to the land of Midian, the southern part of the peninsula of Sinai, probably by much the same route as that by which, forty years afterwards, he led the Israelites to Sinai. He was providentially led to find a new home with the family of Reuel, where he remained for forty years (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 7:30</reflink>), under training unconsciously for his great life's work.</description>
    <description>Suddenly the angel of the Lord appeared to him in the burning bush (Ex. 3), and commissioned him to go down to Egypt and "bring forth the children of Israel" out of bondage. He was at first unwilling to go, but at length he was obedient to the heavenly vision, and left the land of Midian (4:18-26). On the way he was met by Aaron (q.v.) and the elders of Israel (27-31). He and Aaron had a hard task before them; but the Lord was with them (ch. 7-12), and the ransomed host went forth in triumph. (<see target="x-self">See EXODUS.</see>) After an eventful journey to and fro in the wilderness, we see them at length encamped in the plains of Moab, ready to cross over the Jordan into the Promised Land. There Moses addressed the assembled elders (<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 1:1-4; 5:1-26:19; 27:11-30:20</reflink>), and gives the people his last counsels, and then rehearses the great song (Deut. 32), clothing in fitting words the deep emotions of his heart at such a time, and in review of such a marvellous history as that in which he had acted so conspicious a part. Then, after blessing the tribes (33), he ascends to "the mountain of Nebo (q.v.), to the top of Pisgah, that is over against Jericho" (34:1), and from thence he surveys the land. "Jehovah shewed him all the land of Gilead, unto Dan, and all Naphtali, and the land of Ephraim, and Manasseh, and all the land of Judah, unto the utmost sea, and the south, and the plain of the valley of Jericho, the city of palm trees, unto Zoar" (<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 34:2-3</reflink>), the magnificient inheritance of the tribes of whom he had been so long the leader; and there he died, being one hundred and twenty years old, according to the word of the Lord, and was buried by the Lord "in a valley in the land of Moab, over against Beth-peor" (34:6). The people mourned for him during thirty days.</description>
    <description>Thus died "Moses the man of God" (<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 33:1; Josh. 14:6</reflink>). He was distinguished for his meekness and patience and firmness, and "he endured as seeing him who is invisible." "There arose not a prophet since in Israel like unto Moses, whom the Lord knew face to face, in all the signs and the wonders, which the Lord sent him to do in the land of Egypt to Pharaoh, and to all his servants, and to all his land, and in all that mighty hand, and in all the great terror which Moses shewed in the sight of all Israel" (<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 34:10-12</reflink>).</description>
    <description>The name of Moses occurs frequently in the Psalms and Prophets as the chief of the prophets.</description>
    <description>In the New Testament he is referred to as the representative of the law and as a type of Christ (<reflink target="XXX">John 1:17; 2 Cor. 3:13-18; Heb. 3:5, 6</reflink>). Moses is the only character in the Old Testament to whom Christ likens himself (<reflink target="XXX">John 5:46; comp. Deut. 18:15, 18, 19; Acts 7:37</reflink>). In Heb. 3:1-19 this likeness to Moses is set forth in various particulars.</description>
    <description>In Jude 1:9 mention is made of a contention between Michael and the devil about the body of Moses. This dispute is supposed to have had reference to the concealment of the body of Moses so as to prevent idolatry.</description>

  <item id="Mote">
    <description>(Gr. karphos, something dry, hence a particle of wood or chaff, etc.). A slight moral defect is likened to a mote (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 7:3-5; Luke 6:41, 42</reflink>).</description>

  <item id="Moth">
    <description>Heb. 'ash, from a root meaning "to fall away," as moth-eaten garments fall to pieces (<reflink target="XXX">Job 4:19; 13:28; Isa. 50:9; 51:8; Hos. 5:12</reflink>).</description>
    <description>Gr. ses, thus rendered in Matt. 6:19, 20; Luke 12:33. Allusion is thus made to the destruction of clothing by the larvae of the clothes-moth. This is the only lepidopterous insect referred to in Scripture.</description>

  <item id="Mouldy">
    <description>Of the Gibeonites it is said that "all the bread of their provision was dry and mouldy" (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 9:5, 12</reflink>). The Hebrew word here rendered "mouldy" (nikuddim) is rendered "cracknels" in 1 Kings 14:3, and denotes a kind of crisp cake. The meaning is that the bread of the Gibeonites had become dry and hard, hard as biscuits, and thus was an evidence of the length of the journey they had travelled.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Mount">
    <description>Palestine is a hilly country (<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 3:25; 11:11; Ezek. 34:13</reflink>). West of Jordan the mountains stretch from Lebanon far down into Galilee, terminating in Carmel. The isolated peak of Tabor rises from the elevated plain of Esdraelon, which, in the south, is shut in by hills spreading over the greater part of Samaria. The mountains of Western and Middle Palestine do not extend to the sea, but gently slope into plains, and toward the Jordan fall down into the Ghor.</description>
    <description>East of the Jordan the Anti-Lebanon, stretching south, terminates in the hilly district called Jebel Heish, which reaches down to the Sea of Gennesareth. South of the river Hieromax there is again a succession of hills, which are traversed by wadies running toward the Jordan. These gradually descend to a level at the river Arnon, which was the boundary of the ancient trans-Jordanic territory toward the south.</description>
    <description>The composition of the Palestinian hills is limestone, with occasional strata of chalk, and hence the numerous caves, some of large extent, found there.</description>

  <item id="Mount of the congregation">
    <description>only in Isa. 14:13, a mythic mountain of the Babylonians, regarded by them as the seat of the gods. It was situated in the far north, and in Babylonian inscriptions is described as a mountain called Im-Kharasak, "the mighty mountain of Bel, whose head reaches heaven, whose root is the holy deep." In their geography they are said to have identified it with mount El-wend, near Ecbatana.</description>

  <item id="Mount of the valley">
    <description>(<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 13:19</reflink>), a district in the east of Jordan, in the territory of Reuben. The "valley" here was probably the Ghor or valley of the Jordan, and hence the "mount" would be the hilly region in the north end of the Dead Sea. (See ZARETH-SHAHAR</description>

  <item id="Mourn">
    <description>Frequent references are found in Scripture to, (1.) Mourning for the dead. Abraham mourned for Sarah (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 23:2</reflink>); Jacob for Joseph (37:34, 35); the Egyptians for Jacob (50:3-10); Israel for Aaron (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 20:29</reflink>), for Moses (<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 34:8</reflink>), and for Samuel (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 25:1</reflink>); David for Abner (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 3:31, 35</reflink>); Mary and Martha for Lazarus (John 11); devout men for Stephen (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 8:2</reflink>), etc.</description>
    <description>(2.) For calamities, Job (1:20, 21; 2:8); Israel (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 33:4</reflink>); the Ninevites (<reflink target="XXX">Jonah 3:5</reflink>); Israel, when defeated by Benjamin (<reflink target="XXX">Judg. 20:26</reflink>), etc.</description>
    <description>(3.) Penitential mourning, by the Israelites on the day of atonement (<reflink target="XXX">Lev. 23:27; Acts 27:9</reflink>); under Samuel's ministry (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 7:6</reflink>); predicted in Zechariah (<reflink target="XXX">Zech. 12:10, 11</reflink>); in many of the psalms (51, etc.).</description>
    <description>Mourning was expressed, (1) by weeping (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 35:8, marg.; Luke 7:38, etc.</reflink>); (2) by loud lamentation (<reflink target="XXX">Ruth 1:9; 1 Sam. 6:19; 2 Sam. 3:31</reflink>); (3) by the disfigurement of the person, as rending the clothes (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 37:29, 34; Matt. 26:65</reflink>), wearing sackcloth (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 37:34; Ps. 35:13</reflink>), sprinkling dust or ashes on the person (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 13:19; Jer. 6:26; Job 2:12</reflink>), shaving the head and plucking out the hair of the head or beard (<reflink target="XXX">Lev. 10:6; Job 1:20</reflink>), neglect of the person or the removal of ornaments (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 33:4; Deut. 21:12, 13; 2 Sam. 14:2; 19:24; Matt. 6:16, 17</reflink>), fasting (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 1:12</reflink>), covering the upper lip (<reflink target="XXX">Lev. 13:45; Micah 3:7</reflink>), cutting the flesh (<reflink target="XXX">Jer. 16:6, 7</reflink>), and sitting in silence (<reflink target="XXX">Judg. 20:26; 2 Sam. 12:16; 13:31; Job 1:20</reflink>).</description>
    <description>In the later times we find a class of mourners who could be hired to give by their loud lamentation the external tokens of sorrow (<reflink target="XXX">2 Chr. 35:25; Jer. 9:17; Matt. 9:23</reflink>).</description>
    <description>The period of mourning for the dead varied. For Jacob it was seventy days (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 50:3</reflink>); for Aaron (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 20:29</reflink>) and Moses (<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 34:8</reflink>) thirty days; and for Saul only seven days (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 31:13</reflink>). In 2 Sam. 3:31-35, we have a description of the great mourning for the death of Abner.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Mouse">
    <description>Heb. 'akhbar, "swift digger"), properly the dormouse, the field-mouse (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 6:4</reflink>). In Lev. 11:29, Isa. 66:17 this word is used generically, and includes the jerboa (Mus jaculus), rat, hamster (Cricetus), which, though declared to be unclean animals, were eaten by the Arabs, and are still eaten by the Bedouins. It is said that no fewer than twenty-three species of this group ('akhbar=Arab. ferah) of animals inhabit Palestine. God "laid waste" the people of Ashdod by the terrible visitation of field-mice, which are like locusts in their destructive effects (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 6:4, 11, 18</reflink>). Herodotus, the Greek historian, accounts for the destruction of the army of Sennacherib (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 19:35</reflink>) by saying that in the night thousands of mice invaded the camp and gnawed through the bow-strings, quivers, and shields, and thus left the Assyrians helpless. (See SENNACHERIB</description>

  <item id="Mowing">
    <description>(Heb. gez), rendered in Ps. 72:6 "mown grass." The expression "king's mowings" (<reflink target="XXX">Amos 7:1</reflink>) refers to some royal right of early pasturage, the first crop of grass for the cavalry (comp. 1 Kings 18:5).</description>

  </item>
  <item id="Mulberry">
    <description>Heb. bakah, "to weep;" rendered "Baca" (R.V., "weeping") in Ps. 84:6. The plural form of the Hebrew bekaim is rendered "mulberry trees" in 2 Sam. 5:23, 24 and 1 Chr. 14:14, 15. The tree here alluded to was probably the aspen or trembling poplar. "We know with certainty that the black poplar, the aspen, and the Lombardy poplar grew in Palestine. The aspen, whose long leaf-stalks cause the leaves to tremble with every breath of wind, unites with the willow and the oak to overshadow the watercourses of the Lebanon, and with the oleander and the acacia to adorn the ravines of Southern Palestine" (Kitto). By "the sound of a going in the tops of the mulberry trees" we are to understand a rustling among the trees like the marching of an army. This was the signal that the Lord himself would lead forth David's army to victory. (<see target="x-self">See SYCAMINE.</see>)</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Mule">
    <description>(Heb. pered), so called from the quick step of the animal or its power of carrying loads. It is not probable that the Hebrews bred mules, as this was strictly forbidden in the law (<reflink target="XXX">Lev. 19:19</reflink>), although their use was not forbidden. We find them in common use even by kings and nobles (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 18:9; 1 Kings 1:33; 2 Kings 5:17; Ps. 32:9</reflink>). They are not mentioned, however, till the time of David, for the word rendered "mules" (R.V. correctly, "hot springs") in Gen. 36:24 (yemim) properly denotes the warm springs of Callirhoe, on the eastern shore of the Dead Sea. In David's reign they became very common (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 13:29; 1 Kings 10:25</reflink>).</description>
    <description>Mules are not mentioned in the New Testament. Perhaps they had by that time ceased to be used in Palestine.</description>

  <item id="Murder">
    <description>Wilful murder was distinguished from accidental homicide, and was invariably visited with capital punishment (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 35:16, 18, 21, 31; Lev. 24:17</reflink>). This law in its principle is founded on the fact of man's having been made in the likeness of God (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 9:5, 6; John 8:44; 1 John 3:12, 15</reflink>). The Mosiac law prohibited any compensation for murder or the reprieve of the murderer (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 21:12, 14; Deut. 19:11, 13; 2 Sam. 17:25; 20:10</reflink>). Two witnesses were required in any capital case (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 35:19-30; Deut. 17:6-12</reflink>). If the murderer could not be discovered, the city nearest the scene of the murder was required to make expiation for the crime committed (<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 21:1-9</reflink>). These offences also were to be punished with death, (1) striking a parent; (2) cursing a parent; (3) kidnapping (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 21:15-17; Deut. 27:16</reflink>).</description>

  <item id="Murmuring">
    <description>of the Hebrews in the wilderness, called forth the displeasure of God, which was only averted by the earnest prayer of Moses (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 11:33, 34; 12; 14:27, 30, 31; 16:3; 21:4-6; Ps. 106:25</reflink>). Forbidden by Paul (<reflink target="XXX">1 Cor. 10:10</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Murrain">
    <description>Heb. deber, "destruction," a "great mortality", the fifth plague that fell upon the Egyptians (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 9:3</reflink>). It was some distemper that resulted in the sudden and widespread death of the cattle. It was confined to the cattle of the Egyptians that were in the field (9:6).</description>

  <item id="Mushi">
    <description>receding, the second of the two sons of Merari (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 6:19; Num. 3:20</reflink>). His sons were called Mushites (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 3:33; 26:58</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Music">
    <description>Jubal was the inventor of musical instruments (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 4:21</reflink>). The Hebrews were much given to the cultivation of music. Their whole history and literature afford abundant evidence of this. After the Deluge, the first mention of music is in the account of Laban's interview with Jacob (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 31:27</reflink>). After their triumphal passage of the Red Sea, Moses and the children of Israel sang their song of deliverance (Ex. 15).</description>
    <description>But the period of Samuel, David, and Solomon was the golden age of Hebrew music, as it was of Hebrew poetry. Music was now for the first time systematically cultivated. It was an essential part of training in the schools of the prophets (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 10:5; 19:19-24; 2 Kings 3:15; 1 Chr. 25:6</reflink>). There now arose also a class of professional singers (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 19:35; Eccl. 2:8</reflink>). The temple, however, was the great school of music. In the conducting of its services large bands of trained singers and players on instruments were constantly employed (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 6:5; 1 Chr. 15; 16; 23;5; 25:1-6</reflink>).</description>
    <description>In private life also music seems to have held an important place among the Hebrews (<reflink target="XXX">Eccl. 2:8; Amos 6:4-6; Isa. 5:11, 12; 24:8, 9; Ps. 137; Jer. 48:33; Luke 15:25</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Music, Instrumental">
    <description>Among instruments of music used by the Hebrews a principal place is given to stringed instruments. These were, (1.) The kinnor, the "harp." (2.) The nebel, "a skin bottle," rendered "psaltery." (3.) The sabbeka, or "sackbut," a lute or lyre. (4.) The gittith, occurring in the title of Ps. 8; 8; 84. (5.) Minnim (<reflink target="XXX">Ps. 150:4</reflink>), rendered "stringed instruments;" in Ps. 45:8, in the form _minni_, probably the apocopated (i.e., shortened) plural, rendered, Authorized Version, "whereby," and in the Revised Version "stringed instruments." (6.) Machalath, in the titles of Ps. 53 and 88; supposed to be a kind of lute or guitar.</description>
    <description>Of wind instruments mention is made of, (1.) The 'ugab (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 4:21; Job 21:12; 30:31</reflink>), probably the so-called Pan's pipes or syrinx. (2.) The qeren or "horn" (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 6:5; 1 Chr. 25:5</reflink>). (3.) The shophar, rendered "trumpet" (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 6:4, 6, 8</reflink>). The word means "bright," and may have been so called from the clear, shrill sound it emitted. It was often used (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 19:13; Num. 10:10; Judg. 7:16, 18; 1 Sam. 13:3</reflink>). (4.) The hatsotserah, or straight trumpet (<reflink target="XXX">Ps. 98:6; Num. 10:1-10</reflink>). This name is supposed by some to be an onomatopoetic word, intended to imitate the pulse-like sound of the trumpet, like the Latin taratantara. Some have identified it with the modern trombone. (5.) The halil, i.e, "bored through," a flute or pipe (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 10:5; 1 Kings 1:40; Isa. 5:12; Jer. 48:36</reflink>) which is still used in Palestine. (6.) The sumponyah, rendered "dulcimer" (<reflink target="XXX">Dan. 3:5</reflink>), probably a sort of bagpipe. (7.) The maskrokith'a (<reflink target="XXX">Dan. 3:5</reflink>), rendered "flute," but its precise nature is unknown.</description>
    <description>Of instruments of percussion mention is made of, (1.) The toph, an instrument of the drum kind, rendered "timbrel" (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 15:20; Job 21:12; Ps. 68:25</reflink>); also "tabret" (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 31:27; Isa. 24:8; 1 Sam. 10:5</reflink>). (2.) The paamon, the "bells" on the robe of the high priest (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 28:33; 39:25</reflink>). (3.) The tseltselim, "cymbals" (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 6:5; Ps. 150:5</reflink>), which are struck together and produce a loud, clanging sound. Metsilloth, "bells" on horses and camels for ornament, and metsiltayim, "cymbals" (<reflink target="XXX">1 Chr. 13:8; Ezra 3:10, etc.</reflink>). These words are all derived from the same root, tsalal, meaning "to tinkle." (4.) The menaan'im, used only in 2 Sam. 6:5, rendered "cornets" (R.V., "castanets"); in the Vulgate, "sistra," an instrument of agitation. (5.) The shalishim, mentioned only in 1 Sam. 18:6, rendered "instruments of music" (marg. of R.V., "triangles or three-stringed instruments").</description>
    <description>The words in Eccl. 2:8, "musical instruments, and that of all sorts," Authorized Version, are in the Revised Version "concubines very many."</description>

  <item id="Musician, Chief">
    <description>(Heb. menatstseah), the precentor of the Levitical choir or orchestra in the temple, mentioned in the titles of fifty-five psalms, and in Hab. 3:19, Revised Version. The first who held this office was Jeduthun (<reflink target="XXX">1 Chr. 16:41</reflink>), and the office appears to have been hereditary. Heman and Asaph were his two colleagues (<reflink target="XXX">2 Chr. 35:15</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Mustard">
    <description>a plant of the genus sinapis, a pod-bearing, shrub-like plant, growing wild, and also cultivated in gardens. The little round seeds were an emblem of any small insignificant object. It is not mentioned in the Old Testament; and in each of the three instances of its occurrence in the New Testament (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 13:31, 32; Mark 4:31, 32; Luke 13:18, 19</reflink>) it is spoken of only with reference to the smallness of its seed. The common mustard of Palestine is the Sinapis nigra. This garden herb sometimes grows to a considerable height, so as to be spoken of as "a tree" as compared with garden herbs.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Muth-labben">
    <description>occurring only in the title of Psalm 9. Some interpret the words as meaning "on the death of Labben," some unknown person. Others render the word, "on the death of the son;" i.e., of Absalom (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 18:33</reflink>). Others again have taken the word as the name of a musical instrument, or as the name of an air to which the psalm was sung.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Muzzle">
    <description>Grain in the East is usually thrashed by the sheaves being spread out on a floor, over which oxen and cattle are driven to and fro, till the grain is trodden out. Moses ordained that the ox was not to be muzzled while thrashing. It was to be allowed to eat both the grain and the straw (<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 25:4</reflink>).

  <item id="Myra">
    <description>one of the chief towns of Lycia, in Asia Minor, about 2 1/2 miles from the coast (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 27:5</reflink>). Here Paul removed from the Adramyttian ship in which he had sailed from Caesarea, and entered into the Alexandrian ship, which was afterwards wrecked at Melita (27:39-44).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Myrrh">
    <description>Heb. mor. (1.) First mentioned as a principal ingredient in the holy anointing oil (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 30:23</reflink>). It formed part of the gifts brought by the wise men from the east, who came to worship the infant Jesus (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 2:11</reflink>). It was used in embalming (<reflink target="XXX">John 19:39</reflink>), also as a perfume (<reflink target="XXX">Esther 2:12; Ps. 45:8; Prov. 7:17</reflink>). It was a custom of the Jews to give those who were condemned to death by crucifixion "wine mingled with myrrh" to produce insensibility. This drugged wine was probably partaken of by the two malefactors, but when the Roman soldiers pressed it upon Jesus "he received it not" (<reflink target="XXX">Mark 15:23</reflink>). (<see target="x-self">See GALL.</see>)</description>
    <description>This was the gum or viscid white liquid which flows from a tree resembling the acacia, found in Africa and Arabia, the Balsamodendron myrrha of botanists. The "bundle of myrrh" in Cant. 1:13 is rather a "bag" of myrrh or a scent-bag.</description>
    <description>(2.) Another word _lot_ is also translated "myrrh" (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 37:25; 43:11; R.V., marg., "or ladanum"</reflink>). What was meant by this word is uncertain. It has been thought to be the chestnut, mastich, stacte, balsam, turpentine, pistachio nut, or the lotus. It is probably correctly rendered by the Latin word ladanum, the Arabic ladan, an aromatic juice of a shrub called the Cistus or rock rose, which has the same qualities, though in a slight degree, of opium, whence a decoction of opium is called laudanum. This plant was indigenous to Syria and Arabia.</description>

  <item id="Myrtle">
    <description>(<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 41:19; Neh. 8:15; Zech. 1:8</reflink>), Hebrew hadas, known in the East by the name _as_, the Myrtus communis of the botanist. "Although no myrtles are now found on the mount (of Olives), excepting in the gardens, yet they still exist in many of the glens about Jerusalem, where we have often seen its dark shining leaves and white flowers. There are many near Bethlehem and about Hebron, especially near Dewir Dan, the ancient Debir. It also sheds its fragrance on the sides of Carmel and of Tabor, and fringes the clefts of the Leontes in its course through Galilee. We meet with it all through Central Palestine" (Tristram).</description>

  <item id="Naaman">
    <description>pleasantness, a Syrian, the commander of the armies of Benhadad II. in the time of Joram, king of Israel. He was afflicted with leprosy; and when the little Hebrew slave-girl that waited on his wife told her of a prophet in Samaria who could cure her master, he obtained a letter from Benhadad and proceeded with it to Joram. The king of Israel suspected in this some evil design against him, and rent his clothes. Elisha the prophet hearing of this, sent for Naaman, and the strange interview which took place is recorded in 2 Kings 5. The narrative contains all that is known of the Syrian commander. He was cured of his leprosy by dipping himself seven times in the Jordan, according to the word of Elisha. His cure is alluded to by our Lord (<reflink target="XXX">Luke 4:27</reflink>).</description>

  <item id="Nabal">
    <description>foolish, a descendant of Caleb who dwelt at Maon (1 Sam. 25), the modern Main, 7 miles south-east of Hebron. He was "very great, and he had 3,000 sheep and 1,000 goats...but the man was churlish and evil in his doings." During his wanderings David came into that district, and hearing that Nabal was about to shear his sheep, he sent ten of his young men to ask "whatsoever cometh unto thy hand for thy servants." Nabal insultingly resented the demand, saying, "Who is David, and who is the son of Jesse?" (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 25:10, 11</reflink>). One of the shepherds that stood by and saw the reception David's messengers had met with, informed Abigail, Nabal's wife, who at once realized the danger that threatened her household. She forthwith proceeded to the camp of David, bringing with her ample stores of provisions (25:18). She so courteously and persuasively pled her cause that David's anger was appeased, and he said to her, "Blessed be the Lord God of Israel which sent thee this day to meet me."</description>
    <description>On her return she found her husband incapable from drunkenness of understanding the state of matters, and not till the following day did she explain to him what had happened. He was stunned by a sense of the danger to which his conduct had exposed him. "His heart died within him, and he became as a stone." and about ten days after "the Lord smote Nabal that he died" (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 25:37, 38</reflink>). Not long after David married Abigail (q.v.).</description>

  <item id="Naboth">
    <description>fruits, "the Jezreelite," was the owner of a portion of ground on the eastern slope of the hill of Jezreel (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 9:25, 26</reflink>). This small "plat of ground" seems to have been all he possessed. It was a vineyard, and lay "hard by the palace of Ahab" (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 21:1, 2</reflink>), who greatly coveted it. Naboth, however, refused on any terms to part with it to the king. He had inherited it from his fathers, and no Israelite could lawfully sell his property (<reflink target="XXX">Lev. 25:23</reflink>). Jezebel, Ahab's wife, was grievously offended at Naboth's refusal to part with his vineyard. By a crafty and cruel plot she compassed his death. His sons also shared his fate (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 9:26; 1 Kings 21:19</reflink>). She then came to Ahab and said, "Arise, take possession of the vineyard; for Naboth is not alive, but dead." Ahab arose and went forth into the garden which had so treacherously and cruelly been acquired, seemingly enjoying his new possession, when, lo, Elijah suddenly appeared before him and pronounced against him a fearful doom (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 21:17-24</reflink>). Jehu and Bidcar were with Ahab at this time, and so deeply were the words of Elijah imprinted on Jehu's memory that many years afterwards he refers to them (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 9:26</reflink>), and he was the chief instrument in inflicting this sentence on Ahab and Jezebel and all their house (9:30-37). The house of Ahab was extinguished by him. Not one of all his great men and his kinsfolk and his priests did Jehu spare (10:11).</description>
    <description>Ahab humbled himself at Elijah's words (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 21:28, 29</reflink>), and therefore the prophecy was fulfilled not in his fate but in that of his son Joram (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 9:25</reflink>).</description>
    <description>The history of Naboth, compared with that of Ahab and Jezebel, furnishes a remarkable illustration of the law of a retributive providence, a law which runs through all history (<reflink target="XXX">comp. Ps. 109:17, 18</reflink>).</description>

  <item id="Nadab">
    <description>liberal, generous. (1.) The eldest of Aaron's four sons (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 6:23; Num. 3:2</reflink>). He with his brothers and their father were consecrated as priests of Jehovah (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 28:1</reflink>). He afterwards perished with Abihu for the sin of offering strange fire on the altar of burnt-offering (<reflink target="XXX">Lev. 10:1,2; Num. 3:4; 26:60</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(2.) The son and successor of Jeroboam, the king of Israel (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 14:20</reflink>). While engaged with all Israel in laying siege to Gibbethon, a town of southern Dan (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 19:44</reflink>), a conspiracy broke out in his army, and he was slain by Baasha (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 15:25-28</reflink>), after a reign of two years (B.C. 955-953). The assassination of Nadab was followed by that of his whole house, and thus this great Ephraimite family became extinct (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 15:29</reflink>).</description>

  </item>
  <item id="Nahash">
    <description>serpent. (1.) King of the Ammonites in the time of Saul. The inhabitants of Jabesh-Gilead having been exposed to great danger from Nahash, sent messengers to Gibeah to inform Saul of their extremity. He promptly responded to the call, and gathering together an army he marched against Nahash. "And it came to pass that they which remained were scattered, so that two of them [the Ammonites] were not left together" (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 11:1-11</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(2.) Another king of the Ammonites of the same name is mentioned, who showed kindness to David during his wanderings (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 10:2</reflink>). On his death David sent an embassy of sympathy to Hanun, his son and successor, at Rabbah Ammon, his capital. The grievous insult which was put upon these ambassadors led to a war against the Ammonites, who, with their allies the Syrians, were completely routed in a battle fought at "the entering in of the gate," probably of Medeba (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 10:6-14</reflink>). Again Hadarezer rallied the Syrian host, which was totally destroyed by the Israelite army under Joab in a decisive battle fought at Helam (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 10:17</reflink>), near to Hamath (<reflink target="XXX">1 Chr. 18:3</reflink>). "So the Syrians feared to help the children of Ammon any more" (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 10:19</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(3.) The father of Amasa, who was commander-in-chief of Abasolom's army (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 17:25</reflink>). Jesse's wife had apparently been first married to this man, to whom she bore Abigail and Zeruiah, who were thus David's sisters, but only on the mother's side (<reflink target="XXX">1 Chr. 2:16</reflink>).</description>

    <description>(2.) A son of Terah, and elder brother of Abraham (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 11:26, 27; Josh. 24:2, R.V.</reflink>). He married Milcah, the daughter of his brother Haran, and remained in the land of his nativity on the east of the river Euphrates at Haran (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 11:27-32</reflink>). A correspondence was maintained between the family of Abraham in Canaan and the relatives in the old ancestral home at Haran till the time of Jacob. When Jacob fled from Haran all intercourse between the two branches of the family came to an end (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 31:55</reflink>).

His sister Elisheba was the wife of Aaron. He died in the wilderness (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 26:64, 65</reflink>). His name occurs in the Greek form Naasson in the genealogy of Christ (Matt, 1:4; Luke 3:32).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Nahum">
    <description>consolation, the seventh of the so-called minor prophets, an Elkoshite. All we know of him is recorded in the book of his prophecies. He was probably a native of Galilee, and after the deportation of the ten tribes took up his residence in Jerusalem. Others think that Elkosh was the name of a place on the east bank of the Tigris, and that Nahum dwelt there.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Nahum, Book of">
    <description>Nahum prophesied, according to some, in the beginning of the reign of Ahaz (B.C. 743). Others, however, think that his prophecies are to be referred to the latter half of the reign of Hezekiah (about B.C. 709). This is the more probable opinion, internal evidences leading to that conclusion. Probably the book was written in Jerusalem (soon after B.C. 709), where he witnessed the invasion of Sennacherib and the destruction of his host (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 19:35</reflink>).</description>
    <description>The subject of this prophecy is the approaching complete and final destruction of Nineveh, the capital of the great and at that time flourishing Assyrian empire. Assur-bani-pal was at the height of his glory. Nineveh was a city of vast extent, and was then the centre of the civilzation and commerce of the world, a "bloody city all full of lies and robbery" (<reflink target="XXX">Nah. 3:1</reflink>), for it had robbed and plundered all the neighbouring nations. It was strongly fortified on every side, bidding defiance to every enemy; yet it was to be utterly destroyed as a punishment for the great wickedness of its inhabitants.</description>
    <description>Jonah had already uttered his message of warning, and Nahum was followed by Zephaniah, who also predicted (<reflink target="XXX">Zeph. 2:4-15</reflink>) the destruction of the city, predictions which were remarkably fulfilled (B.C. 625) when Nineveh was destroyed apparently by fire, and the Assyrian empire came to an end, an event which changed the face of Asia. (<see target="x-self">See NINEVEH.</see>)</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Nail">
    <description>for fastening. (1.) Hebrew yathed, "piercing," a peg or nail of any material (<reflink target="XXX">Ezek. 15:3</reflink>), more especially a tent-peg (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 27:19; 35:18; 38:20</reflink>), with one of which Jael (q.v.) pierced the temples of Sisera (<reflink target="XXX">Judg. 4:21, 22</reflink>). This word is also used metaphorically (<reflink target="XXX">Zech. 10:4</reflink>) for a prince or counsellor, just as "the battle-bow" represents a warrior.</description>
    <description>(2.) Masmer, a "point," the usual word for a nail. The words of the wise are compared to "nails fastened by the masters of assemblies" (<reflink target="XXX">Eccl. 12:11, A.V.</reflink>). The Revised Version reads, "as nails well fastened are the words of the masters," etc. Others (as Plumptre) read, "as nails fastened are the masters of assemblies" (<reflink target="XXX">comp. Isa. 22:23; Ezra 9:8</reflink>). David prepared nails for the temple (<reflink target="XXX">1 Chr. 22:3; 2 Chr. 3:9</reflink>). The nails by which our Lord was fixed to the cross are mentioned (<reflink target="XXX">John 20:25; Col. 2:14</reflink>).</description>
    <description>Nail of the finger (Heb. tsipporen, "scraping"). To "pare the nails" is in Deut. 21:12 (marg., "make," or "dress," or "suffer to grow") one of the signs of purification, separation from former heathenism (<reflink target="XXX">comp. Lev. 14:8; Num. 8:7</reflink>). In Jer. 17:1 this word is rendered "point."</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Nain">
    <description>(from Heb. nain, "green pastures," "lovely"), the name of a town near the gate of which Jesus raised to life a widow's son (<reflink target="XXX">Luke 7:11-17</reflink>). It is identified with the village called Nein, standing on the north-western slope of Jebel ed-Duhy (=the "hill Moreh" = "Little hermon"), about 4 miles from Tabor and 25 southwest of Capernaum. At the foot of the slope on which it stands is the great plain of Esdraelon.</description>
    <description>This was the first miracle of raising the dead our Lord had wrought, and it excited great awe and astonishment among the people.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Naioth">
    <description>dwellings, the name given to the prophetical college established by Samuel near Ramah. It consisted of a cluster of separate dwellings, and hence its name. David took refuge here when he fled from Saul (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 19:18, 19, 22, 23</reflink>), and here he passed a few weeks in peace (comp. Ps. 11). It was probably the common residence of the "sons of the prophets."</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Naked">
    <description>This word denotes (1) absolute nakedness (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 2:25; Job 1:21; Eccl. 5:15; Micah 1:8; Amos 2:16</reflink>); (2) being poorly clad (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 58:7; James 2:15</reflink>). It denotes also (3) the state of one who has laid aside his loose outer garment (Lat. nudus), and appears clothed only in a long tunic or under robe worn next the skin (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 19:24; Isa. 47:3; comp. Mark 14:52; John 21:7</reflink>). It is used figuratively, meaning "being discovered" or "made manifest" (<reflink target="XXX">Job 26:6; Heb. 4:13</reflink>). In Ex. 32:25 the expression "the people were naked" (A.V.) is more correctly rendered in the Revised Version "the people were broken loose", i.e., had fallen into a state of lawlessness and insubordination. In 2 Chr. 28:19 the words "he made Judah naked" (A.V.), but Revised Version "he had dealt wantonly in Judah," mean "he had permitted Judah to break loose from all the restraints of religion."</description>

  <item id="Naomi">
    <description>the lovable; my delight, the wife of Elimelech, and mother of Mahlon and Chilion, and mother-in-law of Ruth (1:2, 20, 21; 2:1). Elimelech and his wife left the district of Bethlehem-Judah, and found a new home in the uplands of Moab. In course of time he died, as also his two sons Mahlon and Chilion, who had married women of Moab, and three widows were left mourning the loss of their husbands. Naomi longs to return now to her own land, to Bethlehem. One of her widowed daughters-in-law, Ruth, accompanies her, and is at length married to Boaz (q.v.).</description>

  <item id="Naphish">

  </item>
  <item id="Naphtali">
    <description>my wrestling, the fifth son of Jacob. His mother was Bilhah, Rachel's handmaid (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 30:8</reflink>). When Jacob went down into Egypt, Naphtali had four sons (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 46:24</reflink>). Little is known of him as an individual.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Naphtali, Mount">
    <description>the mountainous district of Naphtali (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 20:7</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Naphtali, Tribe of">
    <description>On this tribe Jacob pronounced the patriarchal blessing, "Naphtali is a hind let loose: he giveth goodly words" (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 49:21</reflink>). It was intended thus to set forth under poetic imagery the future character and history of the tribe.</description>
    <description>At the time of the Exodus this tribe numbered 53,400 adult males (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 1:43</reflink>), but at the close of the wanderings they numbered only 45,400 (26:48-50). Along with Dan and Asher they formed "the camp of Dan," under a common standard (2:25-31), occupying a place during the march on the north side of the tabernacle.</description>
    <description>The possession assigned to this tribe is set forth in Josh. 19:32-39. It lay in the north-eastern corner of the land, bounded on the east by the Jordan and the lakes of Merom and Galilee, and on the north it extended far into Coele-Syria, the valley between the two Lebanon ranges. It comprehended a greater variety of rich and beautiful scenery and of soil and climate than fell to the lot of any other tribe. The territory of Naphtali extended to about 800 square miles, being the double of that of Issachar. The region around Kedesh, one of its towns, was originally called Galil, a name afterwards given to the whole northern division of Canaan. A large number of foreigners settled here among the mountains, and hence it was called "Galilee of the Gentiles" (q.v.), Matt. 4:15, 16. The southern portion of Naphtali has been called the "Garden of Palestine." It was of unrivalled fertility. It was the principal scene of our Lord's public ministry. Here most of his parables were spoken and his miracles wrought.</description>
    <description>This tribe was the first to suffer from the invasion of Benhadad, king of Syria, in the reigns of Baasha, king of Israel, and Asa, king of Judah (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 15:20; 2 Chr. 16:4</reflink>). In the reign of Pekah, king of Israel, the Assyrians under Tiglath-pileser swept over the whole north of Israel, and carried the people into captivity (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 15:29</reflink>). Thus the kingdom of Israel came to an end (B.C. 722).</description>
    <description>Naphtali is now almost wholly a desert, the towns of Tiberias, on the shore of the Lake of Galilee, and Safed being the only places in it of any importance.</description>

  <item id="Naphtuhim">
    <description>a Hamitic tribe descended from Mizraim (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 10:13</reflink>). Others identify this word with Napata, the name of the city and territory on the southern frontier of Mizraim, the modern Meroe, at the great bend of the Nile at Soudan. This city was the royal residence, it is said, of Queen Candace (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 8:27</reflink>). Here there are extensive and splendid ruins.</description>

  <item id="Napkin">
    <description>(Gr. soudarion, John 11:44; 20:7; Lat. sudarium, a "sweat-cloth"), a cloth for wiping the sweat from the face. But the word is used of a wrapper to fold money in (<reflink target="XXX">Luke 19:20</reflink>), and as an article of dress, a "handkerchief" worn on the head (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 19:12</reflink>).</description>

  </item>
  <item id="Nathan">
    <description>given. (1.) A prophet in the reigns of David and Solomon (<reflink target="XXX">2 Chr. 9:29</reflink>). He is first spoken of in connection with the arrangements David made for the building of the temple (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 7:2, 3, 17</reflink>), and next appears as the reprover of David on account of his sin with Bathsheba (12:1-14). He was charged with the education of Solomon (12:25), at whose inauguration to the throne he took a prominent part (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 1:8, 10, 11, 22-45</reflink>). His two sons, Zabad (<reflink target="XXX">1 Chr. 2:36</reflink>) and Azariah (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 4:5</reflink>) occupied places of honour at the king's court. He last appears in assisting David in reorganizing the public worship (<reflink target="XXX">2 Chr. 29:25</reflink>). He seems to have written a life of David, and also a life of Solomon (<reflink target="XXX">1 Chr. 29:29; 2 Chr. 9:29</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(2.) A son of David, by Bathsheba (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 5:14</reflink>), whose name appears in the genealogy of Mary, the mother of our Lord (<reflink target="XXX">Luke 3:31</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(3.) Ezra 8:16.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Nathanael">
    <description>given or gift of God, one of our Lord's disciples, "of Cana in Galilee" (<reflink target="XXX">John 21:2</reflink>). He was "an Israelite indeed, in whom was no guile" (1:47, 48). His name occurs only in the Gospel of John, who in his list of the disciples never mentions Bartholomew, with whom he has consequently been identified. He was one of those to whom the Lord showed himself alive after his resurrection, at the Sea of Tiberias.</description>

  <item id="Nativity of Christ">
    <description>The birth of our Lord took place at the time and place predicted by the prophets (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 49:10; Isa. 7:14; Jer. 31:15; Micah 5:2; Hag. 2:6-9; Dan. 9:24, 25</reflink>). Joseph and Mary were providentially led to go up to Bethlehem at this period, and there Christ was born (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 2:1, 6; Luke 2:1, 7</reflink>). The exact year or month or day of his birth cannot, however, now be exactly ascertained. We know, however, that it took place in the "fulness of the time" (<reflink target="XXX">Gal. 4:4</reflink>), i.e., at the fittest time in the world's history. Chronologists are now generally agreed that the year 4 before the Christian era was the year of Christ's nativity, and consequently that he was about four years old in the year 1 A.D.</description>

  <item id="Naughty figs">
    <description>(<reflink target="XXX">Jer. 24:2</reflink>). "The bad figs may have been such either from having decayed, and thus been reduced to a rotten condition, or as being the fruit of the sycamore, which contains a bitter juice" (Tristram, Nat. Hist.). The inferiority of the fruit is here referred to as an emblem of the rejected Zedekiah and his people.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Nazarene">
    <description>This epithet (Gr. Nazaraios) is applied to Christ only once (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 2:23</reflink>). In all other cases the word is rendered "of Nazareth" (<reflink target="XXX">Mark 1:24; 10:47; 14:67, etc.</reflink>). When this Greek designation was at first applied to our Lord, it was meant simply to denote the place of his residence. In course of time the word became a term of reproach. Thus the word "Nazarene" carries with it an allusion to those prophecies which speak of Christ as "despised of men" (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 53:3</reflink>). Some, however, think that in this name there is an allusion to the Hebrew _netser_, which signifies a branch or sprout. It is so applied to the Messiah (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 11:1</reflink>), i.e., he whom the prophets called the _Netse_, the "Branch."</description>
    <description>The followers of Christ were called "the sect of Nazarenes" (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 24:5</reflink>). All over Palestine and Syria this name is still given to Christians. (<see target="x-self">See NAZARETH.</see>)</description>

  <item id="Nazareth">
    <description>separated, generally supposed to be the Greek form of the Hebrew _netser_, a "shoot" or "sprout." Some, however, think that the name of the city must be connected with the name of the hill behind it, from which one of the finest prospects in Palestine is obtained, and accordingly they derive it from the Hebrew _notserah_, i.e., one guarding or watching, thus designating the hill which overlooks and thus guards an extensive region.</description>
    <description>This city is not mentioned in the Old Testament. It was the home of Joseph and Mary (<reflink target="XXX">Luke 2:39</reflink>), and here the angel announced to the Virgin the birth of the Messiah (1:26-28). Here Jesus grew up from his infancy to manhood (4:16); and here he began his public ministry in the synagogue (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 13:54</reflink>), at which the people were so offended that they sought to cast him down from the precipice whereon their city was built (<reflink target="XXX">Luke 4:29</reflink>). Twice they expelled him from their borders (4:16-29; Matt. 13:54-58); and he finally retired from the city, where he did not many mighty works because of their unbelief (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 13:58</reflink>), and took up his residence in Capernaum.</description>
    <description>Nazareth is situated among the southern ridges of Lebanon, on the steep slope of a hill, about 14 miles from the Sea of Galilee and about 6 west from Mount Tabor. It is identified with the modern village en-Nazirah, of six or ten thousand inhabitants. It lies "as in a hollow cup" lower down upon the hill than the ancient city. The main road for traffic between Egypt and the interior of Asia passed by Nazareth near the foot of Tabor, and thence northward to Damascus.</description>
    <description>It is supposed from the words of Nathanael in John 1:46 that the city of Nazareth was held in great disrepute, either because, it is said, the people of Galilee were a rude and less cultivated class, and were largely influenced by the Gentiles who mingled with them, or because of their lower type of moral and religious character. But there seems to be no sufficient reason for these suppositions. The Jews believed that, according to Micah 5:2, the birth of the Messiah would take place at Bethlehem, and nowhere else. Nathanael held the same opinion as his countrymen, and believed that the great "good" which they were all expecting could not come from Nazareth. This is probably what Nathanael meant. Moreover, there does not seem to be any evidence that the inhabitants of Galilee were in any respect inferior, or that a Galilean was held in contempt, in the time of our Lord. (<see target="x-self">See Dr. Merrill's Galilee in the Time of Christ.</see>)</description>
    <description>The population of this city (now about 10,000) in the time of Christ probably amounted to 15,000 or 20,000 souls.</description>
    <description>"The so-called 'Holy House' is a cave under the Latin church, which appears to have been originally a tank. The 'brow of the hill', site of the attempted precipitation, is probably the northern cliff: the traditional site has been shown since the middle ages at some distance to the south. None of the traditional sites are traceable very early, and they have no authority. The name Nazareth perhaps means 'a watch tower' (now en-Nasrah), but is connected in the New Testament with Netzer, 'a branch' (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 4:2; Jer. 23:5; Zech. 3:8; 6:12; Matt. 2:23</reflink>), Nazarene being quite a different word from Nazarite."</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Nazarite">
    <description>(Heb. form Nazirite), the name of such Israelites as took on them the vow prescribed in Num. 6:2-21. The word denotes generally one who is separated from others and consecrated to God. Although there is no mention of any Nazarite before Samson, yet it is evident that they existed before the time of Moses. The vow of a Nazarite involved these three things, (1) abstinence from wine and strong drink, (2) refraining from cutting the hair off the head during the whole period of the continuance of the vow, and (3) the avoidance of contact with the dead.</description>
    <description>When the period of the continuance of the vow came to an end, the Nazarite had to present himself at the door of the sanctuary with (1) a he lamb of the first year for a burnt-offering, (2) a ewe lamb of the first year for a sin-offering, and (3) a ram for a peace-offering. After these sacrifices were offered by the priest, the Nazarite cut off his hair at the door and threw it into the fire under the peace-offering.</description>
    <description>For some reason, probably in the midst of his work at Corinth, Paul took on himself the Nazarite vow. This could only be terminated by his going up to Jerusalem to offer up the hair which till then was to be left uncut. But it seems to have been allowable for persons at a distance to cut the hair, which was to be brought up to Jerusalem, where the ceremony was completed. This Paul did at Cenchrea just before setting out on his voyage into Syria (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 18:18</reflink>).</description>
    <description>On another occasion (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 21:23-26</reflink>), at the feast of Pentecost, Paul took on himself again the Nazarite vow. "The ceremonies involved took a longer time than Paul had at his disposal, but the law permitted a man to share the vow if he could find companions who had gone through the prescribed ceremonies, and who permitted him to join their company. This permission was commonly granted if the new comer paid all the fees required from the whole company (fee to the Levite for cutting the hair and fees for sacrifices), and finished the vow along with the others. Four Jewish Christians were performing the vow, and would admit Paul to their company, provided he paid their expenses. Paul consented, paid the charges, and when the last seven days of the vow began he went with them to live in the temple, giving the usual notice to the priests that he had joined in regular fashion, was a sharer with the four men, and that his vow would end with theirs. Nazarites retired to the temple during the last period of seven days, because they could be secure there against any accidental defilement" (Lindsay's Acts).</description>
    <description>As to the duration of a Nazarite's vow, every one was left at liberty to fix his own time. There is mention made in Scripture of only three who were Nazarites for life, Samson, Samuel, and John the Baptist (<reflink target="XXX">Judg. 13:4, 5; 1 Sam. 1:11; Luke 1:15</reflink>). In its ordinary form, however, the Nazarite's vow lasted only thirty, and at most one hundred, days. (<see target="x-self">See RECHABITES.</see>)</description>
    <description>This institution was a symbol of a life devoted to God and separated from all sin, a holy life.</description>

  <item id="Nebuchadnezzar">
    <description>in the Babylonian orthography Nabu-kudur-uzur, which means "Nebo, protect the crown!" or the "frontiers." In an inscription he styles himself "Nebo's favourite." He was the son and successor of Nabopolassar, who delivered Babylon from its dependence on Assyria and laid Nineveh in ruins. He was the greatest and most powerful of all the Babylonian kings. He married the daughter of Cyaxares, and thus the Median and Babylonian dynasties were united.</description>
    <description>Necho II., the king of Egypt, gained a victory over the Assyrians at Carchemish. (See JOSIAH; MEGIDDO</description>
    <description>Three years after this, Jehoiakim, who had reigned in Jerusalem as a Babylonian vassal, rebelled against the oppressor, trusting to help from Egypt (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 24:1</reflink>). This led Nebuchadnezzar to march an army again to the conquest of Jerusalem, which at once yielded to him (B.C. 598). A third time he came against it, and deposed Jehoiachin, whom he carried into Babylon, with a large portion of the population of the city, and the sacred vessels of the temple, placing Zedekiah on the throne of Judah in his stead. He also, heedless of the warnings of the prophet, entered into an alliance with Egypt, and rebelled against Babylon. This brought about the final siege of the city, which was at length taken and utterly destroyed (B.C. 586). Zedekiah was taken captive, and had his eyes put out by order of the king of Babylon, who made him a prisoner for the remainder of his life.</description>
    <description>An onyx cameo, now in the museum of Florence, bears on it an arrow-headed inscription, which is certainly ancient and genuine. The helmeted profile is said (Schrader) to be genuine also, but it is more probable that it is the portrait of a usurper in the time of Darius (Hystaspes), called Nidinta-Bel, who took the name of "Nebuchadrezzar." The inscription has been thus translated:, "In honour of Merodach, his lord, Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, in his lifetime had this made."</description>
    <description>A clay tablet, now in the British Museum, bears the following inscription, the only one as yet found which refers to his wars: "In the thirty-seventh year of Nebuchadnezzar, king of the country of Babylon, he went to Egypt [Misr] to make war. Amasis, king of Egypt, collected [his army], and marched and spread abroad." Thus were fulfilled the words of the prophet (<reflink target="XXX">Jer. 46:13-26; Ezek. 29:2-20</reflink>). Having completed the subjugation of Phoenicia, and inflicted chastisement on Egypt, Nebuchadnezzar now set himself to rebuild and adorn the city of Babylon (<reflink target="XXX">Dan. 4:30</reflink>), and to add to the greatness and prosperity of his kingdom by constructing canals and aqueducts and reservoirs surpassing in grandeur and magnificence everything of the kind mentioned in history (<reflink target="XXX">Dan. 2:37</reflink>). He is represented as a "king of kings," ruling over a vast kingdom of many provinces, with a long list of officers and rulers under him, "princes, governors, captains," etc. (3:2, 3, 27). He may, indeed, be said to have created the mighty empire over which he ruled.</description>
    <description>"Modern research has shown that Nebuchadnezzar was the greatest monarch that Babylon, or perhaps the East generally, ever produced. He must have possessed an enormous command of human labour, nine-tenths of Babylon itself, and nineteen-twentieths of all the other ruins that in almost countless profusion cover the land, are composed of bricks stamped with his name. He appears to have built or restored almost every city and temple in the whole country. His inscriptions give an elaborate account of the immense works which he constructed in and about Babylon itself, abundantly illustrating the boast, 'Is not this great Babylon which I have build?'" Rawlinson, Hist. Illustrations.</description>
    <description>After the incident of the "burning fiery furnace" (Dan. 3) into which the three Hebrew confessors were cast, Nebuchadnezzar was afflicted with some peculiar mental aberration as a punishment for his pride and vanity, probably the form of madness known as lycanthropy (i.e, "the change of a man into a wolf"). A remarkable confirmation of the Scripture narrative is afforded by the recent discovery of a bronze door-step, which bears an inscription to the effect that it was presented by Nebuchadnezzar to the great temple at Borsippa as a votive offering on account of his recovery from a terrible illness. (<see target="x-self">See DANIEL.</see>)</description>
    <description>He survived his recovery for some years, and died B.C. 562, in the eighty-third or eighty-fourth year of his age, after a reign of forty-three years, and was succeeded by his son Evil-merodach, who, after a reign of two years, was succeeded by Neriglissar (559-555), who was succeeded by Nabonadius (555-538), at the close of whose reign (less than a quarter of a century after the death of Nebuchadnezzar) Babylon fell under Cyrus at the head of the combined armies of Media and Persia.</description>
    <description>"I have examined," says Sir H. Rawlinson, "the bricks belonging perhaps to a hundred different towns and cities in the neighbourhood of Baghdad, and I never found any other legend than that of Nebuchadnezzar, son of Nabopolassar, king of Babylon." Nine-tenths of all the bricks amid the ruins of Babylon are stamped with his name.</description>

  <item id="Necho II">
    <description>an Egyptian king, the son and successor of Psammetichus (B.C. 610-594), the contemporary of Josiah, king of Judah. For some reason he proclaimed war against the king of Assyria. He led forth a powerful army and marched northward, but was met by the king of Judah at Megiddo, who refused him a passage through his territory. Here a fierce battle was fought and Josiah was slain (<reflink target="XXX">2 Chr. 35:20-24</reflink>). Possibly, as some suppose, Necho may have brought his army by sea to some port to the north of Dor (<reflink target="XXX">comp. Josh. 11:2; 12:23</reflink>), a Phoenician town at no great distance from Megiddo. After this battle Necho marched on to Carchemish (q.v.), where he met and conquered the Assyrian army, and thus all the Syrian provinces, including Palestine, came under his dominion.</description>
    <description>On his return march he deposed Jehoahaz, who had succeeded his father Josiah, and made Eliakim, Josiah's eldest son, whose name he changed into Jehoiakim, king. Jehoahaz he carried down into Egypt, where he died (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 23:31; 2 Chr. 36:1-4</reflink>). Four years after this conquest Necho again marched to the Euphrates; but here he was met and his army routed by the Chaldeans (B.C. 606) under Nebuchadnezzar, who drove the Egyptians back, and took from them all the territory they had conquered, from the Euphrates unto the "river of Egypt" (<reflink target="XXX">Jer. 46:2; 2 Kings 24:7, 8</reflink>).

  <item id="Nehemiah">
    <description>comforted by Jehovah. (1.) Ezra 2:2; Neh. 7:7. (2.) Neh. 3:16.</description>
    <description>(3.) The son of Hachaliah (<reflink target="XXX">Neh. 1:1</reflink>), and probably of the tribe of Judah. His family must have belonged to Jerusalem (<reflink target="XXX">Neh. 2:3</reflink>). He was one of the "Jews of the dispersion," and in his youth was appointed to the important office of royal cup-bearer at the palace of Shushan. The king, Artaxerxes Longimanus, seems to have been on terms of friendly familiarity with his attendant. Through his brother Hanani, and perhaps from other sources (<reflink target="XXX">Neh. 1:2; 2:3</reflink>), he heard of the mournful and desolate condition of the Holy City, and was filled with sadness of heart. For many days he fasted and mourned and prayed for the place of his fathers' sepulchres. At length the king observed his sadness of countenance and asked the reason of it. Nehemiah explained it all to the king, and obtained his permission to go up to Jerusalem and there to act as _tirshatha_, or governor of Judea. He went up in the spring of B.C. 446 (eleven years after Ezra), with a strong escort supplied by the king, and with letters to all the pashas of the provinces through which he had to pass, as also to Asaph, keeper of the royal forests, directing him to assist Nehemiah. On his arrival he set himself to survey the city, and to form a plan for its restoration; a plan which he carried out with great skill and energy, so that the whole was completed in about six months. He remained in Judea for thirteen years as governor, carrying out many reforms, notwithstanding much opposition that he encountered (<reflink target="XXX">Neh. 13:11</reflink>). He built up the state on the old lines, "supplementing and completing the work of Ezra," and making all arrangements for the safety and good government of the city. At the close of this important period of his public life, he returned to Persia to the service of his royal master at Shushan or Ecbatana. Very soon after this the old corrupt state of things returned, showing the worthlessness to a large extent of the professions that had been made at the feast of the dedication of the walls of the city (Neh. 12. See EZRA). Malachi now appeared among the people with words of stern reproof and solemn warning; and Nehemiah again returned from Persia (after an absence of some two years), and was grieved to see the widespread moral degeneracy that had taken place during his absence. He set himself with vigour to rectify the flagrant abuses that had sprung up, and restored the orderly administration of public worship and the outward observance of the law of Moses. Of his subsequent history we know nothing. Probably he remained at his post as governor till his death (about B.C. 413) in a good old age. The place of his death and burial is, however, unknown. "He resembled Ezra in his fiery zeal, in his active spirit of enterprise, and in the piety of his life: but he was of a bluffer and a fiercer mood; he had less patience with transgressors; he was a man of action rather than a man of thought, and more inclined to use force than persuasion. His practical sagacity and high courage were very markedly shown in the arrangement with which he carried through the rebuilding of the wall and balked the cunning plans of the 'adversaries.' The piety of his heart, his deeply religious spirit and constant sense of communion with and absolute dependence upon God, are strikingly exhibited, first in the long prayer recorded in ch. 1:5-11, and secondly and most remarkably in what have been called his 'interjectional prayers', those short but moving addresses to Almighty God which occur so frequently in his writings, the instinctive outpouring of a heart deeply moved, but ever resting itself upon God, and looking to God alone for aid in trouble, for the frustration of evil designs, and for final reward and acceptance" (Rawlinson). Nehemiah was the last of the governors sent from the Persian court. Judea after this was annexed to the satrapy of Coele-Syria, and was governed by the high priest under the jurisdiction of the governor of Syria, and the internal government of the country became more and more a hierarchy.</description>

  <item id="Nehemiah, Book of">
    <description>The author of this book was no doubt Nehemiah himself. There are portions of the book written in the first person (ch. 1-7; 12:27-47, and 13). But there are also portions of it in which Nehemiah is spoken of in the third person (ch. 8; 9; 10). It is supposed that these portions may have been written by Ezra; of this, however, there is no distinct evidence. These portions had their place assigned them in the book, there can be no doubt, by Nehemiah. He was the responsible author of the whole book, with the exception of ch. 12:11, 22, 23.</description>
    <description>The date at which the book was written was probably about B.C. 431-430, when Nehemiah had returned the second time to Jerusalem after his visit to Persia.</description>
    <description>The book, which may historically be regarded as a continuation of the book of Ezra, consists of four parts. (1.) An account of the rebuilding of the wall of Jerusalem, and of the register Nehemiah had found of those who had returned from Babylon (ch. 1-7). (2.) An account of the state of religion among the Jews during this time (8-10). (3.) Increase of the inhabitants of Jerusalem; the census of the adult male population, and names of the chiefs, together with lists of priests and Levites (11-12:1-26). (4.) Dedication of the wall of Jerusalem, the arrangement of the temple officers, and the reforms carried out by Nehemiah (12:27-ch. 13).</description>

  <item id="Nergal-sharezer">
    <description>Nergal, protect the king! (1.) One of the "princes of the king of Babylon who accompanied him in his last expedition against Jerusalem" (<reflink target="XXX">Jer. 39:3, 13</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(2.) Another of the "princes," who bore the title of "Rabmag." He was one of those who were sent to release Jeremiah from prison (<reflink target="XXX">Jer. 39:13</reflink>) by "the captain of the guard." He was a Babylonian grandee of high rank. From profane history and the inscriptions, we are led to conclude that he was the Neriglissar who murdered Evil-merodach, the son of Nebuchadnezzar, and succeeded him on the throne of Babylon (B.C. 559-556). He was married to a daughter of Nebuchadnezzar. The ruins of a palace, the only one on the right bank of the Euphrates, bear inscriptions denoting that it was built by this king. He was succeeded by his son, a mere boy, who was murdered after a reign of some nine months by a conspiracy of the nobles, one of whom, Nabonadius, ascended the vacant throne, and reigned for a period of seventeen years (B.C. 555-538), at the close of which period Babylon was taken by Cyrus. Belshazzar, who comes into notice in connection with the taking of Babylon, was by some supposed to have been the same as Nabonadius, who was called Nebuchadnezzar's son (<reflink target="XXX">Dan. 5:11, 18, 22</reflink>), because he had married his daughter. But it is known from the inscriptions that Nabonadius had a son called Belshazzar, who may have been his father's associate on the throne at the time of the fall of Babylon, and who therefore would be the grandson of Nebuchadnezzar. The Jews had only one word, usually rendered "father," to represent also such a relationship as that of "grandfather" or "great-grandfather."</description>

  <item id="Nero">
    <description>occurs only in the superscription (which is probably spurious, and is altogether omitted in the R.V.) to the Second Epistle to Timothy. He became emperor of Rome when he was about seventeen years of age (A.D. 54), and soon began to exhibit the character of a cruel tyrant and heathen debauchee. In May A.D. 64, a terrible conflagration broke out in Rome, which raged for six days and seven nights, and totally destroyed a great part of the city. The guilt of this fire was attached to him at the time, and the general verdict of history accuses him of the crime. "Hence, to suppress the rumour," says Tacitus (Annals, xv. 44), "he falsely charged with the guilt, and punished with the most exquisite tortures, the persons commonly called Christians, who are hated for their enormities. Christus, the founder of that name, was put to death as a criminal by Pontius Pilate, procurator of Judea, in the reign of Tiberius; but the pernicious superstition, repressed for a time, broke out again, not only throughout Judea, where the mischief originated, but through the city of Rome also, whither all things horrible and disgraceful flow, from all quarters, as to a common receptacle, and where they are encouraged. Accordingly, first three were seized, who confessed they were Christians. Next, on their information, a vast multitude were convicted, not so much on the charge of burning the city as of hating the human race. And in their deaths they were also made the subjects of sport; for they were covered with the hides of wild beasts and worried to death by dogs, or nailed to crosses, or set fire to, and, when day declined, burned to serve for nocturnal lights. Nero offered his own gardens for that spectacle, and exhibited a Circensian game, indiscriminately mingling with the common people in the habit of a charioteer, or else standing in his chariot; whence a feeling of compassion arose toward the sufferers, though guilty and deserving to be made examples of by capital punishment, because they seemed not to be cut off for the public good, but victims to the ferocity of one man." Another Roman historian, Suetonius (Nero, xvi.), says of him: "He likewise inflicted punishments on the Christians, a sort of people who hold a new and impious superstition" (Forbes's Footsteps of St. Paul, p. 60).</description>
    <description>Nero was the emperor before whom Paul was brought on his first imprisonment at Rome, and the apostle is supposed to have suffered martyrdom during this persecution. He is repeatedly alluded to in Scripture (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 25:11; Phil. 1:12, 13; 4:22</reflink>). He died A.D. 68.</description>

  <item id="Net">
    <description>in use among the Hebrews for fishing, hunting, and fowling. The fishing-net was probably constructed after the form of that used by the Egyptians (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 19:8</reflink>). There were three kinds of nets. (1.) The drag-net or hauling-net (Gr. sagene), of great size, and requiring many men to work it. It was usually let down from the fishing-boat, and then drawn to the shore or into the boat, as circumstances might require (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 13:47, 48</reflink>). (2.) The hand-net or casting-net (Gr. amphiblestron), which was thrown from a rock or a boat at any fish that might be seen (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 4:18; Mark 1:16</reflink>). It was called by the Latins funda. It was of circular form, "like the top of a tent." (3.) The bag-net (Gr. diktyon), used for enclosing fish in deep water (<reflink target="XXX">Luke 5:4-9</reflink>).</description>
    <description>The fowling-nets were (1) the trap, consisting of a net spread over a frame, and supported by a stick in such a way that it fell with the slightest touch (<reflink target="XXX">Amos 3:5, "gin;" Ps. 69:22; Job 18:9; Eccl. 9:12</reflink>). (2) The snare, consisting of a cord to catch birds by the leg (<reflink target="XXX">Job 18:10; Ps. 18:5; 116:3; 140:5</reflink>). (3.) The decoy, a cage filled with birds as decoys (<reflink target="XXX">Jer. 5:26, 27</reflink>). Hunting-nets were much in use among the Hebrews.</description>

  <item id="Nethinim">
    <description>the name given to the hereditary temple servants in all the post-Exilian books of Scripture. The word means given, i.e., "those set apart", viz., to the menial work of the sanctuary for the Levites. The name occurs seventeen times, and in each case in the Authorized Version incorrectly terminates in "s", "Nethinims;" in the Revised Version, correctly without the "s" (<reflink target="XXX">Ezra 2:70; 7:7, 24; 8:20, etc.</reflink>). The tradition is that the Gibeonites (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 9:27</reflink>) were the original caste, afterwards called Nethinim. Their numbers were added to afterwards from captives taken in battle; and they were formally given by David to the Levites (<reflink target="XXX">Ezra 8:20</reflink>), and so were called Nethinim, i.e., the given ones, given to the Levites to be their servants. Only 612 Nethinim returned from Babylon (<reflink target="XXX">Ezra 2:58; 8:20</reflink>). They were under the control of a chief from among themselves (2:43; Neh. 7:46). No reference to them appears in the New Testament, because it is probable that they became merged in the general body of the Jewish people.</description>

  </item>
  <item id="Nettle">
    <description>(1.) Heb. haral, "pricking" or "burning," Prov. 24:30, 31 (R.V. marg., "wild vetches"); Job 30:7; Zeph. 2:9. Many have supposed that some thorny or prickly plant is intended by this word, such as the bramble, the thistle, the wild plum, the cactus or prickly pear, etc. It may probably be a species of mustard, the Sinapis arvensis, which is a pernicious weed abounding in corn-fields. Tristram thinks that this word "designates the prickly acanthus (Acanthus spinosus), a very common and troublesome weed in the plains of Palestine."</description>
    <description>(2.) Heb. qimmosh, Isa. 34:13; Hos. 9:6; Prov. 24:31 (in both versions, "thorns"). This word has been regarded as denoting thorns, thistles, wild camomile; but probably it is correctly rendered "nettle," the Urtica pilulifera, "a tall and vigorous plant, often 6 feet high, the sting of which is much more severe and irritating than that of our common nettle."</description>

He is next met with in the Sanhedrin (7:50-52), where he protested against the course they were taking in plotting against Christ. Once more he is mentioned as taking part in the preparation for the anointing and burial of the body of Christ (<reflink target="XXX">John 19:39</reflink>). We hear nothing more of him.

They were seemingly a class of professing Christians, who sought to introduce into the church a false freedom or licentiousness, thus abusing Paul's doctrine of grace (comp. 2 Pet. 2:15, 16, 19), and were probably identical with those who held the doctrine of Baalam (q.v.), Rev. 2:14.</description>

The Hebrew word is derived from a root meaning "to scratch or tear the face," and may be best rendered, in accordance with the ancient versions, "an owl" (Strix flammea). The Revised Version renders "night-hawk."</description>

  <item id="Nile">
    <description>dark; blue, not found in Scripture, but frequently referred to in the Old Testament under the name of Sihor, i.e., "the black stream" (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 23:3; Jer. 2:18</reflink>) or simply "the river" (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 41:1; Ex. 1:22, etc.</reflink>) and the "flood of Egypt" (<reflink target="XXX">Amos 8:8</reflink>). It consists of two rivers, the White Nile, which takes its rise in the Victoria Nyanza, and the Blue Nile, which rises in the Abyssinian Mountains. These unite at the town of Khartoum, whence it pursues its course for 1,800 miles, and falls into the Mediterranean through its two branches, into which it is divided a few miles north of Cairo, the Rosetta and the Damietta branch.

  <item id="Nineveh">
    <description>First mentioned in Gen. 10:11, which is rendered in the Revised Version, "He [i.e., Nimrod] went forth into Assyria and builded Nineveh." It is not again noticed till the days of Jonah, when it is described (<reflink target="XXX">Jonah 3:3; 4:11</reflink>) as a great and populous city, the flourishing capital of the Assyrian empire (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 19:36; Isa. 37:37</reflink>). The book of the prophet Nahum is almost exclusively taken up with prophetic denunciations against this city. Its ruin and utter desolation are foretold (<reflink target="XXX">Nah.1:14; 3:19, etc.</reflink>). Zephaniah also (2:13-15) predicts its destruction along with the fall of the empire of which it was the capital. From this time there is no mention of it in Scripture till it is named in gospel history (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 12:41; Luke 11:32</reflink>).</description>
    <description>This "exceeding great city" lay on the eastern or left bank of the river Tigris, along which it stretched for some 30 miles, having an average breadth of 10 miles or more from the river back toward the eastern hills. This whole extensive space is now one immense area of ruins. Occupying a central position on the great highway between the Mediterranean and the Indian Ocean, thus uniting the East and the West, wealth flowed into it from many sources, so that it became the greatest of all ancient cities.</description>
    <description>About B.C. 633 the Assyrian empire began to show signs of weakness, and Nineveh was attacked by the Medes, who subsequently, about B.C. 625, being joined by the Babylonians and Susianians, again attacked it, when it fell, and was razed to the ground. The Assyrian empire then came to an end, the Medes and Babylonians dividing its provinces between them. "After having ruled for more than six hundred years with hideous tyranny and violence, from the Caucasus and the Caspian to the Persian Gulf, and from beyond the Tigris to Asia Minor and Egypt, it vanished like a dream" (<reflink target="XXX">Nah. 2:6-11</reflink>). Its end was strange, sudden, tragic. It was God's doing, his judgement on Assyria's pride (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 10:5-19</reflink>).</description>
    <description>Forty years ago our knowledge of the great Assyrian empire and of its magnificent capital was almost wholly a blank. Vague memories had indeed survived of its power and greatness, but very little was definitely known about it. Other cities which had perished, as Palmyra, Persepolis, and Thebes, had left ruins to mark their sites and tell of their former greatness; but of this city, imperial Nineveh, not a single vestige seemed to remain, and the very place on which it had stood was only matter of conjecture. In fulfilment of prophecy, God made "an utter end of the place." It became a "desolation."</description>
    <description>In the days of the Greek historian Herodotus, B.C. 400, it had become a thing of the past; and when Xenophon the historian passed the place in the "Retreat of the Ten Thousand," the very memory of its name had been lost. It was buried out of sight, and no one knew its grave. It is never again to rise from its ruins.</description>
    <description>At length, after being lost for more than two thousand years, the city was disentombed. A little more than forty years ago the French consul at Mosul began to search the vast mounds that lay along the opposite bank of the river. The Arabs whom he employed in these excavations, to their great surprise, came upon the ruins of a building at the mound of Khorsabad, which, on further exploration, turned out to be the royal palace of Sargon, one of the Assyrian kings. They found their way into its extensive courts and chambers, and brought forth form its hidded depths many wonderful sculptures and other relics of those ancient times.</description>
    <description>The work of exploration has been carried on almost continuously by M. Botta, Sir Henry Layard, George Smith, and others, in the mounds of Nebi-Yunus, Nimrud, Koyunjik, and Khorsabad, and a vast treasury of specimens of old Assyrian art has been exhumed. Palace after palace has been discovered, with their decorations and their sculptured slabs, revealing the life and manners of this ancient people, their arts of war and peace, the forms of their religion, the style of their architecture, and the magnificence of their monarchs. The streets of the city have been explored, the inscriptions on the bricks and tablets and sculptured figures have been read, and now the secrets of their history have been brought to light.</description>
    <description>One of the most remarkable of recent discoveries is that of the library of King Assur-bani-pal, or, as the Greek historians call him, Sardanapalos, the grandson of Sennacherib (q.v.). (<see target="x-self">See ASNAPPER.</see>) This library consists of about ten thousand flat bricks or tablets, all written over with Assyrian characters. They contain a record of the history, the laws, and the religion of Assyria, of the greatest value. These strange clay leaves found in the royal library form the most valuable of all the treasuries of the literature of the old world. The library contains also old Accadian documents, which are the oldest extant documents in the world, dating as far back as probably about the time of Abraham. (<see target="x-self">See SARGON.</see>)</description>
    <description>"The Assyrian royalty is, perhaps, the most luxurious of our century [reign of Assur-bani-pa]...Its victories and conquests, uninterrupted for one hundred years, have enriched it with the spoil of twenty peoples. Sargon has taken what remained to the Hittites; Sennacherib overcame Chaldea, and the treasures of Babylon were transferred to his coffers; Esarhaddon and Assur-bani-pal himself have pillaged Egypt and her great cities, Sais, Memphis, and Thebes of the hundred gates...Now foreign merchants flock into Nineveh, bringing with them the most valuable productions from all countries, gold and perfume from South Arabia and the Chaldean Sea, Egyptian linen and glass-work, carved enamels, goldsmiths' work, tin, silver, Phoenician purple; cedar wood from Lebanon, unassailable by worms; furs and iron from Asia Minor and Armenia" (Ancient Egypt and Assyria, by G. Maspero, page 271).</description>
    <description>The bas-reliefs, alabaster slabs, and sculptured monuments found in these recovered palaces serve in a remarkable manner to confirm the Old Testament history of the kings of Israel. The appearance of the ruins shows that the destruction of the city was due not only to the assailing foe but also to the flood and the fire, thus confirming the ancient prophecies concerning it. "The recent excavations," says Rawlinson, "have shown that fire was a great instrument in the destruction of the Nineveh palaces. Calcined alabaster, charred wood, and charcoal, colossal statues split through with heat, are met with in parts of the Nineveh mounds, and attest the veracity of prophecy."</description>
    <description>Nineveh in its glory was (<reflink target="XXX">Jonah 3:4</reflink>) an "exceeding great city of three days' journey", i.e., probably in circuit. This would give a circumference of about 60 miles. At the four corners of an irregular quadrangle are the ruins of Kouyunjik, Nimrud, Karamless and Khorsabad. These four great masses of ruins, with the whole area included within the parallelogram they form by lines drawn from the one to the other, are generally regarded as composing the whole ruins of Nineveh.</description>

"The multitude of No" (<reflink target="XXX">Jer. 46:25</reflink>) is more correctly rendered, as in the Revised Version, "Amon of No", i.e., No, where Jupiter Amon had his temple. In Ezek. 30:14, 16 it is simply called "No;" but in ver. 15 the name has the Hebrew Hamon prefixed to it, "Hamon No." This prefix is probably the name simply of the god usually styled Amon or Ammon. In Nah. 3:8 the "populous No" of the Authorized Version is in the Revised Version correctly rendered "No-Amon."</description>
    <description>It was the Diospolis or Thebes of the Greeks, celebrated for its hundred gates and its vast population. It stood on both sides of the Nile, and is by some supposed to have included Karnak and Luxor. In grandeur and extent it can only be compared to Nineveh. It is mentioned only in the prophecies referred to, which point to its total destruction. It was first taken by the Assyrians in the time of Sargon (Isa. 20). It was afterwards "delivered into the hand" of Nebuchadnezzar and Assurbani-pal (<reflink target="XXX">Jer. 46:25, 26</reflink>). Cambyses, king of the Persians (B.C. 525), further laid it waste by fire. Its ruin was completed (B.C. 81) by Ptolemy Lathyrus. The ruins of this city are still among the most notable in the valley of the Nile. They have formed a great storehouse of interesting historic remains for more than two thousand years. "As I wandered day after day with ever-growing amazement amongst these relics of ancient magnificence, I felt that if all the ruins in Europe, classical, Celtic, and medieval, were brought together into one centre, they would fall far short both in extent and grandeur of those of this single Egyptian city."

  <item id="Noah">
    <description>rest, (Heb. Noah) the grandson of Methuselah (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 5:25-29</reflink>), who was for two hundred and fifty years contemporary with Adam, and the son of Lamech, who was about fifty years old at the time of Adam's death. This patriarch is rightly regarded as the connecting link between the old and the new world. He is the second great progenitor of the human family.</description>
    <description>The words of his father Lamech at his birth (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 5:29</reflink>) have been regarded as in a sense prophetical, designating Noah as a type of Him who is the true "rest and comfort" of men under the burden of life (<reflink target="XXX">Matt.11:28</reflink>).</description>
    <description>He lived five hundred years, and then there were born unto him three sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 5:32</reflink>). He was a "just man and perfect in his generation," and "walked with God" (<reflink target="XXX">comp. Ezek. 14:14,20</reflink>). But now the descendants of Cain and of Seth began to intermarry, and then there sprang up a race distinguished for their ungodliness. Men became more and more corrupt, and God determined to sweep the earth of its wicked population (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 6:7</reflink>). But with Noah God entered into a covenant, with a promise of deliverance from the threatened deluge (18). He was accordingly commanded to build an ark (6:14-16) for the saving of himself and his house. An interval of one hundred and twenty years elapsed while the ark was being built (6:3), during which Noah bore constant testimony against the unbelief and wickedness of that generation (<reflink target="XXX">1 Pet. 3:18-20; 2 Pet. 2:5</reflink>).</description>
    <description>When the ark of "gopher-wood" (mentioned only here) was at length completed according to the command of the Lord, the living creatures that were to be preserved entered into it; and then Noah and his wife and sons and daughters-in-law entered it, and the "Lord shut him in" (<reflink target="XXX">Gen.7:16</reflink>). The judgment-threatened now fell on the guilty world, "the world that then was, being overflowed with water, perished" (<reflink target="XXX">2 Pet. 3:6</reflink>). The ark floated on the waters for one hundred and fifty days, and then rested on the mountains of Ararat (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 8:3,4</reflink>); but not for a considerable time after this was divine permission given him to leave the ark, so that he and his family were a whole year shut up within it (Gen. 6-14).</description>
    <description>On leaving the ark Noah's first act was to erect an altar, the first of which there is any mention, and offer the sacrifices of adoring thanks and praise to God, who entered into a covenant with him, the first covenant between God and man, granting him possession of the earth by a new and special charter, which remains in force to the present time (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 8:21-9:17</reflink>). As a sign and witness of this covenant, the rainbow was adopted and set apart by God, as a sure pledge that never again would the earth be destroyed by a flood.</description>
    <description>But, alas! Noah after this fell into grievous sin (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 9:21</reflink>); and the conduct of Ham on this sad occasion led to the memorable prediction regarding his three sons and their descendants. Noah "lived after the flood three hundred and fifty years, and he died" (28:29). (<see target="x-self">See DELUGE</see>).</description>

It has been identified by some with el-Isawiyeh, one mile and a half to the north-east of Jerusalem. But according to Isa. 10:28-32 it was on the south of Geba, on the road to Jerusalem, and within sight of the city. This identification does not meet these conditions, and hence others (as Dean Stanley) think that it was the northern summit of Mount Olivet, the place where David "worshipped God" when fleeing from Absalom (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 15:32</reflink>), or more probably (Conder) that it was the same as Mizpeh (q.v.), Judg. 20:1; Josh. 18:26; 1 Sam. 7:16, at Nebi Samwil, about 5 miles north-west of Jerusalem.</description>

In Hos. 9:6 the Hebrew name is Moph, and is translated "Memphis," which is its Greek and Latin form. It was one of the most ancient and important cities of Egypt, and stood a little to the south of the modern Cairo, on the western bank of the Nile. It was the capital of Lower Egypt.

  <item id="Numbering of the people">
    <description>Besides the numbering of the tribes mentioned in the history of the wanderings in the wilderness, we have an account of a general census of the whole nation from Dan to Beersheba, which David gave directions to Joab to make (<reflink target="XXX">1 Chr. 21:1</reflink>). Joab very reluctantly began to carry out the king's command.</description>
    <description>This act of David in ordering a numbering of the people arose from pride and a self-glorifying spirit. It indicated a reliance on his part on an arm of flesh, an estimating of his power not by the divine favour but by the material resources of his kingdom. He thought of military achievement and of conquest, and forgot that he was God's vicegerent. In all this he sinned against God. While Joab was engaged in the census, David's heart smote him, and he became deeply conscious of his fault; and in profound humiliation he confessed, "I have sinned greatly in what I have done." The prophet Gad was sent to him to put before him three dreadful alternatives (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 24:13; for "seven years" in this verse, the LXX. and 1 Chr. 21:12 have "three years"</reflink>), three of Jehovah's four sore judgments (<reflink target="XXX">Ezek. 14:21</reflink>). Two of these David had already experienced. He had fled for some months before Absalom, and had suffered three years' famine on account of the slaughter of the Gibeonites. In his "strait" David said, "Let me fall into the hands of the Lord." A pestilence broke out among the people, and in three days swept away 70,000. At David's intercession the plague was stayed, and at the threshing-floor of Araunah (q.v.), where the destroying angel was arrested in his progress, David erected an altar, and there offered up sacrifies to God (<reflink target="XXX">2 Chr. 3:1</reflink>).</description>
    <description>The census, so far as completed, showed that there were at least 1,300,000 fighting men in the kingdom, indicating at that time a population of about six or seven millions in all. (<see target="x-self">See CENSUS.</see>)</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Numbers, Book of">
    <description>the fourth of the books of the Pentateuch, called in the Hebrew be-midbar, i.e., "in the wilderness." In the LXX. version it is called "Numbers," and this name is now the usual title of the book. It is so called because it contains a record of the numbering of the people in the wilderness of Sinai (1-4), and of their numbering afterwards on the plain of Moab (26).</description>
    <description>This book is of special historical interest as furnishing us with details as to the route of the Israelites in the wilderness and their principal encampments. It may be divided into three parts:</description>
    <description>1. The numbering of the people at Sinai, and preparations for their resuming their march (1-10:10). The sixth chapter gives an account of the vow of a Nazarite.</description>
    <description>2. An account of the journey from Sinai to Moab, the sending out of the spies and the report they brought back, and the murmurings (eight times) of the people at the hardships by the way (10:11-21:20).</description>
    <description>3. The transactions in the plain of Moab before crossing the Jordan (21:21-ch. 36).</description>
    <description>The period comprehended in the history extends from the second month of the second year after the Exodus to the beginning of the eleventh month of the fortieth year, in all about thirty-eight years and ten months; a dreary period of wanderings, during which that disobedient generation all died in the wilderness. They were fewer in number at the end of their wanderings than when they left the land of Egypt. We see in this history, on the one hand, the unceasing care of the Almighty over his chosen people during their wanderings; and, on the other hand, the murmurings and rebellions by which they offended their heavenly Protector, drew down repeated marks of his displeasure, and provoked him to say that they should "not enter into his rest" because of their unbelief (<reflink target="XXX">Heb. 3:19</reflink>).</description>
    <description>This, like the other books of the Pentateuch, bears evidence of having been written by Moses.</description>
    <description>The expression "the book of the wars of the Lord," occurring in 21:14, has given rise to much discussion. But, after all, "what this book was is uncertain, whether some writing of Israel not now extant, or some writing of the Amorites which contained songs and triumphs of their king Sihon's victories, out of which Moses may cite this testimony, as Paul sometimes does out of heathen poets (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 17:28; Titus 1:12</reflink>)."</description>

  <item id="Oak">
    <description>There are six Hebrew words rendered "oak."</description>
    <description>(1.) 'El occurs only in the word El-paran (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 14:6</reflink>). The LXX. renders by "terebinth." In the plural form this word occurs in Isa. 1:29; 57:5 (A.V. marg. and R.V., "among the oaks"); 61:3 ("trees"). The word properly means strongly, mighty, and hence a strong tree.</description>
    <description>(2.) 'Elah, Gen. 35:4, "under the oak which was by Shechem" (R.V. marg., "terebinth"). Isa. 6:13, A.V., "teil-tree;" R.V., "terebinth." Isa. 1:30, R.V. marg., "terebinth." Absalom in his flight was caught in the branches of a "great oak" (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 18:9; R.V. marg., "terebinth"</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(3.) 'Elon, Judg. 4:11; 9:6 (R.V., "oak;" A.V., following the Targum, "plain") properly the deciduous species of oak shedding its foliage in autumn.</description>
    <description>(4.) 'Elan, only in Dan. 4:11,14,20, rendered "tree" in Nebuchadnezzar's dream. Probably some species of the oak is intended.</description>
    <description>(5.) 'Allah, Josh. 24:26. The place here referred to is called Allon-moreh ("the oak of Moreh," as in R.V.) in Gen. 12:6 and 35:4.</description>
    <description>(6.) 'Allon, always rendered "oak." Probably the evergreen oak (called also ilex and holm oak) is intended. The oak woods of Bashan are frequently alluded to (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 2:13; Ezek. 27:6</reflink>). Three species of oaks are found in Palestine, of which the "prickly evergreen oak" (Quercus coccifera) is the most abundant. "It covers the rocky hills of Palestine with a dense brushwood of trees from 8 to 12 feet high, branching from the base, thickly covered with small evergreen rigid leaves, and bearing acorns copiously." The so-called Abraham's oak at Hebron is of this species. Tristram says that this oak near Hebron "has for several centuries taken the place of the once renowned terebinth which marked the site of Mamre on the other side of the city. The terebinth existed at Mamre in the time of Vespasian, and under it the captive Jews were sold as slaves. It disappeared about A.D. 330, and no tree now marks the grove of Mamre. The present oak is the noblest tree in Southern Palestine, being 23 feet in girth, and the diameter of the foliage, which is unsymmetrical, being about 90 feet."

God is represented as taking an oath (<reflink target="XXX">Heb. 6:16-18</reflink>), so also Christ (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 26:64</reflink>), and Paul (<reflink target="XXX">Rom. 9:1; Gal. 1:20; Phil. 1:8</reflink>). The precept, "Swear not at all," refers probably to ordinary conversation between man and man (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 5:34,37</reflink>). But if the words are taken as referring to oaths, then their intention may have been to show "that the proper state of Christians is to require no oaths; that when evil is expelled from among them every yea and nay will be as decisive as an oath, every promise as binding as a vow."</description>

Ahab seems to have held Obadiah in great honour, although he had no sympathy with his piety (5, 6, 7). The last notice of him is his bringing back tidings to Ahab that Elijah, whom he had so long sought for, was at hand (9-16). "Go," said Elijah to him, when he met him in the way, "go tell thy lord, Behold, Elijah is here."</description>

  <item id="Obadiah, Book of">
    <description>consists of one chapter, "concerning Edom," its impending doom (1:1-16), and the restoration of Israel (1:17-21). This is the shortest book of the Old Testament.</description>
    <description>There are on record the account of four captures of Jerusalem, (1) by Shishak in the reign of Rehoboam (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 14:25</reflink>); (2) by the Philistines and Arabians in the reign of Jehoram (<reflink target="XXX">2 Chr. 21:16</reflink>); (3) by Joash, the king of Israel, in the reign of Amaziah (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 14:13</reflink>); and (4) by the Babylonians, when Jerusalem was taken and destroyed by Nebuchadnezzar (B.C. 586). Obadiah (1:11-14) speaks of this capture as a thing past. He sees the calamity as having already come on Jerusalem, and the Edomites as joining their forces with those of the Chaldeans in bringing about the degradation and ruin of Israel. We do not indeed read that the Edomites actually took part with the Chaldeans, but the probabilities are that they did so, and this explains the words of Obadiah in denouncing against Edom the judgments of God. The date of his prophecies was thus in or about the year of the destruction of Jerusalem.</description>

When David was bringing up the ark "from the house of Abinadab, that was in Gibeah" (probably some hill or eminence near Kirjath-jearim), and had reached Nachon's threshing-floor, he became afraid because of the "breach upon Uzzah," and carried it aside into the house of Obededom (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 6:1-12</reflink>).

  <item id="Oil">
    <description>Only olive oil seems to have been used among the Hebrews. It was used for many purposes: for anointing the body or the hair (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 29:7; 2 Sam. 14:2; Ps. 23:5; 92:10; 104:15; Luke 7:46</reflink>); in some of the offerings (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 29:40; Lev. 7:12; Num. 6:15; 15:4</reflink>), but was excluded from the sin-offering (<reflink target="XXX">Lev. 5:11</reflink>) and the jealousy-offering (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 5:15</reflink>); for burning in lamps (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 25:6; 27:20; Matt. 25:3</reflink>); for medicinal purposes (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 1:6; Luke 10:34; James 5:14</reflink>); and for anointing the dead (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 26:12; Luke 23:56</reflink>).</description>
    <description>It was one of the most valuable products of the country (<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 32:13; Ezek. 16:13</reflink>), and formed an article of extensive commerce with Tyre (27:17).</description>
    <description>The use of it was a sign of gladness (<reflink target="XXX">Ps. 92:10; Isa. 61:3</reflink>), and its omission a token of sorrow (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 14:2; Matt. 6:17</reflink>). It was very abundant in Galilee. (<see target="x-self">See OLIVE.</see>)</description>

It was probably the oleaster (Eleagnus angustifolius), which grows abundantly in almost all parts of Palestine, especially about Hebron and Samaria. "It has a fine hard wood," says Tristram, "and yields an inferior oil, but it has no relationship to the olive, which, however, it resembles in general appearance."</description>

  <item id="Olive">
    <description>the fruit of the olive-tree. This tree yielded oil which was highly valued. The best oil was from olives that were plucked before being fully ripe, and then beaten or squeezed (<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 24:20; Isa. 17:6; 24:13</reflink>). It was called "beaten," or "fresh oil" (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 27:20</reflink>). There were also oil-presses, in which the oil was trodden out by the feet (<reflink target="XXX">Micah 6:15</reflink>). James (3:12) calls the fruit "olive berries." The phrase "vineyards and olives" (<reflink target="XXX">Judg. 15:5, A.V.</reflink>) should be simply "olive-yard," or "olive-garden," as in the Revised Version. (<see target="x-self">See OIL.</see>)</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Olive-tree">
    <description>is frequently mentioned in Scripture. The dove from the ark brought an olive-branch to Noah (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 8:11</reflink>). It is mentioned among the most notable trees of Palestine, where it was cultivated long before the time of the Hebrews (<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 6:11; 8:8</reflink>). It is mentioned in the first Old Testament parable, that of Jotham (<reflink target="XXX">Judg. 9:9</reflink>), and is named among the blessings of the "good land," and is at the present day the one characteristic tree of Palestine. The oldest olive-trees in the country are those which are enclosed in the Garden of Gethsemane. It is referred to as an emblem of prosperity and beauty and religious privilege (<reflink target="XXX">Ps. 52:8; Jer. 11:16; Hos. 14:6</reflink>). The two "witnesses" mentioned in Rev. 11:4 are spoken of as "two olive trees standing before the God of the earth." (<reflink target="XXX">Comp. Zech. 4:3, 11-14.</reflink>)</description>
    <description>The "olive-tree, wild by nature" (<reflink target="XXX">Rom. 11:24</reflink>), is the shoot or cutting of the good olive-tree which, left ungrafted, grows up to be a "wild olive." In Rom. 11:17 Paul refers to the practice of grafting shoots of the wild olive into a "good" olive which has become unfruitful. By such a process the sap of the good olive, by pervading the branch which is "graffed in," makes it a good branch, bearing good olives. Thus the Gentiles, being a "wild olive," but now "graffed in," yield fruit, but only through the sap of the tree into which they have been graffed. This is a process "contrary to nature" (11:24).</description>

  <item id="Olves, Mount of">
    <description>so called from the olive trees with which its sides are clothed, is a mountain ridge on the east of Jerusalem (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 11:7; Ezek. 11:23; Zech. 14:4</reflink>), from which it is separated by the valley of Kidron. It is first mentioned in connection with David's flight from Jerusalem through the rebellion of Absalom (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 15:30</reflink>), and is only once again mentioned in the Old Testament, in Zech. 14:4. It is, however, frequently alluded to (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 11:7; 2 Kings 23:13; Neh. 8:15; Ezek. 11:23</reflink>).</description>
    <description>It is frequently mentioned in the New Testament (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 21:1; 26:30, etc.</reflink>). It now bears the name of Jebel et-Tur, i.e., "Mount of the Summit;" also sometimes called Jebel ez-Zeitun, i.e., "Mount of Olives." It is about 200 feet above the level of the city. The road from Jerusalem to Bethany runs as of old over this mount. It was on this mount that Jesus stood when he wept over Jerusalem. "No name in Scripture," says Dr. Porter, "calls up associations at once so sacred and so pleasing as that of Olivet. The 'mount' is so intimately connected with the private, the devotional life of the Saviour, that we read of it and look at it with feelings of deepest interest and affection. Here he often sat with his disciples, telling them of wondrous events yet to come, of the destruction of the Holy City; of the sufferings, the persecution, and the final triumph of his followers (Matt. 24). Here he gave them the beautiful parables of the ten virgins and the five talents (25); here he was wont to retire on each evening for meditation, and prayer, and rest of body, when weary and harassed by the labours and trials of the day (<reflink target="XXX">Luke 21:37</reflink>); and here he came on the night of his betrayal to utter that wonderful prayer, 'O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me: nevertheless not as I will, but as thou wilt' (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 26:39</reflink>). And when the cup of God's wrath had been drunk, and death and the grave conquered, he led his disciples out again over Olivet as far as to Bethany, and after a parting blessing ascended to heaven (<reflink target="XXX">Luke 24:50, 51; Acts 1:12</reflink>)."</description>
    <description>This mount, or rather mountain range, has four summits or peaks: (1) the "Galilee" peak, so called from a tradition that the angels stood here when they spoke to the disciples (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 1:11</reflink>); (2) the "Mount of Ascension," the supposed site of that event, which was, however, somewhere probably nearer Bethany (<reflink target="XXX">Luke 24:51, 52</reflink>); (3) the "Prophets," from the catacombs on its side, called "the prophets' tombs;" and (4) the "Mount of Corruption," so called because of the "high places" erected there by Solomon for the idolatrous worship of his foreign wives (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 11:7; 2 Kings 23:13; Vulg., "Mount of Offence"</reflink>).</description>

  <item id="Omri">
    <description>servant of Jehovah. When Elah was murdered by Zimri at Tirzah (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 16:15-27</reflink>), Omri, his captain, was made king (B.C. 931). For four years there was continued opposition to his reign, Tibni, another claimant to the throne, leading the opposing party; but at the close of that period all his rivals were defeated, and he became king of Israel, "Tibni died and Omri reigned" (B.C. 927). By his vigour and power he gained great eminence and consolidated the kingdom. He fixed his dynasty on the throne so firmly that it continued during four succeeding reigns. Tirza was for six years the seat of his government. He then removed the capital to Samaria (q.v.), where he died, and was succeeded by his son Ahab. "He wrought evil in the eyes of the Lord, and did worse than all that were before him."</description>
    <description>Beth-omri, "the house" or "city of Omri," is the name usually found on Assyrian inscriptions for Samaria. In the stele of Mesha (the "Moabite stone"), which was erected in Moab about twenty or thirty years after Omri's death, it is recorded that Omri oppressed Moab till Mesha delivered the land: "Omri, king of Israel, oppressed Moab many days, for Chemosh was angry with his land. His son succeeded him, and he also said, I will oppress Moab" (comp. 2 Kings 1:1; 3:4, 5). The "Moabite stone" also records that "Omri took the land of Medeba, and occupied it in his day and in the days of his son forty years."</description>

  <item id="On">
    <description>light; the sun, (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 41:45, 50</reflink>), the great seat of sun-worship, called also Bethshemesh (<reflink target="XXX">Jer. 43:13</reflink>) and Aven (<reflink target="XXX">Ezek. 30:17</reflink>), stood on the east bank of the Nile, a few miles north of Memphis, and near Cairo, in the north-east. The Vulgate and the LXX. Versions have "Heliopolis" ("city of the sun") instead of On in Genesis and of Aven in Ezekiel. The "city of destruction" Isaiah speaks of (19:18, marg. "of Heres;" Heb. 'Ir-ha-heres, which some MSS. read Ir-ha-heres, i.e., "city of the sun") may be the name given to On, the prophecy being that the time will come when that city which was known as the "city of the sun-god" shall become the "city of destruction" of the sun-god, i.e., when idolatry shall cease, and the worship of the true God be established.</description>
    <description>In ancient times this city was full of obelisks dedicated to the sun. Of these only one now remains standing. "Cleopatra's Needle" was one of those which stood in this city in front of the Temple of Tum, i.e., "the sun." It is now erected on the Thames Embankment, London.</description>
    <description>"It was at On that Joseph wooed and won the dark-skinned Asenath, the daughter of the high priest of its great temple." This was a noted university town, and here Moses gained his acquaintance with "all the wisdom of the Egyptians."</description>

    <description>useful, a slave who, after robbing his master Philemon (q.v.) at Colosse, fled to Rome, where he was converted by the apostle Paul, who sent him back to his master with the epistle which bears his name. In it he beseeches Philemon to receive his slave as a "faithful and beloved brother." Paul offers to pay to Philemon anything his slave had taken, and to bear the wrong he had done him. He was accompanied on his return by Tychicus, the bearer of the Epistle to the Colossians (<reflink target="XXX">Philemon 1:16, 18</reflink>).</description>
    <description>The story of this fugitive Colossian slave is a remarkable evidence of the freedom of access to the prisoner which was granted to all, and "a beautiful illustration both of the character of St. Paul and the transfiguring power and righteous principles of the gospel."</description>

Not succeeding in their attempts to deter Nehemiah from rebuilding the walls of Jerusalem, Sanballat and Tobiah resorted to strategem, and pretending to wish a conference with him, they invited him to meet them at Ono. Four times they made the request, and every time Nehemiah refused to come. Their object was to take him prisoner.</description>

  <item id="Onycha">
    <description>a nail; claw; hoof, (Heb. sheheleth; Ex. 30:34), a Latin word applied to the operculum, i.e., the claw or nail of the strombus or wing-shell, a univalve common in the Red Sea. The opercula of these shell-fish when burned emit a strong odour "like castoreum." This was an ingredient in the sacred incense.</description>

It was found in the land of Havilah (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 2:12</reflink>). The LXX. translates the Hebrew word by smaragdos, an emerald. Some think that the sardonyx is meant. But the onyx differs from the sardonyx in this, that while the latter has two layers (black and white) the former has three (black, white, and red).</description>

It was surrounded by a separate wall, and was occupied by the Nethinim after the Captivity. This wall has been discovered by the engineers of the Palestine Exploration Fund at the south-eastern angle of the temple area. It is 4 feet below the present surface. In 2 Kings 5:24 this word is translated "tower" (R.V., "hill"), denoting probably some eminence near Elisha's house.</description>

In the LXX. this word is rendered "Sophir," and "Sofir" is the Coptic name for India, which is the rendering of the Arabic version, as also of the Vulgate. Josephus has identified it with the Golden Chersonese, i.e., the Malay peninsula. It is now generally identified with Abhira, at the mouth of the Indus. Much may be said, however, in favour of the opinion that it was somewhere in Arabia.</description>

After his great victory over the Midianites, he slew at this place the captive kings (8:18-21). He then assumed the function of high priest, and sought to make Ophrah what Shiloh should have been. This thing "became a snare" to Gideon and his house. After Gideon's death his family resided here till they were put to death by Abimelech (<reflink target="XXX">Judg. 9:5</reflink>).

  <item id="Oracle">

In 2 Sam. 16:23 it means the Word of God. A man inquired "at the oracle of God" by means of the Urim and Thummim in the breastplate on the high priest's ephod. In the New Testament it is used only in the plural, and always denotes the Word of God (<reflink target="XXX">Rom. 3:2; Heb. 5:12, etc.</reflink>). The Scriptures are called "living oracles" (<reflink target="XXX">comp. Heb. 4:12</reflink>) because of their quickening power (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 7:38</reflink>).</description>

The Vulgate renders thus, but the LXX. renders by Hesperus, i.e., "the evening-star," Venus. The Orientals "appear to have conceived of this constellation under the figure of an impious giant bound upon the sky." This giant was, according to tradition, Nimrod, the type of the folly that contends against God. In Isa. 13:10 the plural form of the Hebrew word is rendered "constellations."</description>

  <item id="Ossifrage">
    <description>Heb. peres = to "break" or "crush", the lammer-geier, or bearded vulture, the largest of the whole vulture tribe. It was an unclean bird (<reflink target="XXX">Lev. 11:13; Deut. 14:12</reflink>). It is not a gregarious bird, and is found but rarely in Palestine. "When the other vultures have picked the flesh off any animal, he comes in at the end of the feast, and swallows the bones, or breaks them, and swallows the pieces if he cannot otherwise extract the marrow. The bones he cracks [hence the appropriateness of the name ossifrage, i.e., "bone-breaker"] by letting them fall on a rock from a great height. He does not, however, confine himself to these delicacies, but whenever he has an opportunity will devour lambs, kids, or hares. These he generally obtains by pushing them over cliffs, when he has watched his opportunity; and he has been known to attack men while climbing rocks, and dash them against the bottom. But tortoises and serpents are his ordinary food...No doubt it was a lammer-geier that mistook the bald head of the poet AEschylus for a stone, and dropped on it the tortoise which killed him" (Tristram's Nat. Hist.).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Ostrich">
    <description>(<reflink target="XXX">Lam. 4:3</reflink>), the rendering of Hebrew pl. enim; so called from its greediness and gluttony. The allusion here is to the habit of the ostrich with reference to its eggs, which is thus described: "The outer layer of eggs is generally so ill covered that they are destroyed in quantities by jackals, wild-cats, etc., and that the natives carry them away, only taking care not to leave the marks of their footsteps, since, when the ostrich comes and finds that her nest is discovered, she crushes the whole brood, and builds a nest elsewhere." In Job 39:13 this word in the Authorized Version is the rendering of a Hebrew word (notsah) which means "feathers," as in the Revised Version. In the same verse the word "peacocks" of the Authorized Version is the rendering of the Hebrew pl. renanim, properly meaning "ostriches," as in the Revised Version.

Some thirty years after the death of Joshua, the Israelites fell under the subjection of Chushan-rishathaim (q.v.), the king of Mesopotamia. He oppressed them for full eight years, when they "cried" unto Jehovah, and Othniel was raised up to be their deliverer. He was the younger brother of Caleb (<reflink target="XXX">Judg. 3:8, 9-11</reflink>). He is the only judge mentioned connected with the tribe of Judah.

    <description>Heb. tannur, (<reflink target="XXX">Hos. 7:4</reflink>). In towns there appear to have been public ovens. There was a street in Jerusalem (<reflink target="XXX">Jer. 37:21</reflink>) called "bakers' street" (the only case in which the name of a street in Jerusalem is preserved). The words "tower of the furnaces" (<reflink target="XXX">Neh. 3:11; 12:38</reflink>) is more properly "tower of the ovens" (Heb. tannurim). These resemble the ovens in use among ourselves.</description>
    <description>There were other private ovens of different kinds. Some were like large jars made of earthenware or copper, which were heated inside with wood (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 17:12; Isa. 44:15; Jer. 7:18</reflink>) or grass (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 6:30</reflink>), and when the fire had burned out, small pieces of dough were placed inside or spread in thin layers on the outside, and were thus baked.

In the list of unclean birds (<reflink target="XXX">Lev. 11:16; Deut. 14:15</reflink>); also mentioned in Job 30:29; Isa. 13:21; 34:13; 43:20; Jer. 50:39; Micah 1:8. In all these passages the Revised Version translates "ostrich" (q.v.), which is the correct rendering.</description>
    <description>(2.) Heb. yanshuph, rendered "great owl" in Lev. 11:17; Deut. 14:16, and "owl" in Isa. 34:11. This is supposed to be the Egyptian eagle-owl (Bubo ascalaphus), which takes the place of the eagle-owl (Bubo maximus) found in Southern Europe. It is found frequenting the ruins of Egypt and also of the Holy Land. "Its cry is a loud, prolonged, and very powerful hoot. I know nothing which more vividly brought to my mind the sense of desolation and loneliness than the re-echoing hoot of two or three of these great owls as I stood at midnight among the ruined temples of Baalbek" (Tristram).</description>
    <description>The LXX. and Vulgate render this word by "ibis", i.e., the Egyptian heron.</description>
    <description>(3.) Heb. kos, rendered "little owl" in Lev. 11:17; Deut. 14:16, and "owl" in Ps. 102:6. The Arabs call this bird "the mother of ruins." It is by far the most common of all the owls of Palestine. It is the Athene persica, the bird of Minerva, the symbol of ancient Athens.</description>
    <description>(4.) Heb. kippoz, the "great owl" (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 34:15</reflink>); Revised Version, "arrow-snake;" LXX. and Vulgate, "hedgehog," reading in the text, kippod, instead of kippoz. There is no reason to doubt the correctness of the rendering of the Authorized Version. Tristram says: "The word [i.e., kippoz] is very possibly an imitation of the cry of the scops owl (Scops giu), which is very common among ruins, caves, and old walls of towns...It is a migrant, returning to Palestine in spring."</description>
    <description>(5.) Heb. lilith, "screech owl" (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 34:14, marg. and R.V., "night monster"</reflink>). The Hebrew word is from a root signifying "night." Some species of the owl is obviously intended by this word. It may be the hooting or tawny owl (Syrnium aluco), which is common in Egypt and in many parts of Palestine. This verse in Isaiah is "descriptive of utter and perpetual desolation, of a land that should be full of ruins, and inhabited by the animals that usually make such ruins their abode."</description>

  <item id="Ox">
    <description>Heb. bakar, "cattle;" "neat cattle", (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 12:16; 34:28; Job 1:3, 14; 42:12, etc.</reflink>); not to be muzzled when treading the corn (<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 25:4</reflink>). Referred to by our Lord in his reproof to the Pharisees (<reflink target="XXX">Luke 13:15; 14:5</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Ox goad">
    <description>mentioned only in Judg. 3:31, the weapon with which Shamgar (q.v.) slew six hundred Philistines. "The ploughman still carries his goad, a weapon apparently more fitted for the hand of the soldier than the peaceful husbandman. The one I saw was of the 'oak of Bashan,' and measured upwards of ten feet in length. At one end was an iron spear, and at the other a piece of the same metal flattened. One can well understand how a warrior might use such a weapon with effect in the battle-field" (Porter's Syria, etc.). (<see target="x-self">See GOAD.</see>)</description>

  </item>
  <item id="Paint">
    <description>Jezebel "painted her face" (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 9:30</reflink>); and the practice of painting the face and the eyes seems to have been common (<reflink target="XXX">Jer. 4:30; Ezek. 23:40</reflink>). An allusion to this practice is found in the name of Job's daughter (42:14) Kerenhappuch (q.v.). Paintings in the modern sense of the word were unknown to the ancient Jews.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Palace">
    <description>Used now only of royal dwellings, although originally meaning simply (as the Latin word palatium, from which it is derived, shows) a building surrounded by a fence or a paling. In the Authorized Version there are many different words so rendered, presenting different ideas, such as that of citadel or lofty fortress or royal residence (<reflink target="XXX">Neh. 1:1; Dan. 8:2</reflink>). It is the name given to the temple fortress (<reflink target="XXX">Neh. 2:8</reflink>) and to the temple itself (<reflink target="XXX">1 Chr. 29:1</reflink>). It denotes also a spacious building or a great house (<reflink target="XXX">Dan. 1:4; 4:4, 29: Esther 1:5; 7:7</reflink>), and a fortified place or an enclosure (<reflink target="XXX">Ezek. 25:4</reflink>). Solomon's palace is described in 1 Kings 7:1-12 as a series of buildings rather than a single great structure. Thirteen years were spent in their erection. This palace stood on the eastern hill, adjoining the temple on the south.</description>
    <description>In the New Testament it designates the official residence of Pilate or that of the high priest (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 26:3, 58, 69; Mark 14:54, 66; John 18:15</reflink>). In Phil. 1:13 this word is the rendering of the Greek praitorion, meaning the praetorian cohorts at Rome (the life-guard of the Caesars). Paul was continually chained to a soldier of that corps (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 28:16</reflink>), and hence his name and sufferings became known in all the praetorium. The "soldiers that kept" him would, on relieving one another on guard, naturally spread the tidings regarding him among their comrades. Some, however, regard the praetroium (q.v.) as the barrack within the palace (the palatium) of the Caesars in Rome where a detachment of these praetorian guards was stationed, or as the camp of the guards placed outside the eastern walls of Rome.</description>
    <description>"In the chambers which were occupied as guard-rooms," says Dr. Manning, "by the praetorian troops on duty in the palace, a number of rude caricatures are found roughly scratched upon the walls, just such as may be seen upon barrack walls in every part of the world. Amongst these is one of a human figure nailed upon a cross. To add to the 'offence of the cross,' the crucified one is represented with the head of an animal, probably that of an ass. Before it stands the figure of a Roman legionary with one hand upraised in the attitude of worship. Underneath is the rude, misspelt, ungrammatical inscription, Alexamenos worships his god. It can scarcely be doubted that we have here a contemporary caricature, executed by one of the praetorian guard, ridiculing the faith of a Christian comrade."</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Palestine">
    <description>originally denoted only the sea-coast of the land of Canaan inhabited by the Philistines (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 15:14; Isa. 14:29, 31; Joel 3:4</reflink>), and in this sense exclusively the Hebrew name Pelesheth (rendered "Philistia" in Ps. 60:8; 83:7; 87:4; 108:9) occurs in the Old Testament.</description>
    <description>Not till a late period in Jewish history was this name used to denote "the land of the Hebrews" in general (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 40:15</reflink>). It is also called "the holy land" (<reflink target="XXX">Zech. 2:12</reflink>), the "land of Jehovah" (<reflink target="XXX">Hos. 9:3; Ps. 85:1</reflink>), the "land of promise" (<reflink target="XXX">Heb. 11:9</reflink>), because promised to Abraham (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 12:7; 24:7</reflink>), the "land of Canaan" (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 12:5</reflink>), the "land of Israel" (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 13:19</reflink>), and the "land of Judah" (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 19:17</reflink>).</description>
    <description>The territory promised as an inheritance to the seed of Abraham (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 15:18-21; Num. 34:1-12</reflink>) was bounded on the east by the river Euphrates, on the west by the Mediterranean, on the north by the "entrance of Hamath," and on the south by the "river of Egypt." This extent of territory, about 60,000 square miles, was at length conquered by David, and was ruled over also by his son Solomon (2 Sam. 8; 1 Chr. 18; 1 Kings 4:1, 21). This vast empire was the Promised Land; but Palestine was only a part of it, terminating in the north at the southern extremity of the Lebanon range, and in the south in the wilderness of Paran, thus extending in all to about 144 miles in length. Its average breadth was about 60 miles from the Mediterranean on the west to beyond the Jordan. It has fittingly been designated "the least of all lands." Western Palestine, on the south of Gaza, is only about 40 miles in breadth from the Mediterranean to the Dead Sea, narrowing gradually toward the north, where it is only 20 miles from the sea-coast to the Jordan.</description>
    <description>Palestine, "set in the midst" (<reflink target="XXX">Ezek. 5:5</reflink>) of all other lands, is the most remarkable country on the face of the earth. No single country of such an extent has so great a variety of climate, and hence also of plant and animal life. Moses describes it as "a good land, a land of brooks of water, of fountains and depths that spring out of valleys and hills; a land of wheat, and barley, and vines, and fig trees, and pomegranates; a land of oil olive, and honey; a land wherein thou shalt not eat bread without scarceness, thou shalt not lack any thing in it; a land whose stones are iron, and out of whose hills thou mayest dig brass" (<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 8:7-9</reflink>).</description>
    <description>"In the time of Christ the country looked, in all probability, much as now. The whole land consists of rounded limestone hills, fretted into countless stony valleys, offering but rarely level tracts, of which Esdraelon alone, below Nazareth, is large enough to be seen on the map. The original woods had for ages disappeared, though the slopes were dotted, as now, with figs, olives, and other fruit-trees where there was any soil. Permanent streams were even then unknown, the passing rush of winter torrents being all that was seen among the hills. The autumn and spring rains, caught in deep cisterns hewn out like huge underground jars in the soft limestone, with artificial mud-banked ponds still found near all villages, furnished water. Hills now bare, or at best rough with stunted growth, were then terraced, so as to grow vines, olives, and grain. To-day almost desolate, the country then teemed with population. Wine-presses cut in the rocks, endless terraces, and the ruins of old vineyard towers are now found amidst solitudes overgrown for ages with thorns and thistles, or with wild shrubs and poor gnarled scrub" (Geikie's Life of Christ).</description>
    <description>From an early period the land was inhabited by the descendants of Canaan, who retained possession of the whole land "from Sidon to Gaza" till the time of the conquest by Joshua, when it was occupied by the twelve tribes. Two tribes and a half had their allotments given them by Moses on the east of the Jordan (<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 3:12-20; comp. Num. 1:17-46; Josh. 4:12-13</reflink>). The remaining tribes had their portion on the west of Jordan.</description>
    <description>From the conquest till the time of Saul, about four hundred years, the people were governed by judges. For a period of one hundred and twenty years the kingdom retained its unity while it was ruled by Saul and David and Solomon. On the death of Solomon, his son Rehoboam ascended the throne; but his conduct was such that ten of the tribes revolted, and formed an independent monarchy, called the kingdom of Israel, or the northern kingdom, the capital of which was first Shechem and afterwards Samaria. This kingdom was destroyed. The Israelites were carried captive by Shalmanezer, king of Assyria, B.C. 722, after an independent existence of two hundred and fifty-three years. The place of the captives carried away was supplied by tribes brought from the east, and thus was formed the Samaritan nation (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 17:24-29</reflink>).</description>
    <description>Nebuchadnezzar came up against the kingdom of the two tribes, the kingdom of Judah, the capital of which was Jerusalem, one hundred and thirty-four years after the overthrow of the kingdom of Israel. He overthrew the city, plundered the temple, and carried the people into captivity to Babylon (B.C. 587), where they remained seventy years. At the close of the period of the Captivity, they returned to their own land, under the edict of Cyrus (<reflink target="XXX">Ezra 1:1-4</reflink>). They rebuilt the city and temple, and restored the old Jewish commonwealth.</description>
    <description>For a while after the Restoration the Jews were ruled by Zerubbabel, Ezra, and Nehemiah, and afterwards by the high priests, assisted by the Sanhedrin. After the death of Alexander the Great at Babylon (B.C. 323), his vast empire was divided between his four generals. Egypt, Arabia, Palestine, and Coele-Syria fell to the lot of Ptolemy Lagus. Ptolemy took possession of Palestine in B.C. 320, and carried nearly one hundred thousand of the inhabitants of Jerusalem into Egypt. He made Alexandria the capital of his kingdom, and treated the Jews with consideration, confirming them in the enjoyment of many privileges.</description>
    <description>After suffering persecution at the hands of Ptolemy's successors, the Jews threw off the Egyptian yoke, and became subject to Antiochus the Great, the king of Syria. The cruelty and opression of the successors of Antiochus at length led to the revolt under the Maccabees (B.C. 163), when they threw off the Syrian yoke.</description>
    <description>In the year B.C. 68, Palestine was reduced by Pompey the Great to a Roman province. He laid the walls of the city in ruins, and massacred some twelve thousand of the inhabitants. He left the temple, however, unijured. About twenty-five years after this the Jews revolted and cast off the Roman yoke. They were however, subdued by Herod the Great (q.v.). The city and the temple were destroyed, and many of the inhabitants were put to death. About B.C. 20, Herod proceeded to rebuild the city and restore the ruined temple, which in about nine years and a half was so far completed that the sacred services could be resumed in it (<reflink target="XXX">comp. John 2:20</reflink>). He was succeeded by his son Archelaus, who was deprived of his power, however, by Augustus, A.D. 6, when Palestine became a Roman province, ruled by Roman governors or procurators. Pontius Pilate was the fifth of these procurators. He was appointed to his office A.D. 25.</description>
    <description>Exclusive of Idumea, the kingdom of Herod the Great comprehended the whole of the country originally divided among the twelve tribes, which he divided into four provinces or districts. This division was recognized so long as Palestine was under the Roman dominion. These four provinces were, (1) Judea, the southern portion of the country; (2) Samaria, the middle province, the northern boundary of which ran along the hills to the south of the plain of Esdraelon; (3) Galilee, the northern province; and (4) Peraea (a Greek name meaning the "opposite country"), the country lying east of the Jordan and the Dead Sea. This province was subdivided into these districts, (1) Peraea proper, lying between the rivers Arnon and Jabbok; (2) Galaaditis (Gilead); (3) Batanaea; (4) Gaulonitis (Jaulan); (5) Ituraea or Auranitis, the ancient Bashan; (6) Trachonitis; (7) Abilene; (8) Decapolis, i.e., the region of the ten cities. The whole territory of Palestine, including the portions alloted to the trans-Jordan tribes, extended to about eleven thousand square miles. Recent exploration has shown the territory on the west of Jordan alone to be six thousand square miles in extent, the size of the principality of Wales.</description>

  <item id="Pallu">
    <description>separated, the second son of Reuben (<reflink target="XXX">1 Chr. 5:3</reflink>); called Phallu, Gen. 46:9. He was the father of the Phalluites (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 6:14; Num. 26:5, 8</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Palm tree">
    <description>(Heb. tamar), the date-palm characteristic of Palestine. It is described as "flourishing" (<reflink target="XXX">Ps. 92:12</reflink>), tall (<reflink target="XXX">Cant. 7:7</reflink>), "upright" (<reflink target="XXX">Jer. 10:5</reflink>). Its branches are a symbol of victory (<reflink target="XXX">Rev. 7:9</reflink>). "Rising with slender stem 40 or 50, at times even 80, feet aloft, its only branches, the feathery, snow-like, pale-green fronds from 6 to 12 feet long, bending from its top, the palm attracts the eye wherever it is seen." The whole land of Palestine was called by the Greeks and Romans Phoenicia, i.e., "the land of palms." Tadmor in the desert was called by the Greeks and Romans Palmyra, i.e., "the city of palms." The finest specimens of this tree grew at Jericho (<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 34:3</reflink>) and Engedi and along the banks of the Jordan. Branches of the palm tree were carried at the feast of Tabernacles (<reflink target="XXX">Lev. 23:40</reflink>). At our Lord's triumphal entrance into Jerusalem the crowds took palm branches, and went forth to meet him, crying, "Hosanna: Blessed is the King of Israel that cometh in the name of the Lord" (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 21:8; John 12:13</reflink>). (<see target="x-self">See DATE.</see>)</description>

  </item>
  <item id="Palmer-worm">
    <description>(Heb. gazam). The English word may denote either a caterpillar (as rendered by the LXX.), which wanders like a palmer or pilgrim, or which travels like pilgrims in bands (<reflink target="XXX">Joel 1:4; 2:25</reflink>), the wingless locusts, or the migratory locust in its larva state.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Palsy">
    <description>a shorter form of "paralysis." Many persons thus afflicted were cured by our Lord (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 4:24; 8:5-13; 9:2-7; Mark 2:3-11; Luke 7:2-10; John 5:5-7</reflink>) and the apostles (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 8:7; 9:33, 34</reflink>).</description>

  <item id="Pamphylia">
    <description>Paul and his company, loosing from Paphos, sailed north-west and came to Perga, the capital of Pamphylia (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 13:13, 14</reflink>), a province about the middle of the southern sea-board of Asia Minor. It lay between Lycia on the west and Cilicia on the east. There were strangers from Pamphylia at Jerusalem on the day of Pentecost (2:10).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Pan">
    <description>a vessel of metal or earthenware used in culinary operations; a cooking-pan or frying-pan frequently referred to in the Old Testament (<reflink target="XXX">Lev. 2:5; 6:21; Num. 11:8; 1 Sam. 2:14, etc.</reflink>).</description>
    <description>The "ash-pans" mentioned in Ex. 27:3 were made of copper, and were used in connection with the altar of burnt-offering. The "iron pan" mentioned in Ezek. 4:3 (marg., "flat plate " or "slice") was probably a mere plate of iron used for baking. The "fire-pans" of Ex. 27:3 were fire-shovels used for taking up coals. The same Hebrew word is rendered "snuff-dishes" (25:38; 37:23) and "censers" (<reflink target="XXX">Lev. 10:1; 16:12; Num. 4:14, etc.</reflink>). These were probably simply metal vessels employed for carrying burning embers from the brazen altar to the altar of incense.</description>
    <description>The "frying-pan" mentioned in Lev. 2:7; 7:9 was a pot for boiling.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Pannag">
    <description>(<reflink target="XXX">Ezek. 27:17; marg. R.V., "perhaps a kind of confection"</reflink>) the Jews explain as the name of a kind of sweet pastry. Others take it as the name of some place, identifying it with Pingi, on the road between Damascus and Baalbec. "Pannaga" is the Sanscrit name of an aromatic plant (<reflink target="XXX">comp. Gen. 43:11</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Paper">
    <description>The expression in the Authorized Version (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 19:7</reflink>), "the paper reeds by the brooks," is in the Revised Version more correctly "the meadows by the Nile." The words undoubtedly refer to a grassy place on the banks of the Nile fit for pasturage.</description>
    <description>In 2 John 1:12 the word is used in its proper sense. The material so referred to was manufactured from the papyrus, and hence its name. The papyrus (Heb. gome) was a kind of bulrush (q.v.). It is mentioned by Job (8:11) and Isaiah (35:7). It was used for many purposes. This plant (Papyrus Nilotica) is now unknown in Egypt; no trace of it can be found. The unaccountable disappearance of this plant from Egypt was foretold by Isaiah (19:6, 7) as a part of the divine judgment on that land. The most extensive papyrus growths now known are in the marshes at the northern end of the lake of Merom.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Paphos">
    <description>the capital of the island of Cyprus, and therefore the residence of the Roman governor. It was visited by Paul and Barnabas on their first missionary tour (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 13:6</reflink>). It is new Paphos which is here meant. It lay on the west coast of the island, about 8 miles north of old Paphos. Its modern name is Baffa.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Parable">
    <description>(Gr. parabole), a placing beside; a comparison; equivalent to the Heb. mashal, a similitude. In the Old Testament this is used to denote (1) a proverb (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 10:12; 24:13; 2 Chr. 7:20</reflink>), (2) a prophetic utterance (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 23:7; Ezek. 20:49</reflink>), (3) an enigmatic saying (<reflink target="XXX">Ps. 78:2; Prov. 1:6</reflink>). In the New Testament, (1) a proverb (<reflink target="XXX">Mark 7:17; Luke 4:23</reflink>), (2) a typical emblem (<reflink target="XXX">Heb. 9:9; 11:19</reflink>), (3) a similitude or allegory (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 15:15; 24:32; Mark 3:23; Luke 5:36; 14:7</reflink>); (4) ordinarily, in a more restricted sense, a comparison of earthly with heavenly things, "an earthly story with a heavenly meaning," as in the parables of our Lord.</description>
    <description>Instruction by parables has been in use from the earliest times. A large portion of our Lord's public teaching consisted of parables. He himself explains his reasons for this in his answer to the inquiry of the disciples, "Why speakest thou to them in parables?" (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 13:13-15; Mark 4:11, 12; Luke 8:9, 10</reflink>). He followed in so doing the rule of the divine procedures, as recorded in Matt. 13:13.</description>
    <description>The parables uttered by our Lord are all recorded in the synoptical (i.e., the first three) Gospels. The fourth Gospel contains no parable properly so called, although the illustration of the good shepherd (<reflink target="XXX">John 10:1-16</reflink>) has all the essential features of a parable. (<see target="x-self">See List of Parables in Appendix.</see>)</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Paradise">
    <description>a Persian word (pardes), properly meaning a "pleasure-ground" or "park" or "king's garden." (<see target="x-self">See EDEN.</see>) It came in course of time to be used as a name for the world of happiness and rest hereafter (<reflink target="XXX">Luke 23:43; 2 Cor. 12:4; Rev. 2:7</reflink>). For "garden" in Gen. 2:8 the LXX. has "paradise."</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Parah">
    <description>the heifer, a town in Benjamin (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 18:23</reflink>), supposed to be identical with the ruins called Far'ah, about 6 miles north-east of Jerusalem, in the Wady Far'ah, which is a branch of the Wady Kelt.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Paran">
    <description>abounding in foliage, or abounding in caverns, (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 21:21</reflink>), a desert tract forming the north-eastern division of the peninsula of Sinai, lying between the 'Arabah on the east and the wilderness of Shur on the west. It is intersected in a north-western direction by the Wady el-'Arish. It bears the modern name of Badiet et-Tih, i.e., "the desert of the wanderings." This district, through which the children of Israel wandered, lay three days' march from Sinai (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 10:12, 33</reflink>). From Kadesh, in this wilderness, spies (q.v.) were sent to spy the land (13:3, 26). Here, long afterwards, David found refuge from Saul (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 25:1, 4</reflink>).</description>

    <description>(<reflink target="XXX">1 Chr. 26:18</reflink>), a place apparently connected with the temple, probably a "suburb" (q.v.), as the word is rendered in 2 Kings 23:11; a space between the temple wall and the wall of the court; an open portico into which the chambers of the official persons opened (<reflink target="XXX">1 Chr. 26:18</reflink>).</description>

  <item id="Pardon">
    <description>the forgiveness of sins granted freely (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 43:25</reflink>), readily (<reflink target="XXX">Neh. 9:17; Ps. 86:5</reflink>), abundantly (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 55:7; Rom. 5:20</reflink>). Pardon is an act of a sovereign, in pure sovereignty, granting simply a remission of the penalty due to sin, but securing neither honour nor reward to the pardoned. Justification (q.v.), on the other hand, is the act of a judge, and not of a sovereign, and includes pardon and, at the same time, a title to all the rewards and blessings promised in the covenant of life.</description>

  <item id="Parlour">
    <description>(from the Fr. parler, "to speak") denotes an "audience chamber," but that is not the import of the Hebrew word so rendered. It corresponds to what the Turks call a kiosk, as in Judg. 3:20 (the "summer parlour"), or as in the margin of the Revised Version ("the upper chamber of cooling"), a small room built on the roof of the house, with open windows to catch the breeze, and having a door communicating with the outside by which persons seeking an audience may be admitted. While Eglon was resting in such a parlour, Ehud, under pretence of having a message from God to him, was admitted into his presence, and murderously plunged his dagger into his body (21, 22).</description>
    <description>The "inner parlours" in 1 Chr. 28:11 were the small rooms or chambers which Solomon built all round two sides and one end of the temple (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 6:5</reflink>), "side chambers;" or they may have been, as some think, the porch and the holy place.</description>
    <description>In 1 Sam. 9:22 the Revised Version reads "guest chamber," a chamber at the high place specially used for sacrificial feasts.</description>

  <item id="Partridge">
    <description>(Heb. kore, i.e., "caller"). This bird, unlike our own partridge, is distinguished by "its ringing call-note, which in early morning echoes from cliff to cliff amidst the barrenness of the wilderness of Judea and the glens of the forest of Carmel" hence its Hebrew name. This name occurs only twice in Scripture.</description>
    <description>In 1 Sam. 26:20 "David alludes to the mode of chase practised now, as of old, when the partridge, continuously chased, was at length, when fatigued, knocked down by sticks thrown along the ground." It endeavours to save itself "by running, in preference to flight, unless when suddenly started. It is not an inhabitant of the plain or the corn-field, but of rocky hill-sides" (Tristram's Nat. Hist.).</description>
    <description>In Jer. 17:11 the prophet is illustrating the fact that riches unlawfully acquired are precarious and short-lived. The exact nature of the illustration cannot be precisely determined. Some interpret the words as meaning that the covetous man will be as surely disappointed as the partridge which gathers in eggs, not of her own laying, and is unable to hatch them; others (Tristram), with more probability, as denoting that the man who enriches himself by unjust means "will as surely be disappointed as the partridge which commences to sit, but is speedily robbed of her hopes of a brood" by her eggs being stolen away from her.</description>
    <description>The commonest partridge in Palestine is the Caccabis saxatilis, the Greek partridge. The partridge of the wilderness (Ammo-perdix heyi) is a smaller species. Both are essentially mountain and rock birds, thus differing from the English partridge, which loves cultivated fields.</description>

  <item id="Pashur">
    <description>release. (1.) The son of Immer (probably the same as Amariah, Neh. 10:3; 12:2), the head of one of the priestly courses, was "chief governor [Heb. paqid nagid, meaning "deputy governor"] of the temple" (<reflink target="XXX">Jer. 20:1, 2</reflink>). At this time the _nagid_, or "governor," of the temple was Seraiah the high priest (<reflink target="XXX">1 Chr. 6:14</reflink>), and Pashur was his _paqid_, or "deputy." Enraged at the plainness with which Jeremiah uttered his solemn warnings of coming judgements, because of the abounding iniquity of the times, Pashur ordered the temple police to seize him, and after inflicting on him corporal punishment (forty stripes save one, Deut. 25:3; comp. 2 Cor. 11:24), to put him in the stocks in the high gate of Benjamin, where he remained all night. On being set free in the morning, Jeremiah went to Pashur (<reflink target="XXX">Jer. 20:3, 5</reflink>), and announced to him that God had changed his name to Magor-missabib, i.e., "terror on every side." The punishment that fell upon him was probably remorse, when he saw the ruin he had brought upon his country by advising a close alliance with Egypt in opposition to the counsels of Jeremiah (20:4-6). He was carried captive to Babylon, and died there.</description>
    <description>(2.) A priest sent by king Zedekiah to Jeremiah to inquire of the Lord (<reflink target="XXX">1 Chr. 24:9; Jer. 21:1; 38:1-6</reflink>). He advised that the prophet should be put to death.</description>

  <item id="Passage">
    <description>denotes in Josh. 22:11, as is generally understood, the place where the children of Israel passed over Jordan. The words "the passage of" are, however, more correctly rendered "by the side of," or "at the other side of," thus designating the position of the great altar erected by the eastern tribes on their return home. This word also designates the fords of the Jordan to the south of the Sea of Galilee (<reflink target="XXX">Judg. 12:5, 6</reflink>), and a pass or rocky defile (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 13:23; 14:4</reflink>). "Passages" in Jer. 22:20 is in the Revised Version more correctly "Abarim" (q.v.), a proper name.</description>

  <item id="Passover">
    <description>the name given to the chief of the three great historical annual festivals of the Jews. It was kept in remembrance of the Lord's passing over the houses of the Israelites (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 12:13</reflink>) when the first born of all the Egyptians were destroyed. It is called also the "feast of unleavened bread" (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 23:15; Mark 14:1; Acts 12:3</reflink>), because during its celebration no leavened bread was to be eaten or even kept in the household (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 12:15</reflink>). The word afterwards came to denote the lamb that was slain at the feast (<reflink target="XXX">Mark 14:12-14; 1 Cor. 5:7</reflink>).</description>
    <description>A detailed account of the institution of this feast is given in Ex. 12 and 13. It was afterwards incorporated in the ceremonial law (<reflink target="XXX">Lev. 23:4-8</reflink>) as one of the great festivals of the nation. In after times many changes seem to have taken place as to the mode of its celebration as compared with its first celebration (<reflink target="XXX">comp. Deut. 16:2, 5, 6; 2 Chr. 30:16; Lev. 23:10-14; Num. 9:10, 11; 28:16-24</reflink>). Again, the use of wine (<reflink target="XXX">Luke 22:17, 20</reflink>), of sauce with the bitter herbs (<reflink target="XXX">John 13:26</reflink>), and the service of praise were introduced.</description>
    <description>There is recorded only one celebration of this feast between the Exodus and the entrance into Canaan, namely, that mentioned in Num. 9:5. (<see target="x-self">See JOSIAH.</see>) It was primarily a commemorative ordinance, reminding the children of Israel of their deliverance out of Egypt; but it was, no doubt, also a type of the great deliverance wrought by the Messiah for all his people from the doom of death on account of sin, and from the bondage of sin itself, a worse than Egyptian bondage (<reflink target="XXX">1 Cor. 5:7; John 1:29; 19:32-36; 1 Pet. 1:19; Gal. 4:4, 5</reflink>). The appearance of Jerusalem on the occasion of the Passover in the time of our Lord is thus fittingly described: "The city itself and the neighbourhood became more and more crowded as the feast approached, the narrow streets and dark arched bazaars showing the same throng of men of all nations as when Jesus had first visited Jerusalem as a boy. Even the temple offered a strange sight at this season, for in parts of the outer courts a wide space was covered with pens for sheep, goats, and cattle to be used for offerings. Sellers shouted the merits of their beasts, sheep bleated, oxen lowed. Sellers of doves also had a place set apart for them. Potters offered a choice from huge stacks of clay dishes and ovens for roasting and eating the Passover lamb. Booths for wine, oil, salt, and all else needed for sacrifices invited customers. Persons going to and from the city shortened their journey by crossing the temple grounds, often carrying burdens...Stalls to change foreign money into the shekel of the temple, which alone could be paid to the priests, were numerous, the whole confusion making the sanctuary like a noisy market" (Geikie's Life of Christ).</description>

It was on this island, to which John was banished by the emperor Domitian (A.D. 95), that he received from God the wondrous revelation recorded in his book. This has naturally invested it with the deepest interest for all time. It is now called Patmo. (<see target="x-self">See JOHN.</see>)</description>

  <item id="Patriarch">
    <description>a name employed in the New Testament with reference to Abraham (<reflink target="XXX">Heb. 7:4</reflink>), the sons of Jacob (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 7:8, 9</reflink>), and to David (2:29). This name is generally applied to the progenitors of families or "heads of the fathers" (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 14:1</reflink>) mentioned in Scripture, and they are spoken of as antediluvian (from Adam to Noah) and post-diluvian (from Noah to Jacob) patriachs. But the expression "the patriarch," by way of eminence, is applied to the twelve sons of Jacob, or to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.</description>
    <description>"Patriachal longevity presents itself as one of the most striking of the facts concerning mankind which the early history of the Book of Genesis places before us...There is a large amount of consentient tradition to the effect that the life of man was originally far more prolonged than it is at present, extending to at least several hundred years. The Babylonians, Egyptians, and Chinese exaggerated these hundreds into thousands. The Greeks and Romans, with more moderation, limited human life within a thousand or eight hundred years. The Hindus still farther shortened the term. Their books taught that in the first age of the world man was free from diseases, and lived ordinarily four hundred years; in the second age the term of life was reduced from four hundred to three hundred; in the third it became two hundred; in the fourth and last it was brought down to one hundred" (Rawlinson's Historical Illustrations).</description>

  <item id="Paul">
    <description>=Saul (q.v.) was born about the same time as our Lord. His circumcision-name was Saul, and probably the name Paul was also given to him in infancy "for use in the Gentile world," as "Saul" would be his Hebrew home-name. He was a native of Tarsus, the capital of Cilicia, a Roman province in the south-east of Asia Minor. That city stood on the banks of the river Cydnus, which was navigable thus far; hence it became a centre of extensive commercial traffic with many countries along the shores of the Mediterranean, as well as with the countries of central Asia Minor. It thus became a city distinguished for the wealth of its inhabitants.</description>
    <description>Tarsus was also the seat of a famous university, higher in reputation even than the universities of Athens and Alexandria, the only others that then existed. Here Saul was born, and here he spent his youth, doubtless enjoying the best education his native city could afford. His father was of the straitest sect of the Jews, a Pharisee, of the tribe of Benjamin, of pure and unmixed Jewish blood (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 23:6; Phil. 3:5</reflink>). We learn nothing regarding his mother; but there is reason to conclude that she was a pious woman, and that, like-minded with her husband, she exercised all a mother influence in moulding the character of her son, so that he could afterwards speak of himself as being, from his youth up, "touching the righteousness which is in the law, blameless" (<reflink target="XXX">Phil. 3:6</reflink>).</description>
    <description>We read of his sister and his sister's son (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 23:16</reflink>), and of other relatives (<reflink target="XXX">Rom. 16:7, 11, 12</reflink>). Though a Jew, his father was a Roman citizen. How he obtained this privilege we are not informed. "It might be bought, or won by distinguished service to the state, or acquired in several other ways; at all events, his son was freeborn. It was a valuable privilege, and one that was to prove of great use to Paul, although not in the way in which his father might have been expected to desire him to make use of it." Perhaps the most natural career for the youth to follow was that of a merchant. "But it was decided that...he should go to college and become a rabbi, that is, a minister, a teacher, and a lawyer all in one."</description>
    <description>According to Jewish custom, however, he learned a trade before entering on the more direct preparation for the sacred profession. The trade he acquired was the making of tents from goats' hair cloth, a trade which was one of the commonest in Tarsus.</description>
    <description>His preliminary education having been completed, Saul was sent, when about thirteen years of age probably, to the great Jewish school of sacred learning at Jerusalem as a student of the law. Here he became a pupil of the celebrated rabbi Gamaliel, and here he spent many years in an elaborate study of the Scriptures and of the many questions concerning them with which the rabbis exercised themselves. During these years of diligent study he lived "in all good conscience," unstained by the vices of that great city.</description>
    <description>After the period of his student-life expired, he probably left Jerusalem for Tarsus, where he may have been engaged in connection with some synagogue for some years. But we find him back again at Jerusalem very soon after the death of our Lord. Here he now learned the particulars regarding the crucifixion, and the rise of the new sect of the "Nazarenes."</description>
    <description>For some two years after Pentecost, Christianity was quietly spreading its influence in Jerusalem. At length Stephen, one of the seven deacons, gave forth more public and aggressive testimony that Jesus was the Messiah, and this led to much excitement among the Jews and much disputation in their synagogues. Persecution arose against Stephen and the followers of Christ generally, in which Saul of Tarsus took a prominent part. He was at this time probably a member of the great Sanhedrin, and became the active leader in the furious persecution by which the rulers then sought to exterminate Christianity.</description>
    <description>But the object of this persecution also failed. "They that were scattered abroad went everywhere preaching the word." The anger of the persecutor was thereby kindled into a fiercer flame. Hearing that fugitives had taken refuge in Damascus, he obtained from the chief priest letters authorizing him to proceed thither on his persecuting career. This was a long journey of about 130 miles, which would occupy perhaps six days, during which, with his few attendants, he steadily went onward, "breathing out threatenings and slaughter." But the crisis of his life was at hand. He had reached the last stage of his journey, and was within sight of Damascus. As he and his companions rode on, suddenly at mid-day a brilliant light shone round them, and Saul was laid prostrate in terror on the ground, a voice sounding in his ears, "Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?" The risen Saviour was there, clothed in the vesture of his glorified humanity. In answer to the anxious inquiry of the stricken persecutor, "Who art thou, Lord?" he said, "I am Jesus whom thou persecutest" (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 9:5; 22:8; 26:15</reflink>).</description>
    <description>This was the moment of his conversion, the most solemn in all his life. Blinded by the dazzling light (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 9:8</reflink>), his companions led him into the city, where, absorbed in deep thought for three days, he neither ate nor drank (9:11). Ananias, a disciple living in Damascus, was informed by a vision of the change that had happened to Saul, and was sent to him to open his eyes and admit him by baptism into the Christian church (9:11-16). The whole purpose of his life was now permanently changed.</description>
    <description>Immediately after his conversion he retired into the solitudes of Arabia (<reflink target="XXX">Gal. 1:17</reflink>), perhaps of "Sinai in Arabia," for the purpose, probably, of devout study and meditation on the marvellous revelation that had been made to him. "A veil of thick darkness hangs over this visit to Arabia. Of the scenes among which he moved, of the thoughts and occupations which engaged him while there, of all the circumstances of a crisis which must have shaped the whole tenor of his after-life, absolutely nothing is known. 'Immediately,' says St. Paul, 'I went away into Arabia.' The historian passes over the incident [comp. Acts 9:23 and 1 Kings 11:38, 39]. It is a mysterious pause, a moment of suspense, in the apostle's history, a breathless calm, which ushers in the tumultuous storm of his active missionary life." Coming back, after three years, to Damascus, he began to preach the gospel "boldly in the name of Jesus" (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 9:27</reflink>), but was soon obliged to flee (9:25; 2 Cor. 11:33) from the Jews and betake himself to Jerusalem. Here he tarried for three weeks, but was again forced to flee (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 9:28, 29</reflink>) from persecution. He now returned to his native Tarsus (<reflink target="XXX">Gal. 1:21</reflink>), where, for probably about three years, we lose sight of him. The time had not yet come for his entering on his great life-work of preaching the gospel to the Gentiles.</description>
    <description>At length the city of Antioch, the capital of Syria, became the scene of great Christian activity. There the gospel gained a firm footing, and the cause of Christ prospered. Barnabas (q.v.), who had been sent from Jerusalem to superintend the work at Antioch, found it too much for him, and remembering Saul, he set out to Tarsus to seek for him. He readily responded to the call thus addressed to him, and came down to Antioch, which for "a whole year" became the scene of his labours, which were crowned with great success. The disciples now, for the first time, were called "Christians" (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 11:26</reflink>).</description>
    <description>The church at Antioch now proposed to send out missionaries to the Gentiles, and Saul and Barnabas, with John Mark as their attendant, were chosen for this work. This was a great epoch in the history of the church. Now the disciples began to give effect to the Master's command: "Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature."</description>
    <description>The three missionaries went forth on the first missionary tour. They sailed from Seleucia, the seaport of Antioch, across to Cyprus, some 80 miles to the south-west. Here at Paphos, Sergius Paulus, the Roman proconsul, was converted, and now Saul took the lead, and was ever afterwards called Paul. The missionaries now crossed to the mainland, and then proceeded 6 or 7 miles up the river Cestrus to Perga (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 13:13</reflink>), where John Mark deserted the work and returned to Jerusalem. The two then proceeded about 100 miles inland, passing through Pamphylia, Pisidia, and Lycaonia. The towns mentioned in this tour are the Pisidian Antioch, where Paul delivered his first address of which we have any record (13:16-51; comp. 10:30-43), Iconium, Lystra, and Derbe. They returned by the same route to see and encourage the converts they had made, and ordain elders in every city to watch over the churches which had been gathered. From Perga they sailed direct for Antioch, from which they had set out.</description>
    <description>After remaining "a long time", probably till A.D. 50 or 51, in Antioch, a great controversy broke out in the church there regarding the relation of the Gentiles to the Mosaic law. For the purpose of obtaining a settlement of this question, Paul and Barnabas were sent as deputies to consult the church at Jerusalem. The council or synod which was there held (Acts 15) decided against the Judaizing party; and the deputies, accompanied by Judas and Silas, returned to Antioch, bringing with them the decree of the council.</description>
    <description>After a short rest at Antioch, Paul said to Barnabas: "Let us go again and visit our brethren in every city where we have preached the word of the Lord, and see how they do." Mark proposed again to accompany them; but Paul refused to allow him to go. Barnabas was resolved to take Mark, and thus he and Paul had a sharp contention. They separated, and never again met. Paul, however, afterwards speaks with honour of Barnabas, and sends for Mark to come to him at Rome (<reflink target="XXX">Col. 4:10; 2 Tim. 4:11</reflink>).</description>
    <description>Paul took with him Silas, instead of Barnabas, and began his second missionary journey about A.D. 51. This time he went by land, revisiting the churches he had already founded in Asia. But he longed to enter into "regions beyond," and still went forward through Phrygia and Galatia (16:6). Contrary to his intention, he was constrained to linger in Galatia (q.v.), on account of some bodily affliction (<reflink target="XXX">Gal. 4:13, 14</reflink>). Bithynia, a populous province on the shore of the Black Sea, lay now before him, and he wished to enter it; but the way was shut, the Spirit in some manner guiding him in another direction, till he came down to the shores of the AEgean and arrived at Troas, on the north-western coast of Asia Minor (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 16:8</reflink>). Of this long journey from Antioch to Troas we have no account except some references to it in his Epistle to the Galatians (4:13).</description>
    <description>As he waited at Troas for indications of the will of God as to his future movements, he saw, in the vision of the night, a man from the opposite shores of Macedonia standing before him, and heard him cry, "Come over, and help us" (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 16:9</reflink>). Paul recognized in this vision a message from the Lord, and the very next day set sail across the Hellespont, which separated him from Europe, and carried the tidings of the gospel into the Western world. In Macedonia, churches were planted in Philippi, Thessalonica, and Berea. Leaving this province, Paul passed into Achaia, "the paradise of genius and renown." He reached Athens, but quitted it after, probably, a brief sojourn (17:17-31). The Athenians had received him with cold disdain, and he never visited that city again. He passed over to Corinth, the seat of the Roman government of Achaia, and remained there a year and a half, labouring with much success. While at Corinth, he wrote his two epistles to the church of Thessalonica, his earliest apostolic letters, and then sailed for Syria, that he might be in time to keep the feast of Pentecost at Jerusalem. He was accompanied by Aquila and Priscilla, whom he left at Ephesus, at which he touched, after a voyage of thirteen or fifteen days. He landed at Caesarea, and went up to Jerusalem, and having "saluted the church" there, and kept the feast, he left for Antioch, where he abode "some time" (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 18:20-23</reflink>).</description>
    <description>He then began his third missionary tour. He journeyed by land in the "upper coasts" (the more eastern parts) of Asia Minor, and at length made his way to Ephesus, where he tarried for no less than three years, engaged in ceaseless Christian labour. "This city was at the time the Liverpool of the Mediterranean. It possessed a splendid harbour, in which was concentrated the traffic of the sea which was then the highway of the nations; and as Liverpool has behind her the great towns of Lancashire, so had Ephesus behind and around her such cities as those mentioned along with her in the epistles to the churches in the book of Revelation, Smyrna, Pergamos, Thyatira, Sardis, Philadelphia, and Laodicea. It was a city of vast wealth, and it was given over to every kind of pleasure, the fame of its theatres and race-course being world-wide" (Stalker's Life of St. Paul). Here a "great door and effectual" was opened to the apostle. His fellow-labourers aided him in his work, carrying the gospel to Colosse and Laodicea and other places which they could reach.</description>
    <description>Very shortly before his departure from Ephesus, the apostle wrote his First Epistle to the Corinthians (q.v.). The silversmiths, whose traffic in the little images which they made was in danger (<see target="x-self">see DEMETRIUS</see>), organized a riot against Paul, and he left the city, and proceeded to Troas (<reflink target="XXX">2 Cor. 2:12</reflink>), whence after some time he went to meet Titus in Macedonia. Here, in consequence of the report Titus brought from Corinth, he wrote his second epistle to that church. Having spent probably most of the summer and autumn in Macedonia, visiting the churches there, specially the churches of Philippi, Thessalonica, and Berea, probably penetrating into the interior, to the shores of the Adriatic (<reflink target="XXX">Rom. 15:19</reflink>), he then came into Greece, where he abode three month, spending probably the greater part of this time in Corinth (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 20:2</reflink>). During his stay in this city he wrote his Epistle to the Galatians, and also the great Epistle to the Romans. At the end of the three months he left Achaia for Macedonia, thence crossed into Asia Minor, and touching at Miletus, there addressed the Ephesian presbyters, whom he had sent for to meet him (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 20:17</reflink>), and then sailed for Tyre, finally reaching Jerusalem, probably in the spring of A.D. 58.</description>
    <description>While at Jerusalem, at the feast of Pentecost, he was almost murdered by a Jewish mob in the temple. (See TEMPLE, HEROD'S</description>
    <description>At the end of these two years Felix (q.v.) was succeeded in the governorship of Palestine by Porcius Festus, before whom the apostle was again heard. But judging it right at this crisis to claim the privilege of a Roman citizen, he appealed to the emperor (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 25:11</reflink>). Such an appeal could not be disregarded, and Paul was at once sent on to Rome under the charge of one Julius, a centurion of the "Augustan cohort." After a long and perilous voyage, he at length reached the imperial city in the early spring, probably, of A.D. 61. Here he was permitted to occupy his own hired house, under constant military custody. This privilege was accorded to him, no doubt, because he was a Roman citizen, and as such could not be put into prison without a trial. The soldiers who kept guard over Paul were of course changed at frequent intervals, and thus he had the opportunity of preaching the gospel to many of them during these "two whole years," and with the blessed result of spreading among the imperial guards, and even in Caesar's household, an interest in the truth (<reflink target="XXX">Phil. 1:13</reflink>). His rooms were resorted to by many anxious inquirers, both Jews and Gentiles (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 28:23, 30, 31</reflink>), and thus his imprisonment "turned rather to the furtherance of the gospel," and his "hired house" became the centre of a gracious influence which spread over the whole city. According to a Jewish tradition, it was situated on the borders of the modern Ghetto, which has been the Jewish quarters in Rome from the time of Pompey to the present day. During this period the apostle wrote his epistles to the Colossians, Ephesians, Philippians, and to Philemon, and probably also to the Hebrews.</description>
    <description>This first imprisonment came at length to a close, Paul having been acquitted, probably because no witnesses appeared against him. Once more he set out on his missionary labours, probably visiting western and eastern Europe and Asia Minor. During this period of freedom he wrote his First Epistle to Timothy and his Epistle to Titus. The year of his release was signalized by the burning of Rome, which Nero saw fit to attribute to the Christians. A fierce persecution now broke out against the Christians. Paul was siezed, and once more conveyed to Rome a prisoner. During this imprisonment he probably wrote the Second Epistle to Timothy, the last he ever wrote. "There can be little doubt that he appered again at Nero's bar, and this time the charge did not break down. In all history there is not a more startling illustration of the irony of human life than this scene of Paul at the bar of Nero. On the judgment-seat, clad in the imperial purple, sat a man who, in a bad world, had attained the eminence of being the very worst and meanest being in it, a man stained with every crime, a man whose whole being was so steeped in every nameable and unnameable vice, that body and soul of him were, as some one said at the time, nothing but a compound of mud and blood; and in the prisoner's dock stood the best man the world possessed, his hair whitened with labours for the good of men and the glory of God. The trial ended: Paul was condemned, and delivered over to the executioner. He was led out of the city, with a crowd of the lowest rabble at his heels. The fatal spot was reached; he knelt beside the block; the headsman's axe gleamed in the sun and fell; and the head of the apostle of the world rolled down in the dust" (probably A.D. 66), four years before the fall of Jerusalem.</description>

    <description>It was the custom of the Roman governors to erect their tribunals in open places, as the market-place, the circus, or even the highway. Pilate caused his seat of judgment to be set down in a place called "the Pavement" (<reflink target="XXX">John 19:13</reflink>) i.e., a place paved with a mosaic of coloured stones. It was probably a place thus prepared in front of the "judgment hall." (See GABBATHA</description>

Seventeen years after this he entered into an alliance with Rezin, king of Syria, and took part with him in besieging Jerusalem (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 15:37; 16:5</reflink>). But Tiglath-pilser, who was in alliance with Ahaz, king of Judah, came up against Pekah, and carried away captive many of the inhabitants of his kingdom (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 15:29</reflink>). This was the beginning of the "Captivity." Soon after this Pekah was put to death by Hoshea, the son of Elah, who usurped the throne (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 15:30; 16:1-9. Comp.

It is of an enormous size, being about 6 feet long, with wings stretching out over 12 feet. The Hebrew name (kaath, i.e., "vomiter") of this bird is incorrectly rendered "cormorant" in the Authorized Version of Isa. 34:11 and Zeph. 2:14, but correctly in the Revised Version. It receives its Hebrew name from its habit of storing in its pouch large quantities of fish, which it disgorges when it feeds its young. Two species are found on the Syrian coast, the Pelicanus onocrotalus, or white pelican, and the Pelicanus crispus, or Dalmatian pelican.</description>

It was the daily pay of a Roman soldier in the time of Christ. In the reign of Edward III. an English penny was a labourer's day's wages.

  <item id="Pentateuch">
    <description>the five-fold volume, consisting of the first five books of the Old Testament. This word does not occur in Scripture, nor is it certainly known when the roll was thus divided into five portions Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy. Probably that was done by the LXX. translators. Some modern critics speak of a Hexateuch, introducing the Book of Joshua as one of the group. But this book is of an entirely different character from the other books, and has a different author. It stands by itself as the first of a series of historical books beginning with the entrance of the Israelites into Canaan. (<see target="x-self">See JOSHUA.</see>)</description>
    <description>The books composing the Pentateuch are properly but one book, the "Law of Moses," the "Book of the Law of Moses," the "Book of Moses," or, as the Jews designate it, the "Torah" or "Law." That in its present form it "proceeds from a single author is proved by its plan and aim, according to which its whole contents refer to the covenant concluded between Jehovah and his people, by the instrumentality of Moses, in such a way that everything before his time is perceived to be preparatory to this fact, and all the rest to be the development of it. Nevertheless, this unity has not been stamped upon it as a matter of necessity by the latest redactor: it has been there from the beginning, and is visible in the first plan and in the whole execution of the work.", Keil, Einl. i.d. A. T.</description>
    <description>A certain school of critics have set themselves to reconstruct the books of the Old Testament. By a process of "scientific study" they have discovered that the so-called historical books of the Old Testament are not history at all, but a miscellaneous collection of stories, the inventions of many different writers, patched together by a variety of editors! As regards the Pentateuch, they are not ashamed to attribute fraud, and even conspiracy, to its authors, who sought to find acceptance to their work which was composed partly in the age of Josiah, and partly in that of Ezra and Nehemiah, by giving it out to be the work of Moses! This is not the place to enter into the details of this controversy. We may say frankly, however, that we have no faith in this "higher criticism." It degrades the books of the Old Testament below the level of fallible human writings, and the arguments on which its speculations are built are altogether untenable.</description>
    <description>The evidences in favour of the Mosaic authorship of the Pentateuch are conclusive. We may thus state some of them briefly:</description>
    <description>(1.) These books profess to have been written by Moses in the name of God (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 17:14; 24:3, 4, 7; 32:7-10, 30-34; 34:27; Lev. 26:46; 27:34; Deut. 31:9, 24, 25</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(2.) This also is the uniform and persistent testimony of the Jews of all sects in all ages and countries (<reflink target="XXX">comp. Josh. 8:31, 32; 1 Kings 2:3; Jer. 7:22; Ezra 6:18; Neh. 8:1; Mal. 4:4; Matt. 22:24; Acts 15:21</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(3.) Our Lord plainly taught the Mosaic authorship of these books (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 5:17, 18; 19:8; 22:31, 32; 23:2; Mark 10:9; 12:26; Luke 16:31; 20:37; 24:26, 27, 44; John 3:14; 5:45, 46, 47; 6:32, 49; 7:19, 22</reflink>). In the face of this fact, will any one venture to allege either that Christ was ignorant of the composition of the Bible, or that, knowing the true state of the case, he yet encouraged the people in the delusion they clung to?</description>
    <description>(4.) From the time of Joshua down to the time of Ezra there is, in the intermediate historical books, a constant reference to the Pentateuch as the "Book of the Law of Moses." This is a point of much importance, inasmuch as the critics deny that there is any such reference; and hence they deny the historical character of the Pentateuch. As regards the Passover, e.g., we find it frequently spoken of or alluded to in the historical books following the Pentateuch, showing that the "Law of Moses" was then certainly known. It was celebrated in the time of Joshua (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 5:10, cf. 4:19</reflink>), Hezekiah (2 Chr. 30), Josiah (2 Kings 23; 2 Chr. 35), and Zerubbabel (<reflink target="XXX">Ezra 6:19-22</reflink>), and is referred to in such passages as 2 Kings 23:22; 2 Chr. 35:18; 1 Kings 9:25 ("three times in a year"); 2 Chr. 8:13. Similarly we might show frequent references to the Feast of Tabernacles and other Jewish institutions, although we do not admit that any valid argument can be drawn from the silence of Scripture in such a case. An examination of the following texts, 1 Kings 2:9; 2 Kings 14:6; 2 Chr. 23:18; 25:4; 34:14; Ezra 3:2; 7:6; Dan. 9:11, 13, will also plainly show that the "Law of Moses" was known during all these centuries.</description>
    <description>Granting that in the time of Moses there existed certain oral traditions or written records and documents which he was divinely led to make use of in his history, and that his writing was revised by inspired successors, this will fully account for certain peculiarities of expression which critics have called "anachronisms" and "contradictions," but in no way militates against the doctrine that Moses was the original author of the whole of the Pentateuch. It is not necessary for us to affirm that the whole is an original composition; but we affirm that the evidences clearly demonstrate that Moses was the author of those books which have come down to us bearing his name. The Pentateuch is certainly the basis and necessary preliminary of the whole of the Old Testament history and literature. (<see target="x-self">See DEUTERONOMY.</see>)</description>

From the sixteenth of the month of Nisan (the second day of the Passover), seven complete weeks, i.e., forty-nine days, were to be reckoned, and this feast was held on the fiftieth day. The manner in which it was to be kept is described in Lev. 23:15-19; Num. 28:27-29. Besides the sacrifices prescribed for the occasion, every one was to bring to the Lord his "tribute of a free-will offering" (<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 16:9-11</reflink>). The purpose of this feast was to commemorate the completion of the grain harvest. Its distinguishing feature was the offering of "two leavened loaves" made from the new corn of the completed harvest, which, with two lambs, were waved before the Lord as a thank offering.</description>

    <description>The first great persecution for religious opinion of which we have any record was that which broke out against the worshippers of God among the Jews in the days of Ahab, when that king, at the instigation of his wife Jezebel, "a woman in whom, with the reckless and licentious habits of an Oriental queen, were united the fiercest and sternest qualities inherent in the old Semitic race", sought in the most relentless manner to extirpate the worship of Jehovah and substitute in its place the worship of Ashtoreth and Baal. Ahab's example in this respect was followed by Manasseh, who "shed innocent blood very much, till he had filled Jerusalem from one end to another" (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 21:16; comp. 24:4</reflink>). In all ages, in one form or another, the people of God have had to suffer persecution. In its earliest history the Christian church passed through many bloody persecutions. Of subsequent centuries in our own and in other lands the same sad record may be made.</description>
    <description>Christians are forbidden to seek the propagation of the gospel by force (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 7:1; Luke 9:54-56; Rom. 14:4; James 4:11, 12</reflink>). The words of Ps. 7:13, "He ordaineth his arrows against the persecutors," ought rather to be, as in the Revised Version, "He maketh his arrows fiery [shafts]."</description>

    <description>their certain continuance in a state of grace. Once justified and regenerated, the believer can neither totally nor finally fall away from grace, but will certainly persevere therein and attain everlasting life.</description>
    <description>This doctrine is clearly taught in these passages, John 10:28, 29; Rom. 11:29; Phil. 1:6; 1 Pet. 1:5. It, moreover, follows from a consideration of (1) the immutability of the divine decrees (<reflink target="XXX">Jer. 31:3; Matt. 24:22-24; Acts 13:48; Rom. 8:30</reflink>); (2) the provisions of the covenant of grace (<reflink target="XXX">Jer. 32:40; John 10:29; 17:2-6</reflink>); (3) the atonement and intercession of Christ (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 53:6, 11; Matt. 20:28; 1 Pet. 2:24; John 11:42; 17:11, 15, 20; Rom. 8:34</reflink>); and (4) the indwelling of the Holy Ghost (<reflink target="XXX">John 14:16; 2 Cor. 1:21, 22; 5:5; Eph. 1:14; 1 John 3:9</reflink>).</description>
    <description>This doctrine is not inconsistent with the truth that the believer may nevertheless fall into grievous sin, and continue therein for some time. (<see target="x-self">See BACKSLIDE.</see>)</description>

  <item id="Persia">
    <description>an ancient empire, extending from the Indus to Thrace, and from the Caspian Sea to the Red Sea and the Persian Gulf. The Persians were originally a Medic tribe which settled in Persia, on the eastern side of the Persian Gulf. They were Aryans, their language belonging to the eastern division of the Indo-European group. One of their chiefs, Teispes, conquered Elam in the time of the decay of the Assyrian Empire, and established himself in the district of Anzan. His descendants branched off into two lines, one line ruling in Anzan, while the other remained in Persia. Cyrus II., king of Anzan, finally united the divided power, conquered Media, Lydia, and Babylonia, and carried his arms into the far East. His son, Cambyses, added Egypt to the empire, which, however, fell to pieces after his death. It was reconquered and thoroughly organized by Darius, the son of Hystaspes, whose dominions extended from India to the Danube.</description>

  <item id="Peter">
    <description>originally called Simon (=Simeon ,i.e., "hearing"), a very common Jewish name in the New Testament. He was the son of Jona (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 16:17</reflink>). His mother is nowhere named in Scripture. He had a younger brother called Andrew, who first brought him to Jesus (<reflink target="XXX">John 1:40-42</reflink>). His native town was Bethsaida, on the western coast of the Sea of Galilee, to which also Philip belonged. Here he was brought up by the shores of the Sea of Galilee, and was trained to the occupation of a fisher. His father had probably died while he was still young, and he and his brother were brought up under the care of Zebedee and his wife Salome (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 27:56; Mark 15:40; 16:1</reflink>). There the four youths, Simon, Andrew, James, and John, spent their boyhood and early manhood in constant fellowship. Simon and his brother doubtless enjoyed all the advantages of a religious training, and were early instructed in an acquaintance with the Scriptures and with the great prophecies regarding the coming of the Messiah. They did not probably enjoy, however, any special training in the study of the law under any of the rabbis. When Peter appeared before the Sanhedrin, he looked like an "unlearned man" (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 4:13</reflink>).</description>
    <description>"Simon was a Galilean, and he was that out and out...The Galileans had a marked character of their own. They had a reputation for an independence and energy which often ran out into turbulence. They were at the same time of a franker and more transparent disposition than their brethren in the south. In all these respects, in bluntness, impetuosity, headiness, and simplicity, Simon was a genuine Galilean. They spoke a peculiar dialect. They had a difficulty with the guttural sounds and some others, and their pronunciation was reckoned harsh in Judea. The Galilean accent stuck to Simon all through his career. It betrayed him as a follower of Christ when he stood within the judgment-hall (<reflink target="XXX">Mark 14:70</reflink>). It betrayed his own nationality and that of those conjoined with him on the day of Pentecost (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 2:7</reflink>)." It would seem that Simon was married before he became an apostle. His wife's mother is referred to (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 8:14; Mark 1:30; Luke 4:38</reflink>). He was in all probability accompanied by his wife on his missionary journeys (<reflink target="XXX">1 Cor. 9:5; comp. 1 Pet. 5:13</reflink>).</description>
    <description>He appears to have been settled at Capernaum when Christ entered on his public ministry, and may have reached beyond the age of thirty. His house was large enough to give a home to his brother Andrew, his wife's mother, and also to Christ, who seems to have lived with him (<reflink target="XXX">Mark 1:29, 36; 2:1</reflink>), as well as to his own family. It was apparently two stories high (2:4).</description>
    <description>At Bethabara (R.V., John 1:28, "Bethany"), beyond Jordan, John the Baptist had borne testimony concerning Jesus as the "Lamb of God" (<reflink target="XXX">John 1:29-36</reflink>). Andrew and John hearing it, followed Jesus, and abode with him where he was. They were convinced, by his gracious words and by the authority with which he spoke, that he was the Messiah (<reflink target="XXX">Luke 4:22; Matt. 7:29</reflink>); and Andrew went forth and found Simon and brought him to Jesus (<reflink target="XXX">John 1:41</reflink>).</description>
    <description>Jesus at once recognized Simon, and declared that hereafter he would be called Cephas, an Aramaic name corresponding to the Greek Petros, which means "a mass of rock detached from the living rock." The Aramaic name does not occur again, but the name Peter gradually displaces the old name Simon, though our Lord himself always uses the name Simon when addressing him (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 17:25; Mark 14:37; Luke 22:31, comp. 21:15-17</reflink>). We are not told what impression the first interview with Jesus produced on the mind of Simon. When we next meet him it is by the Sea of Galilee (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 4:18-22</reflink>). There the four (Simon and Andrew, James and John) had had an unsuccessful night's fishing. Jesus appeared suddenly, and entering into Simon's boat, bade him launch forth and let down the nets. He did so, and enclosed a great multitude of fishes. This was plainly a miracle wrought before Simon's eyes. The awe-stricken disciple cast himself at the feet of Jesus, crying, "Depart from me; for I am a sinful man, O Lord" (<reflink target="XXX">Luke 5:8</reflink>). Jesus addressed him with the assuring words, "Fear not," and announced to him his life's work. Simon responded at once to the call to become a disciple, and after this we find him in constant attendance on our Lord.</description>
    <description>He is next called into the rank of the apostleship, and becomes a "fisher of men" (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 4:19</reflink>) in the stormy seas of the world of human life (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 10:2-4; Mark 3:13-19; Luke 6:13-16</reflink>), and takes a more and more prominent part in all the leading events of our Lord's life. It is he who utters that notable profession of faith at Capernaum (<reflink target="XXX">John 6:66-69</reflink>), and again at Caesarea Philippi (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 16:13-20; Mark 8:27-30; Luke 9:18-20</reflink>). This profession at Caesarea was one of supreme importance, and our Lord in response used these memorable words: "Thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church."</description>
    <description>"From that time forth" Jesus began to speak of his sufferings. For this Peter rebuked him. But our Lord in return rebuked Peter, speaking to him in sterner words than he ever used to any other of his disciples (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 16:21-23; Mark 8:31-33</reflink>). At the close of his brief sojourn at Caesarea our Lord took Peter and James and John with him into "an high mountain apart," and was transfigured before them. Peter on that occasion, under the impression the scene produced on his mind, exclaimed, "Lord, it is good for us to be here: let us make three tabernacles" (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 17:1-9</reflink>).</description>
    <description>On his return to Capernaum the collectors of the temple tax (a didrachma, half a sacred shekel), which every Israelite of twenty years old and upwards had to pay (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 30:15</reflink>), came to Peter and reminded him that Jesus had not paid it (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 17:24-27</reflink>). Our Lord instructed Peter to go and catch a fish in the lake and take from its mouth the exact amount needed for the tax, viz., a stater, or two half-shekels. "That take," said our Lord, "and give unto them for me and thee."</description>
    <description>As the end was drawing nigh, our Lord sent Peter and John (<reflink target="XXX">Luke 22:7-13</reflink>) into the city to prepare a place where he should keep the feast with his disciples. There he was forewarned of the fearful sin into which he afterwards fell (22:31-34). He accompanied our Lord from the guest-chamber to the garden of Gethsemane (<reflink target="XXX">Luke 22:39-46</reflink>), which he and the other two who had been witnesses of the transfiguration were permitted to enter with our Lord, while the rest were left without. Here he passed through a strange experience. Under a sudden impulse he cut off the ear of Malchus (47-51), one of the band that had come forth to take Jesus. Then follow the scenes of the judgment-hall (54-61) and his bitter grief (62).</description>
    <description>He is found in John's company early on the morning of the resurrection. He boldly entered into the empty grave (<reflink target="XXX">John 20:1-10</reflink>), and saw the "linen clothes laid by themselves" (<reflink target="XXX">Luke 24:9-12</reflink>). To him, the first of the apostles, our risen Lord revealed himself, thus conferring on him a signal honour, and showing how fully he was restored to his favour (<reflink target="XXX">Luke 24:34; 1 Cor. 15:5</reflink>). We next read of our Lord's singular interview with Peter on the shores of the Sea of Galilee, where he thrice asked him, "Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me?" (<reflink target="XXX">John 21:1-19</reflink>). (<see target="x-self">See LOVE.</see>)</description>
    <description>After this scene at the lake we hear nothing of Peter till he again appears with the others at the ascension (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 1:15-26</reflink>). It was he who proposed that the vacancy caused by the apostasy of Judas should be filled up. He is prominent on the day of Pentecost (2:14-40). The events of that day "completed the change in Peter himself which the painful discipline of his fall and all the lengthened process of previous training had been slowly making. He is now no more the unreliable, changeful, self-confident man, ever swaying between rash courage and weak timidity, but the stead-fast, trusted guide and director of the fellowship of believers, the intrepid preacher of Christ in Jerusalem and abroad. And now that he is become Cephas indeed, we hear almost nothing of the name Simon (<reflink target="XXX">only in Acts 10:5, 32; 15:14</reflink>), and he is known to us finally as Peter."</description>
    <description>After the miracle at the temple gate (Acts 3) persecution arose against the Christians, and Peter was cast into prison. He boldly defended himself and his companions at the bar of the council (4:19, 20). A fresh outburst of violence against the Christians (5:17-21) led to the whole body of the apostles being cast into prison; but during the night they were wonderfully delivered, and were found in the morning teaching in the temple. A second time Peter defended them before the council (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 5:29-32</reflink>), who, "when they had called the apostles and beaten them, let them go."</description>
    <description>The time had come for Peter to leave Jerusalem. After labouring for some time in Samaria, he returned to Jerusalem, and reported to the church there the results of his work (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 8:14-25</reflink>). Here he remained for a period, during which he met Paul for the first time since his conversion (9:26-30; Gal. 1:18). Leaving Jerusalem again, he went forth on a missionary journey to Lydda and Joppa (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 9:32-43</reflink>). He is next called on to open the door of the Christian church to the Gentiles by the admission of Cornelius of Caesarea (ch. 10).</description>
    <description>After remaining for some time at Caesarea, he returned to Jerusalem (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 11:1-18</reflink>), where he defended his conduct with reference to the Gentiles. Next we hear of his being cast into prison by Herod Agrippa (12:1-19); but in the night an angel of the Lord opened the prison gates, and he went forth and found refuge in the house of Mary.</description>
    <description>He took part in the deliberations of the council in Jerusalem (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 15:1-31; Gal. 2:1-10</reflink>) regarding the relation of the Gentiles to the church. This subject had awakened new interest at Antioch, and for its settlement was referred to the council of the apostles and elders at Jerusalem. Here Paul and Peter met again.</description>
    <description>We have no further mention of Peter in the Acts of the Apostles. He seems to have gone down to Antioch after the council at Jerusalem, and there to have been guilty of dissembling, for which he was severely reprimanded by Paul (<reflink target="XXX">Gal. 2:11-16</reflink>), who "rebuked him to his face."</description>
    <description>After this he appears to have carried the gospel to the east, and to have laboured for a while at Babylon, on the Euphrates (<reflink target="XXX">1 Pet. 5:13</reflink>). There is no satisfactory evidence that he was ever at Rome. Where or when he died is not certainly known. Probably he died between A.D. 64 and 67.</description>

  <item id="Peter, First Epistle of">
    <description>This epistle is addressed to "the strangers scattered abroad", i.e., to the Jews of the Dispersion (the Diaspora).</description>
    <description>Its object is to confirm its readers in the doctrines they had been already taught. Peter has been called "the apostle of hope," because this epistle abounds with words of comfort and encouragement fitted to sustain a "lively hope." It contains about thirty-five references to the Old Testament.</description>
    <description>It was written from Babylon, on the Euphrates, which was at this time one of the chief seats of Jewish learning, and a fitting centre for labour among the Jews. It has been noticed that in the beginning of his epistle Peter names the provinces of Asia Minor in the order in which they would naturally occur to one writing from Babylon. He counsels (1) to steadfastness and perseverance under persecution (1-2:10); (2) to the practical duties of a holy life (2:11-3:13); (3) he adduces the example of Christ and other motives to patience and holiness (3:14-4:19); and (4) concludes with counsels to pastors and people (ch. 5).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Peter, Second Epistle of">
    <description>The question of the authenticity of this epistle has been much discussed, but the weight of evidence is wholly in favour of its claim to be the production of the apostle whose name it bears. It appears to have been written shortly before the apostle's death (1:14). This epistle contains eleven references to the Old Testament. It also contains (3:15, 16) a remarkable reference to Paul's epistles. Some think this reference is to 1 Thess. 4:13-5:11. A few years ago, among other documents, a parchment fragment, called the "Gospel of Peter," was discovered in a Christian tomb at Akhmim in Upper Egypt. Origen (obiit A.D. 254), Eusebius (obiit 340), and Jerome (obiit 420) refer to such a work, and hence it has been concluded that it was probably written about the middle of the second century. It professes to give a history of our Lord's resurrection and ascension. While differing in not a few particulars from the canonical Gospels, the writer shows plainly that he was acquinted both with the synoptics and with the Gospel of John. Though apocryphal, it is of considerable value as showing that the main facts of the history of our Lord were then widely known.</description>

    <description>the official title borne by the Egyptian kings down to the time when that country was conquered by the Greeks. (See EGYPT</description>
    <description>(1.) The Pharaoh who was on the throne when Abram went down into Egypt (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 12:10-20</reflink>) was probably one of the Hyksos, or "shepherd kings." The Egyptians called the nomad tribes of Syria Shasu, "plunderers," their king or chief Hyk, and hence the name of those invaders who conquered the native kings and established a strong government, with Zoan or Tanis as their capital. They were of Semitic origin, and of kindred blood accordingly with Abram. They were probably driven forward by the pressure of the Hittites. The name they bear on the monuments is "Mentiu."</description>
    <description>(2.) The Pharaoh of Joseph's days (Gen. 41) was probably Apopi, or Apopis, the last of the Hyksos kings. To the old native Egyptians, who were an African race, shepherds were "an abomination;" but to the Hyksos kings these Asiatic shepherds who now appeared with Jacob at their head were congenial, and being akin to their own race, had a warm welcome (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 47:5, 6</reflink>). Some argue that Joseph came to Egypt in the reign of Thothmes III., long after the expulsion of the Hyksos, and that his influence is to be seen in the rise and progress of the religious revolution in the direction of monotheism which characterized the middle of the Eighteenth Dynasty. The wife of Amenophis III., of that dynasty, was a Semite. Is this singular fact to be explained from the presence of some of Joseph's kindred at the Egyptian court? Pharaoh said to Joseph, "Thy father and thy brethren are come unto thee: the land of Egypt is before thee; in the best of the land make thy father and brethren to dwell" (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 47:5, 6</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(3.) The "new king who knew not Joseph" (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 1:8-22</reflink>) has been generally supposed to have been Aahmes I., or Amosis, as he is called by Josephus. Recent discoveries, however, have led to the conclusion that Seti was the "new king."</description>
    <description>For about seventy years the Hebrews in Egypt were under the powerful protection of Joseph. After his death their condition was probably very slowly and gradually changed. The invaders, the Hyksos, who for some five centuries had been masters of Egypt, were driven out, and the old dynasty restored. The Israelites now began to be looked down upon. They began to be afflicted and tyrannized over. In process of time a change appears to have taken place in the government of Egypt. A new dynasty, the Nineteenth, as it is called, came into power under Seti I., who was its founder. He associated with him in his government his son, Rameses II., when he was yet young, probably ten or twelve years of age.</description>
    <description>Note, Professor Maspero, keeper of the museum of Bulak, near Cairo, had his attention in 1870 directed to the fact that scarabs, i.e., stone and metal imitations of the beetle (symbols of immortality), originally worn as amulets by royal personages, which were evidently genuine relics of the time of the ancient Pharaohs, were being sold at Thebes and different places along the Nile. This led him to suspect that some hitherto undiscovered burial-place of the Pharaohs had been opened, and that these and other relics, now secretly sold, were a part of the treasure found there. For a long time he failed, with all his ingenuity, to find the source of these rare treasures. At length one of those in the secret volunteered to give information regarding this burial-place. The result was that a party was conducted in 1881 to Dier el-Bahari, near Thebes, when the wonderful discovery was made of thirty-six mummies of kings, queens, princes, and high priests hidden away in a cavern prepared for them, where they had lain undisturbed for thirty centuries. "The temple of Deir el-Bahari stands in the middle of a natural amphitheatre of cliffs, which is only one of a number of smaller amphitheatres into which the limestone mountains of the tombs are broken up. In the wall of rock separating this basin from the one next to it some ancient Egyptian engineers had constructed the hiding-place, whose secret had been kept for nearly three thousand years." The exploring party being guided to the place, found behind a great rock a shaft 6 feet square and about 40 feet deep, sunk into the limestone. At the bottom of this a passage led westward for 25 feet, and then turned sharply northward into the very heart of the mountain, where in a chamber 23 feet by 13, and 6 feet in height, they came upon the wonderful treasures of antiquity. The mummies were all carefully secured and brought down to Bulak, where they were deposited in the royal museum, which has now been removed to Ghizeh.</description>
    <description>Among the most notable of the ancient kings of Egypt thus discovered were Thothmes III., Seti I., and Rameses II. Thothmes III. was the most distinguished monarch of the brilliant Eighteenth Dynasty. When this mummy was unwound "once more, after an interval of thirty-six centuries, human eyes gazed on the features of the man who had conquered Syria and Cyprus and Ethiopia, and had raised Egypt to the highest pinnacle of her power. The spectacle, however, was of brief duration. The remains proved to be in so fragile a state that there was only time to take a hasty photograph, and then the features crumbled to pieces and vanished like an apparition, and so passed away from human view for ever." "It seems strange that though the body of this man," who overran Palestine with his armies two hundred years before the birth of Moses, "mouldered to dust, the flowers with which it had been wreathed were so wonderfully preserved that even their colour could be distinguished" (Manning's Land of the Pharaohs).</description>
    <description>Seti I. (his throne name Merenptah), the father of Rameses II., was a great and successful warrior, also a great builder. The mummy of this Pharaoh, when unrolled, brought to view "the most beautiful mummy head ever seen within the walls of the museum. The sculptors of Thebes and Abydos did not flatter this Pharaoh when they gave him that delicate, sweet, and smiling profile which is the admiration of travellers. After a lapse of thirty-two centuries, the mummy retains the same expression which characterized the features of the living man. Most remarkable of all, when compared with the mummy of Rameses II., is the striking resemblance between the father and the son. Seti I. is, as it were, the idealized type of Rameses II. He must have died at an advanced age. The head is shaven, the eyebrows are white, the condition of the body points to considerably more than threescore years of life, thus confirming the opinions of the learned, who have attributed a long reign to this king."</description>
    <description>(4.) Rameses II., the son of Seti I., is probably the Pharaoh of the Oppression. During his forty years' residence at the court of Egypt, Moses must have known this ruler well. During his sojourn in Midian, however, Rameses died, after a reign of sixty-seven years, and his body embalmed and laid in the royal sepulchre in the Valley of the Tombs of Kings beside that of his father. Like the other mummies found hidden in the cave of Deir el-Bahari, it had been for some reason removed from its original tomb, and probably carried from place to place till finally deposited in the cave where it was so recently discovered.</description>
    <description>In 1886, the mummy of this king, the "great Rameses," the "Sesostris" of the Greeks, was unwound, and showed the body of what must have been a robust old man. The features revealed to view are thus described by Maspero: "The head is long and small in proportion to the body. The top of the skull is quite bare. On the temple there are a few sparse hairs, but at the poll the hair is quite thick, forming smooth, straight locks about two inches in length. White at the time of death, they have been dyed a light yellow by the spices used in embalmment. The forehead is low and narrow; the brow-ridge prominent; the eye-brows are thick and white; the eyes are small and close together; the nose is long, thin, arched like the noses of the Bourbons; the temples are sunk; the cheek-bones very prominent; the ears round, standing far out from the head, and pierced, like those of a woman, for the wearing of earrings; the jaw-bone is massive and strong; the chin very prominent; the mouth small, but thick-lipped; the teeth worn and very brittle, but white and well preserved. The moustache and beard are thin. They seem to have been kept shaven during life, but were probably allowed to grow during the king's last illness, or they may have grown after death. The hairs are white, like those of the head and eyebrows, but are harsh and bristly, and a tenth of an inch in length. The skin is of an earthy-brown, streaked with black. Finally, it may be said, the face of the mummy gives a fair idea of the face of the living king. The expression is unintellectual, perhaps slightly animal; but even under the somewhat grotesque disguise of mummification there is plainly to be seen an air of sovereign majesty, of resolve, and of pride."</description>
    <description>Both on his father's and his mother's side it has been pretty clearly shown that Rameses had Chaldean or Mesopotamian blood in his veins to such a degree that he might be called an Assyrian. This fact is thought to throw light on Isa. 52:4.</description>
    <description>(5.) The Pharaoh of the Exodus was probably Menephtah I., the fourteenth and eldest surviving son of Rameses II. He resided at Zoan, where he had the various interviews with Moses and Aaron recorded in the book of Exodus. His mummy was not among those found at Deir el-Bahari. It is still a question, however, whether Seti II. or his father Menephtah was the Pharaoh of the Exodus. Some think the balance of evidence to be in favour of the former, whose reign it is known began peacefully, but came to a sudden and disastrous end. The "Harris papyrus," found at Medinet-Abou in Upper Egypt in 1856, a state document written by Rameses III., the second king of the Twentieth Dynasty, gives at length an account of a great exodus from Egypt, followed by wide-spread confusion and anarchy. This, there is great reason to believe, was the Hebrew exodus, with which the Nineteenth Dynasty of the Pharaohs came to an end. This period of anarchy was brought to a close by Setnekht, the founder of the Twentieth Dynasty.</description>
    <description>"In the spring of 1896, Professor Flinders Petrie discovered, among the ruins of the temple of Menephtah at Thebes, a large granite stela, on which is engraved a hymn of victory commemorating the defeat of Libyan invaders who had overrun the Delta. At the end other victories of Menephtah are glanced at, and it is said that 'the Israelites (I-s-y-r-a-e-l-u) are minished (?) so that they have no seed.' Menephtah was son and successor of Rameses II., the builder of Pithom, and Egyptian scholars have long seen in him the Pharaoh of the Exodus. The Exodus is also placed in his reign by the Egyptian legend of the event preserved by the historian Manetho. In the inscription the name of the Israelites has no determinative of 'country' or 'district' attached to it, as is the case with all the other names (Canaan, Ashkelon, Gezer, Khar or Southern Palestine, etc.) mentioned along with it, and it would therefore appear that at the time the hymn was composed, the Israelites had already been lost to the sight of the Egyptians in the desert. At all events they must have had as yet no fixed home or district of their own. We may therefore see in the reference to them the Pharaoh's version of the Exodus, the disasters which befell the Egyptians being naturally passed over in silence, and only the destruction of the 'men children' of the Israelites being recorded. The statement of the Egyptian poet is a remarkable parallel to Ex. 1:10-22."</description>

She was in all probability the sister of Rameses, and the daughter of Seti I. Josephus calls her Thermuthis. It is supposed by some that she was Nefert-ari, the wife as well as sister of Rameses.

They were probably the successors of the Assideans (i.e., the "pious"), a party that originated in the time of Antiochus Epiphanes in revolt against his heathenizing policy. The first mention of them is in a description by Josephus of the three sects or schools into which the Jews were divided (B.C. 145). The other two sects were the Essenes and the Sadducees. In the time of our Lord they were the popular party (<reflink target="XXX">John 7:48</reflink>). They were extremely accurate and minute in all matters appertaining to the law of Moses (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 9:14; 23:15; Luke 11:39; 18:12</reflink>).

  <item id="Phenicia">
    <description>(<reflink target="XXX">Acts 21:2</reflink>) = Phenice (11:19; 15:3; R.V., Phoenicia), Gr. phoinix, "a palm", the land of palm-trees; a strip of land of an average breadth of about 20 miles along the shores of the Mediterranean, from the river Eleutherus in the north to the promotory of Carmel in the south, about 120 miles in length. This name is not found in the Old Testament, and in the New Testament it is mentioned only in the passages above referred to.</description>
    <description>"In the Egyptian inscriptions Phoenicia is called Keft, the inhabitants being Kefa; and since Keft-ur, or 'Greater Phoenicia,' was the name given to the delta of the Nile from the Phoenician colonies settled upon it, the Philistines who came from Caphtor or Keft-ur must have been of Phoenician origin" (<reflink target="XXX">comp. Deut. 2:23; Jer. 47:4; Amos 9:7</reflink>)., Sayce's Bible and the Monuments.</description>
    <description>Phoenicia lay in the very centre of the old world, and was the natural entrepot for commerce with foreign nations. It was the "England of antiquity." "The trade routes from all Asia converged on the Phoenician coast; the centres of commerce on the Euphrates and Tigris forwarding their goods by way of Tyre to the Nile, to Arabia, and to the west; and, on the other hand, the productions of the vast regions bordering the Mediterranean passing through the Canaanite capital to the eastern world." It was "situate at the entry of the sea, a merchant of the people for many isles" (<reflink target="XXX">Ezek. 27:3, 4</reflink>). The far-reaching commercial activity of the Phoenicians, especially with Tarshish and the western world, enriched them with vast wealth, which introduced boundless luxury and developed among them a great activity in all manner of arts and manufactures. (<see target="x-self">See TYRE.</see>)</description>
    <description>The Phoenicians were the most enterprising merchants of the old world, establishing colonies at various places, of which Carthage was the chief. They were a Canaanite branch of the race of Ham, and are frequently called Sidonians, from their principal city of Sidon. None could "skill to hew timber like unto the Sidonians" (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 5:6</reflink>). King Hiram rendered important service to Solomon in connection with the planning and building of the temple, casting for him all the vessels for the temple service, and the two pillars which stood in the front of the porch, and "the molten sea" (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 7:21-23</reflink>). Singular marks have been found by recent exploration on the great stones that form the substructure of the temple. These marks, both painted and engraved, have been regarded as made by the workmen in the quarries, and as probably intended to indicate the place of these stones in the building. "The Biblical account (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 5:17, 18</reflink>) is accurately descriptive of the massive masonry now existing at the south-eastern angle (of the temple area), and standing on the native rock 80 feet below the present surface. The Royal Engineers found, buried deeply among the rubbish of many centuries, great stones, costly and hewed stones, forming the foundation of the sanctuary wall; while Phoenician fragments of pottery and Phoenician marks painted on the massive blocks seem to proclaim that the stones were prepared in the quarry by the cunning workmen of Hiram, the king of Tyre." (See TEMPLE</description>
    <description>The Phoenicians have been usually regarded as the inventors of alphabetic writing. The Egyptians expressed their thoughts by certain symbols, called "hieroglyphics", i.e., sacred carvings, so styled because used almost exclusively on sacred subjects. The recent discovery, however, of inscriptions in Southern Arabia (Yemen and Hadramaut), known as Hemyaritic, in connection with various philogical considerations, has led some to the conclusion that the Phoenician alphabet was derived from the Mineans (admitting the antiquity of the kingdom of Ma'in, Judg. 10:12; 2 Chr. 26:7). Thus the Phoenician alphabet ceases to be the mother alphabet. Sayce thinks "it is more than possible that the Egyptians themselves were emigrants from Southern Arabia." (<see target="x-self">See MOABITE STONE.</see>)</description>
    <description>"The Phoenicians were renowned in ancient times for the manufacture of glass, and some of the specimens of this work that have been preserved are still the wonder of mankind...In the matter of shipping, whether ship-building be thought of or traffic upon the sea, the Phoenicians surpassed all other nations." "The name Phoenicia is of uncertain origin, though it may be derived from Fenkhu, the name given in the Egyptian inscriptions to the natives of Palestine. Among the chief Phoenician cities were Tyre and Sidon, Gebal north of Beirut, Arvad or Arados and Zemar."</description>

    <description>This epistle has the character of a strictly private letter, and is the only one of such epistles preserved to us. "It exhibits the apostle in a new light. He throws off as far as possible his apostolic dignity and his fatherly authority over his converts. He speaks simply as Christian to Christian. He speaks, therefore, with that peculiar grace of humility and courtesy which has, under the reign of Christianity, developed the spirit of chivalry and what is called 'the character of a gentleman,' certainly very little known in the old Greek and Roman civilization" (Dr. Barry).

  <item id="Philip">
    <description>lover of horses. (1.) One of the twelve apostles; a native of Bethsaida, "the city of Andrew and Peter" (<reflink target="XXX">John 1:44</reflink>). He readily responded to the call of Jesus when first addressed to him (43), and forthwith brought Nathanael also to Jesus (45,46). He seems to have held a prominent place among the apostles (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 10:3; Mark 3:18; John 6:5-7; 12:21, 22; 14:8, 9; Acts 1:13</reflink>). Of his later life nothing is certainly known. He is said to have preached in Phrygia, and to have met his death at Hierapolis.</description>
    <description>(2.) One of the "seven" (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 6:5</reflink>), called also "the evangelist" (21:8, 9). He was one of those who were "scattered abroad" by the persecution that arose on the death of Stephen. He went first to Samaria, where he laboured as an evangelist with much success (8:5-13). While he was there he received a divine command to proceed toward the south, along the road leading from Jerusalem to Gaza. These towns were connected by two roads. The one Philip was directed to take was that which led through Hebron, and thence through a district little inhabited, and hence called "desert." As he travelled along this road he was overtaken by a chariot in which sat a man of Ethiopia, the eunuch or chief officer of Queen Candace, who was at that moment reading, probably from the Septuagint version, a portion of the prophecies of Isaiah (53:6,7). Philip entered into conversation with him, and expounded these verses, preaching to him the glad tidings of the Saviour. The eunuch received the message and believed, and was forthwith baptized, and then "went on his way rejoicing." Philip was instantly caught away by the Spirit after the baptism, and the eunuch saw him no more. He was next found at Azotus, whence he went forth in his evangelistic work till he came to Caesarea. He is not mentioned again for about twenty years, when he is still found at Caesarea (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 21:8</reflink>) when Paul and his companions were on the way to Jerusalem. He then finally disappears from the page of history.</description>
    <description>(3.) Mentioned only in connection with the imprisonment of John the Baptist (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 14:3; Mark 6:17; Luke 3:19</reflink>).

    <description>(4.) The "tetrarch of Ituraea" (<reflink target="XXX">Luke 3:1</reflink>); a son of Herod the Great, and brother of Herod Antipas.

  <item id="Philippi">
    <description>(1.) Formerly Crenides, "the fountain," the capital of the province of Macedonia. It stood near the head of the Sea, about 8 miles north-west of Kavalla. It is now a ruined village, called Philibedjik. Philip of Macedonia fortified the old Thracian town of Crenides, and called it after his own name Philippi (B.C. 359-336). In the time of the Emperor Augustus this city became a Roman colony, i.e., a military settlement of Roman soldiers, there planted for the purpose of controlling the district recently conquered. It was a "miniature Rome," under the municipal law of Rome, and governed by military officers, called duumviri, who were appointed directly from Rome. Having been providentially guided thither, here Paul and his companion Silas preached the gospel and formed the first church in Europe. (<see target="x-self">See LYDIA.</see>) This success stirred up the enmity of the people, and they were "shamefully entreated" (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 16:9-40; 1 Thess. 2:2</reflink>). Paul and Silas at length left this city and proceeded to Amphipolis (q.v.).</description>
    <description>(2.) When Philip the tetrarch, the son of Herod, succeeded to the government of the northern portion of his kingdom, he enlarged the city of Paneas, and called it Caesarea, in honour of the emperor. But in order to distinguish it from the Caesarea on the sea coast, he added to it subsequently his own name, and called it Caesarea-Philippi (q.v.).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Philippians, Epistle to">
    <description>was written by Paul during the two years when he was "in bonds" in Rome (<reflink target="XXX">Phil. 1:7-13</reflink>), probably early in the year A.D. 62 or in the end of 61.</description>
    <description>The Philippians had sent Epaphroditus, their messenger, with contributions to meet the necessities of the apostle; and on his return Paul sent back with him this letter. With this precious communication Epaphroditus sets out on his homeward journey. "The joy caused by his return, and the effect of this wonderful letter when first read in the church of Philippi, are hidden from us. And we may almost say that with this letter the church itself passes from our view. To-day, in silent meadows, quiet cattle browse among the ruins which mark the site of what was once the flourishing Roman colony of Philippi, the home of the most attractive church of the apostolic age. But the name and fame and spiritual influence of that church will never pass. To myriads of men and women in every age and nation the letter written in a dungeon at Rome, and carried along the Egnatian Way by an obscure Christian messenger, has been a light divine and a cheerful guide along the most rugged paths of life" (Professor Beet).</description>
    <description>The church at Philippi was the first-fruits of European Christianity. Their attachment to the apostle was very fervent, and so also was his affection for them. They alone of all the churches helped him by their contributions, which he gratefully acknowledges (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 20:33-35; 2 Cor. 11:7-12; 2 Thess. 3:8</reflink>). The pecuniary liberality of the Philippians comes out very conspicuously (<reflink target="XXX">Phil. 4:15</reflink>). "This was a characteristic of the Macedonian missions, as 2 Cor. 8 and 9 amply and beautifully prove. It is remarkable that the Macedonian converts were, as a class, very poor (<reflink target="XXX">2 Cor. 8:2</reflink>); and the parallel facts, their poverty and their open-handed support of the great missionary and his work, are deeply harmonious. At the present day the missionary liberality of poor Christians is, in proportion, really greater than that of the rich" (Moule's Philippians, Introd.).</description>
    <description>The contents of this epistle give an interesting insight into the condition of the church at Rome at the time it was written. Paul's imprisonment, we are informed, was no hindrance to his preaching the gospel, but rather "turned out to the furtherance of the gospel." The gospel spread very extensively among the Roman soldiers, with whom he was in constant contact, and the Christians grew into a "vast multitude." It is plain that Christianity was at this time making rapid advancement in Rome.</description>
    <description>The doctrinal statements of this epistle bear a close relation to those of the Epistle to the Romans. Compare also Phil. 3:20 with Eph. 2:12, 19, where the church is presented under the idea of a city or commonwealth for the first time in Paul's writings. The personal glory of Christ is also set forth in almost parallel forms of expression in Phil. 2:5-11, compared with Eph. 1:17-23; 2:8; and Col. 1:15-20. "This exposition of the grace and wonder of His personal majesty, personal self-abasement, and personal exaltation after it," found in these epistles, "is, in a great measure, a new development in the revelations given through St. Paul" (Moule). Other minuter analogies in forms of expression and of thought are also found in these epistles of the Captivity.</description>

  <item id="Philistines">
    <description>(<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 10:14, R.V.; but in A.V., "Philistim"</reflink>), a tribe allied to the Phoenicians. They were a branch of the primitive race which spread over the whole district of the Lebanon and the valley of the Jordan, and Crete and other Mediterranean islands. Some suppose them to have been a branch of the Rephaim (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 21:16-22</reflink>). In the time of Abraham they inhabited the south-west of Judea, Abimelech of Gerar being their king (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 21:32, 34; 26:1</reflink>). They are, however, not noticed among the Canaanitish tribes mentioned in the Pentateuch. They are spoken of by Amos (9:7) and Jeremiah (47:4) as from Caphtor, i.e., probably Crete, or, as some think, the Delta of Egypt. In the whole record from Exodus to Samuel they are represented as inhabiting the tract of country which lay between Judea and Egypt (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 13:17; 15:14, 15; Josh. 13:3; 1 Sam. 4</reflink>).</description>
    <description>This powerful tribe made frequent incursions against the Hebrews. There was almost perpetual war between them. They sometimes held the tribes, especially the southern tribes, in degrading servitude (<reflink target="XXX">Judg. 15:11; 1 Sam. 13:19-22</reflink>); at other times they were defeated with great slaughter (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 14:1-47; 17</reflink>). These hostilities did not cease till the time of Hezekiah (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 18:8</reflink>), when they were entirely subdued. They still, however, occupied their territory, and always showed their old hatred to Israel (<reflink target="XXX">Ezek. 25:15-17</reflink>). They were finally conquered by the Romans.</description>
    <description>The Philistines are called Pulsata or Pulista on the Egyptian monuments; the land of the Philistines (Philistia) being termed Palastu and Pilista in the Assyrian inscriptions. They occupied the five cities of Gaza, Ashkelon, Ashdod, Ekron, and Gath, in the south-western corner of Canaan, which belonged to Egypt up to the closing days of the Nineteenth Dynasty. The occupation took place during the reign of Rameses III. of the Twentieth Dynasty. The Philistines had formed part of the great naval confederacy which attacked Egypt, but were eventually repulsed by that Pharaoh, who, however, could not dislodge them from their settlements in Palestine. As they did not enter Palestine till the time of the Exodus, the use of the name Philistines in Gen. 26:1 must be proleptic. Indeed the country was properly Gerar, as in ch. 20.</description>
    <description>They are called Allophyli, "foreigners," in the Septuagint, and in the Books of Samuel they are spoken of as uncircumcised. It would therefore appear that they were not of the Semitic race, though after their establishment in Canaan they adopted the Semitic language of the country. We learn from the Old Testament that they came from Caphtor, usually supposed to be Crete. From Philistia the name of the land of the Philistines came to be extended to the whole of "Palestine." Many scholars identify the Philistines with the Pelethites of 2 Sam. 8:18.</description>

For his faithfulness on that occasion he received the divine approbation (10-13). He afterwards commanded the army that went out against the Midianites (31:6-8). When representatives of the people were sent to expostulate with the two and a half tribes who, just after crossing Jordan, built an altar and departed without giving any explanation, Phinehas was their leader, and addressed them in the words recorded in Josh. 22:16-20. Their explanation follows. This great altar was intended to be all ages only a witness that they still formed a part of Israel. Phinehas was afterwards the chief adviser in the war with the Benjamites. He is commemorated in Ps. 106:30, 31. (See ED</description>

  <item id="Phylacteries">
    <description>(Gr. phulakteria; i.e., "defences" or "protections"), called by modern Jews tephillin (i.e., "prayers") are mentioned only in Matt. 23:5. They consisted of strips of parchment on which were inscribed these four texts: (1.) Ex. 13:1-10; (2.) 11-16; (3.) Deut. 6:4-9; (4.) 11:18-21, and which were enclosed in a square leather case, on one side of which was inscribed the Hebrew letter shin, to which the rabbis attached some significance. This case was fastened by certain straps to the forehead just between the eyes. The "making broad the phylacteries" refers to the enlarging of the case so as to make it conspicuous. (<see target="x-self">See FRONTLETS.</see>)</description>
    <description>Another form of the phylactery consisted of two rolls of parchment, on which the same texts were written, enclosed in a case of black calfskin. This was worn on the left arm near the elbow, to which it was bound by a thong. It was called the "Tephillah on the arm."</description>

  <item id="Physician">
    <description>Asa, afflicted with some bodily malady, "sought not to the Lord but to the physicians" (<reflink target="XXX">2 Chr. 16:12</reflink>). The "physicians" were those who "practised heathen arts of magic, disavowing recognized methods of cure, and dissociating the healing art from dependence on the God of Israel. The sin of Asa was not, therefore, in seeking medical advice, as we understand the phrase, but in forgetting Jehovah."</description>

  <item id="Pi-beseth">
    <description>(<reflink target="XXX">Ezek. 30:17</reflink>), supposed to mean. "a cat," or a deity in the form of a cat, worshipped by the Egyptians. It was called by the Greeks Bubastis. The hieroglyphic name is "Pe-bast", i.e., the house of Bast, the Artemis of the Egyptians. The town of Bubasts was situated on the Pelusian branch, i.e., the easternmost branch, of the Delta. It was the seat of one of the chief annual festivals of the Egyptians. Its ruins bear the modern name of Tel-Basta.</description>

  <item id="Pi-hahiroth">
    <description>place where the reeds grow (LXX. and Copt. read "farmstead"), the name of a place in Egypt where the children of Israel encamped (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 14:2, 9</reflink>), how long is uncertain. Some have identified it with Ajrud, a fortress between Etham and Suez. The condition of the Isthmus of Suez at the time of the Exodus is not exactly known, and hence this, with the other places mentioned as encampments of Israel in Egypt, cannot be definitely ascertained. The isthmus has been formed by the Nile deposits. This increase of deposit still goes on, and so rapidly that within the last fifty years the mouth of the Nile has advanced northward about four geographical miles. In the maps of Ptolemy (of the second and third centuries A.D.) the mouths of the Nile are forty miles further south than at present. (<see target="x-self">See EXODUS.</see>)</description>

  <item id="Pieces">
    <description>(1) of silver. In Ps. 68:30 denotes "fragments," and not properly money. In 1 Sam. 2:36 (Heb. agorah), properly a "small sum" as wages, weighed rather than coined. Josh. 24:32 (Heb. kesitah, q.v.), supposed by some to have been a piece of money bearing the figure of a lamb, but rather simply a certain amount. (<reflink target="XXX">Comp. Gen. 33:19</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(2.) The word pieces is omitted in many passages, as Gen. 20:16; 37:28; 45:22, etc. The passage in Zech. 11:12, 13 is quoted in the Gospel (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 26:15</reflink>), and from this we know that the word to be supplied is "shekels." In all these omissions we may thus warrantably supply this word.</description>
    <description>(3.) The "piece of money" mentioned in Matt. 17:27 is a stater=a Hebrew shekel, or four Greek drachmae; and that in Luke 15:8, 9, Act 19:19, a Greek drachma=a denarius. (See PENNY</description>

  <item id="Pilate, Pontius">
    <description>probably connected with the Roman family of the Pontii, and called "Pilate" from the Latin pileatus, i.e., "wearing the pileus", which was the "cap or badge of a manumitted slave," as indicating that he was a "freedman," or the descendant of one. He was the sixth in the order of the Roman procurators of Judea (A.D. 26-36). His headquarters were at Caesarea, but he frequently went up to Jerusalem. His reign extended over the period of the ministry of John the Baptist and of Jesus Christ, in connection with whose trial his name comes into prominent notice. Pilate was a "typical Roman, not of the antique, simple stamp, but of the imperial period, a man not without some remains of the ancient Roman justice in his soul, yet pleasure-loving, imperious, and corrupt. He hated the Jews whom he ruled, and in times of irritation freely shed their blood. They returned his hatred with cordiality, and accused him of every crime, maladministration, cruelty, and robbery. He visited Jerusalem as seldom as possible; for, indeed, to one accustomed to the pleasures of Rome, with its theatres, baths, games, and gay society, Jerusalem, with its religiousness and ever-smouldering revolt, was a dreary residence. When he did visit it he stayed in the palace of Herod the Great, it being common for the officers sent by Rome into conquered countries to occupy the palaces of the displaced sovereigns."</description>
    <description>After his trial before the Sanhedrin, Jesus was brought to the Roman procurator, Pilate, who had come up to Jerusalem as usual to preserve order during the Passover, and was now residing, perhaps, in the castle of Antonia, or it may be in Herod's palace. Pilate came forth from his palace and met the deputation from the Sanhedrin, who, in answer to his inquiry as to the nature of the accusation they had to prefer against Jesus, accused him of being a "malefactor." Pilate was not satisfied with this, and they further accused him (1) of sedition, (2) preventing the payment of the tribute to Caesar, and (3) of assuming the title of king (<reflink target="XXX">Luke 23:2</reflink>). Pilate now withdrew with Jesus into the palace (<reflink target="XXX">John 18:33</reflink>) and examined him in private (37,38); and then going out to the deputation still standing before the gate, he declared that he could find no fault in Jesus (<reflink target="XXX">Luke 23:4</reflink>). This only aroused them to more furious clamour, and they cried that he excited the populace "throughout all Jewry, beginning from Galilee." When Pilate heard of Galilee, he sent the accused to Herod Antipas, who had jurisdiction over that province, thus hoping to escape the difficulty in which he found himself. But Herod, with his men of war, set Jesus at nought, and sent him back again to Pilate, clad in a purple robe of mockery (23:11, 12).</description>
    <description>Pilate now proposed that as he and Herod had found no fault in him, they should release Jesus; and anticipating that they would consent to this proposal, he ascended the judgment-seat as if ready to ratify the decision (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 27:19</reflink>). But at this moment his wife (Claudia Procula) sent a message to him imploring him to have nothing to do with the "just person." Pilate's feelings of perplexity and awe were deepened by this incident, while the crowd vehemently cried out, "Not this man, but Barabbas." Pilate answered, "What then shall I do with Jesus?" The fierce cry immediately followed. "Let him be crucified." Pilate, apparently vexed, and not knowning what to do, said, "Why, what evil hath he done?" but with yet fiercer fanaticism the crowd yelled out, "Away with him! crucify him, crucify him!" Pilate yielded, and sent Jesus away to be scourged. This scourging was usually inflicted by lictors; but as Pilate was only a procurator he had no lictor, and hence his soldiers inflicted this terrible punishment. This done, the soldiers began to deride the sufferer, and they threw around him a purple robe, probably some old cast-off robe of state (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 27:28; John 19:2</reflink>), and putting a reed in his right hand, and a crowd of thorns on his head, bowed the knee before him in mockery, and saluted him, saying, "Hail, King of the Jews!" They took also the reed and smote him with it on the head and face, and spat in his face, heaping upon him every indignity.</description>
    <description>Pilate then led forth Jesus from within the Praetorium (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 27:27</reflink>) before the people, wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe, saying, "Behold the man!" But the sight of Jesus, now scourged and crowned and bleeding, only stirred their hatred the more, and again they cried out, "Crucify him, crucify him!" and brought forth this additional charge against him, that he professed to be "the Son of God." Pilate heard this accusation with a superstitious awe, and taking him once more within the Praetorium, asked him, "Whence art thou?" Jesus gave him no answer. Pilate was irritated by his continued silence, and said, "Knowest thou not that I have power to crucify thee?" Jesus, with calm dignity, answered the Roman, "Thou couldest have no power at all against me, except it were given thee from above."</description>
    <description>After this Pilate seemed more resolved than ever to let Jesus go. The crowd perceiving this cried out, "If thou let this man go, thou art not Caesar's friend." This settled the matter. He was afraid of being accused to the emperor. Calling for water, he washed his hands in the sight of the people, saying, "I am innocent of the blood of this just person." The mob, again scorning his scruples, cried, "His blood be on us, and on our children." Pilate was stung to the heart by their insults, and putting forth Jesus before them, said, "Shall I crucify your King?" The fatal moment had now come. They madly exclaimed, "We have no king but Caesar;" and now Jesus is given up to them, and led away to be crucified.</description>
    <description>By the direction of Pilate an inscription was placed, according to the Roman custom, over the cross, stating the crime for which he was crucified. Having ascertained from the centurion that he was dead, he gave up the body to Joseph of Arimathea to be buried. Pilate's name now disappears from the Gospel history. References to him, however, are found in the Acts of the Apostles (3:13; 4:27; 13:28), and in 1 Tim. 6:13. In A.D. 36 the governor of Syria brought serious accusations against Pilate, and he was banished to Vienne in Gaul, where, according to tradition, he committed suicide.</description>

  <item id="Pillar">

  <item id="Pine tree">
    <description>Heb. tidhar, mentioned along with the fir-tree in Isa. 41:19; 60:13. This is probably the cypress; or it may be the stone-pine, which is common on the northern slopes of Lebanon. Some suppose that the elm, others that the oak, or holm, or ilex, is meant by the Hebrew word. In Neh. 8:15 the Revised Version has "wild olive" instead of "pine."

  <item id="Pinnacle">
    <description>a little wing, (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 4:5; Luke 4:9</reflink>). On the southern side of the temple court was a range of porches or cloisters forming three arcades. At the south-eastern corner the roof of this cloister was some 300 feet above the Kidron valley. The pinnacle, some parapet or wing-like projection, was above this roof, and hence at a great height, probably 350 feet or more above the valley.</description>

  <item id="Pipe">
    <description>(<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 10:5; 1 Kings 1:40; Isa. 5:12; 30:29</reflink>). The Hebrew word halil, so rendered, means "bored through," and is the name given to various kinds of wind instruments, as the fife, flute, Pan-pipes, etc. In Amos 6:5 this word is rendered "instrument of music." This instrument is mentioned also in the New Testament (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 11:17; 1 Cor. 14:7</reflink>). It is still used in Palestine, and is, as in ancient times, made of different materials, as reed, copper, bronze, etc.</description>

  <item id="Pithom">
    <description>Egyptian, Pa-Tum, "house of Tum," the sun-god, one of the "treasure" cities built for Pharaoh Rameses II. by the Israelites (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 1:11</reflink>). It was probably the Patumos of the Greek historian Herodotus. It has now been satisfactorily identified with Tell-el-Maskhuta, about 12 miles west of Ismailia, and 20 east of Tel-el-Kebir, on the southern bank of the present Suez Canal. Here have recently (1883) been discovered the ruins of supposed grain-chambers, and other evidences to show that this was a great "store city." Its immense ruin-heaps show that it was built of bricks, and partly also of bricks without straw. Succoth (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 12:37</reflink>) is supposed by some to be the secular name of this city, Pithom being its sacred name. This was the first halting-place of the Israelites in their exodus. It has been argued (Dr. Lansing) that these "store" cities "were residence cities, royal dwellings, such as the Pharaohs of old, the Kings of Israel, and our modern Khedives have ever loved to build, thus giving employment to the superabundant muscle of their enslaved peoples, and making a name for themselves."</description>

Painful afflictions or diseases, (<reflink target="XXX">Lev. 13:3, 5, 30; 1 Kings 8:37</reflink>), or severe calamity (<reflink target="XXX">Mark 5:29; Luke 7:21</reflink>), or the judgment of God, so called (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 9:14</reflink>). Plagues of Egypt were ten in number.</description>
    <description>(1.) The river Nile was turned into blood, and the fish died, and the river stank, so that the Egyptians loathed to drink of the river (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 7:14-25</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(2.) The plague of frogs (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 8:1-15</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(3.) The plague of lice (Heb. kinnim, properly gnats or mosquitoes; comp. Ps. 78:45; 105:31), "out of the dust of the land" (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 8:16-19</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(4.) The plague of flies (Heb. arob, rendered by the LXX. dog-fly), Ex. 8:21-24.</description>
    <description>(5.) The murrain (<reflink target="XXX">Ex.9:1-7</reflink>), or epidemic pestilence which carried off vast numbers of cattle in the field. Warning was given of its coming.</description>
    <description>(6.) The sixth plague, of "boils and blains," like the third, was sent without warning (<reflink target="XXX">Ex.9:8-12</reflink>). It is called (<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 28:27</reflink>) "the botch of Egypt," A.V.; but in R.V., "the boil of Egypt." "The magicians could not stand before Moses" because of it.</description>
    <description>(7.) The plague of hail, with fire and thunder (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 9:13-33</reflink>). Warning was given of its coming. (<reflink target="XXX">Comp. Ps. 18:13; 105:32, 33</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(8.) The plague of locusts, which covered the whole face of the earth, so that the land was darkened with them (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 10:12-15</reflink>). The Hebrew name of this insect, _arbeh_, points to the "multitudinous" character of this visitation. Warning was given before this plague came.</description>
    <description>(9.) After a short interval the plague of darkness succeeded that of the locusts; and it came without any special warning (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 10:21-29</reflink>). The darkness covered "all the land of Egypt" to such an extent that "they saw not one another." It did not, however, extend to the land of Goshen.</description>
    <description>(10.) The last and most fearful of these plagues was the death of the first-born of man and of beast (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 11:4, 5; 12:29,30</reflink>). The exact time of the visitation was announced, "about midnight", which would add to the horror of the infliction. Its extent also is specified, from the first-born of the king to the first-born of the humblest slave, and all the first-born of beasts. But from this plague the Hebrews were completely exempted. The Lord "put a difference" between them and the Egyptians. (<see target="x-self">See PASSOVER.</see>)</description>

  <item id="Plain">
    <description>(1.) Heb. 'abel (<reflink target="XXX">Judg. 11:33</reflink>), a "grassy plain" or "meadow." Instead of "plains of the vineyards," as in the Authorized Version, the Revised Version has "Abel-cheramim" (q.v.), comp. Judg. 11:22; 2 Chr. 16:4.</description>
    <description>(2.) Heb. 'elon (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 12:6; 13:18; 14:13; 18:1; Deut. 11:30; Judg. 9:6</reflink>), more correctly "oak," as in the Revised Version; margin, "terebinth."</description>
    <description>(3.) Heb. bik'ah (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 11:2; Neh. 6:2; Ezek. 3:23; Dan. 3:1</reflink>), properly a valley, as rendered in Isa. 40:4, a broad plain between mountains. In Amos 1:5 the margin of Authorized Version has "Bikathaven."</description>
    <description>(4.) Heb. kikar, "the circle," used only of the Ghor, or the low ground along the Jordan (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 13:10-12; 19:17, 25, 28, 29; Deut. 34:3; 2 Sam. 18:23; 1 Kings 7:46; 2 Chr. 4:17; Neh. 3:22; 12:28</reflink>), the floor of the valley through which it flows. This name is applied to the Jordan valley as far north as Succoth.</description>
    <description>(5.) Heb. mishor, "level ground," smooth, grassy table-land (<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 3:10; 4:43; Josh. 13:9, 16, 17, 21; 20:8; Jer. 48:21</reflink>), an expanse of rolling downs without rock or stone. In these passages, with the article prefixed, it denotes the plain in the tribe of Reuben. In 2 Chr. 26:10 the plain of Judah is meant. Jerusalem is called "the rock of the plain" in Jer. 21:13, because the hills on which it is built rise high above the plain.</description>
    <description>(6.) Heb. 'arabah, the valley from the Sea of Galilee southward to the Dead Sea (the "sea of the plain," 2 Kings 14:25; Deut. 1:1; 2:8), a distance of about 70 miles. It is called by the modern Arabs the Ghor. This Hebrew name is found in Authorized Version (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 18:18</reflink>), and is uniformly used in the Revised Version. Down through the centre of this plain is a ravine, from 200 to 300 yards wide, and from 50 to 100 feet deep, through which the Jordan flows in a winding course. This ravine is called the "lower plain."</description>
    <description>The name Arabah is also applied to the whole Jordan valley from Mount Hermon to the eastern branch of the Red Sea, a distance of about 200 miles, as well as to that portion of the valley which stretches from the Sea of Galilee to the same branch of the Red Sea, i.e., to the Gulf of Akabah about 100 miles in all.</description>
    <description>(7.) Heb. shephelah, "low ground," "low hill-land," rendered "vale" or "valley" in Authorized Version (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 9:1; 10:40; 11:2; 12:8; Judg. 1:9; 1 Kings 10:27</reflink>). In Authorized Version (<reflink target="XXX">1 Chr. 27:28; 2 Chr. 26:10</reflink>) it is also rendered "low country." In Jer. 17:26, Obad. 1:19, Zech. 7:7, "plain." The Revised Version renders it uniformly "low land." When it is preceded by the article, as in Deut. 1:7, Josh. 11:16; 15:33, Jer. 32:44; 33:13, Zech. 7:7, "the shephelah," it denotes the plain along the Mediterranean from Joppa to Gaza, "the plain of the Philistines."

  <item id="Poetry">
    <description>has been well defined as "the measured language of emotion." Hebrew poetry deals almost exclusively with the great question of man's relation to God. "Guilt, condemnation, punishment, pardon, redemption, repentance are the awful themes of this heaven-born poetry."</description>
    <description>In the Hebrew scriptures there are found three distinct kinds of poetry, (1) that of the Book of Job and the Song of Solomon, which is dramatic; (2) that of the Book of Psalms, which is lyrical; and (3) that of the Book of Ecclesiastes, which is didactic and sententious.</description>
    <description>Hebrew poetry has nothing akin to that of Western nations. It has neither metre nor rhyme. Its great peculiarity consists in the mutual correspondence of sentences or clauses, called parallelism, or "thought-rhyme." Various kinds of this parallelism have been pointed out:</description>
    <description>(1.) Synonymous or cognate parallelism, where the same idea is repeated in the same words (<reflink target="XXX">Ps. 93:3; 94:1; Prov. 6:2</reflink>), or in different words (Ps. 22, 23, 28, 114, etc.); or where it is expressed in a positive form in the one clause and in a negative in the other (<reflink target="XXX">Ps. 40:12; Prov. 6:26</reflink>); or where the same idea is expressed in three successive clauses (<reflink target="XXX">Ps. 40:15, 16</reflink>); or in a double parallelism, the first and second clauses corresponding to the third and fourth (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 9:1; 61:10, 11</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(2.) Antithetic parallelism, where the idea of the second clause is the converse of that of the first (<reflink target="XXX">Ps. 20:8; 27:6, 7; 34:11; 37:9, 17, 21, 22</reflink>). This is the common form of gnomic or proverbial poetry. (<see target="x-self">See Prov. 10-15.</see>)</description>
    <description>(3.) Synthetic or constructive or compound parallelism, where each clause or sentence contains some accessory idea enforcing the main idea (<reflink target="XXX">Ps. 19:7-10; 85:12; Job 3:3-9; Isa. 1:5-9</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(4.) Introverted parallelism, in which of four clauses the first answers to the fourth and the second to the third (<reflink target="XXX">Ps. 135:15-18; Prov. 23:15, 16</reflink>), or where the second line reverses the order of words in the first (<reflink target="XXX">Ps. 86:2</reflink>).</description>
    <description>Hebrew poetry sometimes assumes other forms than these. (1.) An alphabetical arrangement is sometimes adopted for the purpose of connecting clauses or sentences. Thus in the following the initial words of the respective verses begin with the letters of the alphabet in regular succession: Prov. 31:10-31; Lam. 1, 2, 3, 4; Ps. 25, 34, 37, 145. Ps. 119 has a letter of the alphabet in regular order beginning every eighth verse.</description>
    <description>(2.) The repetition of the same verse or of some emphatic expression at intervals (Ps. 42, 107, where the refrain is in verses, 8, 15, 21, 31). (<reflink target="XXX">Comp. also Isa. 9:8-10:4; Amos 1:3, 6, 9, 11, 13; 2:1, 4, 6.</reflink>)</description>
    <description>(3.) Gradation, in which the thought of one verse is resumed in another (Ps. 121).</description>
    <description>Several odes of great poetical beauty are found in the historical books of the Old Testament, such as the song of Moses (Ex. 15), the song of Deborah (Judg. 5), of Hannah (1 Sam. 2), of Hezekiah (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 38:9-20</reflink>), of Habakkuk (Hab. 3), and David's "song of the bow" (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 1:19-27</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Poison">
    <description>(1.) Heb. hemah, "heat," the poison of certain venomous reptiles (<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 32:24, 33; Job 6:4; Ps. 58:4</reflink>), causing inflammation.</description>
    <description>(2.) Heb. rosh, "a head," a poisonous plant (<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 29:18</reflink>), growing luxuriantly (<reflink target="XXX">Hos. 10:4</reflink>), of a bitter taste (<reflink target="XXX">Ps. 69:21; Lam. 3:5</reflink>), and coupled with wormwood; probably the poppy. This word is rendered "gall", q.v., (<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 29:18; 32:33; Ps. 69:21; Jer. 8:14, etc.</reflink>), "hemlock" (<reflink target="XXX">Hos. 10:4; Amos 6:12</reflink>), and "poison" (<reflink target="XXX">Job 20:16</reflink>), "the poison of asps," showing that the _rosh_ was not exclusively a vegetable poison.</description>
    <description>(3.) In Rom. 3:13 (<reflink target="XXX">comp. Job 20:16; Ps. 140:3</reflink>), James 3:8, as the rendering of the Greek ios.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Pomegranate">
    <description>i.e., "grained apple" (pomum granatum), Heb. rimmon. Common in Egypt (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 20:5</reflink>) and Palestine (13:23; Deut. 8:8). The Romans called it Punicum malum, i.e., Carthaginian apple, because they received it from Carthage. It belongs to the myrtle family of trees. The withering of the pomegranate tree is mentioned among the judgments of God (<reflink target="XXX">Joel 1:12</reflink>). It is frequently mentioned in the Song of Solomon (<reflink target="XXX">Cant. 4:3, 13, etc.</reflink>). The skirt of the high priest's blue robe and ephod was adorned with the representation of pomegranates, alternating with golden bells (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 28:33,34</reflink>), as also were the "chapiters upon the two pillars" (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 7:20</reflink>) which "stood before the house."</description>

  <item id="Pommels">
    <description>(<reflink target="XXX">2 Chr. 4:12, 13</reflink>), or bowls (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 7:41</reflink>), were balls or "rounded knobs" on the top of the chapiters (q.v.).</description>

  </item>
  <item id="Pontus">
    <description>a province of Asia Minor, stretching along the southern coast of the Euxine Sea, corresponding nearly to the modern province of Trebizond. In the time of the apostles it was a Roman province. Strangers from this province were at Jerusalem at Pentecost (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 2:9</reflink>), and to "strangers scattered throughout Pontus," among others, Peter addresses his first epistle (<reflink target="XXX">1 Pet. 1:1</reflink>). It was evidently the resort of many Jews of the Dispersion. Aquila was a native of Pontus (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 18:2</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Pool">
    <description>a pond, or reservoir, for holding water (Heb. berekhah; modern Arabic, birket), an artificial cistern or tank. Mention is made of the pool of Gibeon (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 2:13</reflink>); the pool of Hebron (4:12); the upper pool at Jerusalem (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 18:17; 20:20</reflink>); the pool of Samaria (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 22:38</reflink>); the king's pool (<reflink target="XXX">Neh. 2:14</reflink>); the pool of Siloah (<reflink target="XXX">Neh. 3:15; Eccles. 2:6</reflink>); the fishpools of Heshbon (<reflink target="XXX">Cant. 7:4</reflink>); the "lower pool," and the "old pool" (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 22:9,11</reflink>).</description>
    <description>The "pool of Bethesda" (<reflink target="XXX">John 5:2,4, 7</reflink>) and the "pool of Siloam" (<reflink target="XXX">John 9:7, 11</reflink>) are also mentioned. Isaiah (35:7) says, "The parched ground shall become a pool." This is rendered in the Revised Version "glowing sand," etc. (marg., "the mirage," etc.). The Arabs call the mirage "serab," plainly the same as the Hebrew word _sarab_, here rendered "parched ground." "The mirage shall become a pool", i.e., the mock-lake of the burning desert shall become a real lake, "the pledge of refreshment and joy." The "pools" spoken of in Isa. 14:23 are the marshes caused by the ruin of the canals of the Euphrates in the neighbourhood of Babylon.</description>
    <description>The cisterns or pools of the Holy City are for the most part excavations beneath the surface. Such are the vast cisterns in the temple hill that have recently been discovered by the engineers of the Palestine Exploration Fund. These underground caverns are about thirty-five in number, and are capable of storing about ten million gallons of water. They are connected with one another by passages and tunnels.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Pools of Solomon">
    <description>the name given to three large open cisterns at Etam, at the head of the Wady Urtas, having an average length of 400 feet by 220 in breadth, and 20 to 30 in depth. These pools derive their chief supply of water from a spring called "the sealed fountain," about 200 yards to the north-west of the upper pool, to which it is conveyed by a large subterranean passage. They are 150 feet distant from each other, and each pool is 20 feet lower than that above it, the conduits being so arranged that the lowest, which is the largest and finest of the three, is filled first, and then in succession the others. It has been estimated that these pools cover in all a space of about 7 acres, and are capable of containing three million gallons of water. They were, as is generally supposed, constructed in the days of Solomon. They are probably referred to in Eccles. 2:6. On the fourth day after his victory over the Ammonites, etc., in the wilderness of Tekoa, Jehoshaphat assembled his army in the valley of Berachah ("blessing"), and there blessed the Lord. Berachah has been identified with the modern Bereikut, some 5 miles south of Wady Urtas, and hence the "valley of Berachah" may be this valley of pools, for the word means both "blessing" and "pools;" and it has been supposed, therefore, that this victory was celebrated beside Solomon's pools (<reflink target="XXX">2 Chr. 20:26</reflink>).</description>
    <description>These pools were primarily designed to supply Jerusalem with water. From the lower pool an aqueduct has been traced conveying the water through Bethlehem and across the valley of Gihon, and along the west slope of the Tyropoeon valley, till it finds its way into the great cisterns underneath the temple hill. The water, however, from the pools reaches now only to Bethlehem. The aqueduct beyond this has been destroyed.</description>

  <item id="Poor">
    <description>The Mosaic legislation regarding the poor is specially important. (1.) They had the right of gleaning the fields (<reflink target="XXX">Lev. 19:9, 10; Deut. 24:19,21</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(2.) In the sabbatical year they were to have their share of the produce of the fields and the vineyards (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 23:11; Lev. 25:6</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(3.) In the year of jubilee they recovered their property (<reflink target="XXX">Lev. 25:25-30</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(4.) Usury was forbidden, and the pledged raiment was to be returned before the sun went down (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 22:25-27; Deut. 24:10-13</reflink>). The rich were to be generous to the poor (<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 15:7-11</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(5.) In the sabbatical and jubilee years the bond-servant was to go free (<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 15:12-15; Lev. 25:39-42, 47-54</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(6.) Certain portions from the tithes were assigned to the poor (<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 14:28, 29; 26:12, 13</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(7.) They shared in the feasts (<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 16:11, 14; Neh. 8:10</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(8.) Wages were to be paid at the close of each day (<reflink target="XXX">Lev. 19:13</reflink>).</description>
    <description>In the New Testament (<reflink target="XXX">Luke 3:11; 14:13; Acts 6:1; Gal. 2:10; James 2:15, 16</reflink>) we have similar injunctions given with reference to the poor. Begging was not common under the Old Testament, while it was so in the New Testament times (<reflink target="XXX">Luke 16:20, 21, etc.</reflink>). But begging in the case of those who are able to work is forbidden, and all such are enjoined to "work with their own hands" as a Christian duty (<reflink target="XXX">1 Thess. 4:11; 2 Thess. 3:7-13; Eph. 4:28</reflink>). This word is used figuratively in Matt. 5:3; Luke 6:20; 2 Cor. 8:9; Rev. 3:17.</description>

  <item id="Poplar">
    <description>Heb. libneh, "white", (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 30:37; Hos. 4:13</reflink>), in all probability the storax tree (Styrax officinalis) or white poplar, distinguished by its white blossoms and pale leaves. It is common in the Anti-Libanus. Other species of the poplar are found in Palestine, such as the white poplar (P. alba) of our own country, the black poplar (P. nigra), and the aspen (P. tremula).

  <item id="Porch, Solomon's">
    <description>a colonnade on the east of the temple, so called from a tradition that it was a relic of Solomon's temple left standing after the destruction of Jerusalem by the Babylonians. (Comp. 1 Kings 7:6.) The word "porch" is in the New Testament the rendering of three different Greek words:</description>
    <description>(1.) Stoa, meaning a portico or veranda (<reflink target="XXX">John 5:2; 10:23; Acts 3:11; 5:12</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(2.) Pulon, a gateway (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 26:71</reflink>).</description>

    <description>a gate-keeper (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 18:26; 2 Kings 7:10; 1 Chr. 9:21; 2 Chr. 8:14</reflink>). Of the Levites, 4,000 were appointed as porters by David (<reflink target="XXX">1 Chr. 23:5</reflink>), who were arranged according to their families (26:1-19) to take charge of the doors and gates of the temple. They were sometimes employed as musicians (<reflink target="XXX">1 Chr. 15:18</reflink>).</description>

Such messengers were used from very early times. Those employed by the Hebrew kings had a military character (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 22:17; 2 Kings 10:25, "guard," marg. "runners"</reflink>). The modern system of postal communication was first established by Louis XI. of France in A.D. 1464.</description>

  <item id="Potiphar">
    <description>dedicated to Ra; i.e., to the sun-god, the Egyptian to whom the Ishmaelites sold Joseph (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 39:1</reflink>). He was "captain of the guard", i.e., chief, probably, of the state police, who, while they formed part of the Egyptian army, were also largely employed in civil duties (37:36; marg., "chief of the executioners"). Joseph, though a foreigner, gradually gained his confidence, and became overseer over all his possessions. Believing the false accusation which his profligate wife brought against Joseph, Potiphar cast him into prison, where he remained for some years.

  <item id="Potters field">
    <description>the name given to the piece of ground which was afterwards bought with the money that had been given to Judas. It was called the "field of blood" (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 27:7-10</reflink>). Tradition places it in the valley of Hinnom. (<see target="x-self">See ACELDAMA.</see>)</description>

  <item id="Pottery">
    <description>the art of, was early practised among all nations. Various materials seem to have been employed by the potter. Earthenware is mentioned in connection with the history of Melchizedek (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 14:18</reflink>), of Abraham (18:4-8), of Rebekah (27:14), of Rachel (29:2, 3, 8, 10). The potter's wheel is mentioned by Jeremiah (18:3). See also 1 Chr. 4:23; Ps. 2:9; Isa. 45:9; 64:8; Jer. 19:1; Lam. 4:2; Zech. 11:13; Rom. 9:21.</description>

  <item id="Praetorium">
    <description>The Greek word (praitorion) thus rendered in Mark 15:16 is rendered "common hall" (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 27:27, marg., "governor's house"</reflink>), "judgment hall," (<reflink target="XXX">John 18:28, 33, marg., "Pilate's house", 19:9; Acts 23:35</reflink>), "palace" (<reflink target="XXX">Phil. 1:13</reflink>). This is properly a military word. It denotes (1) the general's tent or headquarters; (2) the governor's residence, as in Acts 23:35 (R.V., "palace"); and (3) the praetorian guard (<see target="x-self">See PALACE</see>), or the camp or quarters of the praetorian cohorts (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 28:16</reflink>), the imperial guards in immediate attendance on the emperor, who was "praetor" or commander-in-chief.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Prayer">
    <description>is converse with God; the intercourse of the soul with God, not in contemplation or meditation, but in direct address to him. Prayer may be oral or mental, occasional or constant, ejaculatory or formal. It is a "beseeching the Lord" (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 32:11</reflink>); "pouring out the soul before the Lord" (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 1:15</reflink>); "praying and crying to heaven" (<reflink target="XXX">2 Chr. 32:20</reflink>); "seeking unto God and making supplication" (<reflink target="XXX">Job 8:5</reflink>); "drawing near to God" (<reflink target="XXX">Ps. 73:28</reflink>); "bowing the knees" (<reflink target="XXX">Eph. 3:14</reflink>).</description>
    <description>Prayer presupposes a belief in the personality of God, his ability and willingness to hold intercourse with us, his personal control of all things and of all his creatures and all their actions.</description>
    <description>Acceptable prayer must be sincere (<reflink target="XXX">Heb. 10:22</reflink>), offered with reverence and godly fear, with a humble sense of our own insignificance as creatures and of our own unworthiness as sinners, with earnest importunity, and with unhesitating submission to the divine will. Prayer must also be offered in the faith that God is, and is the hearer and answerer of prayer, and that he will fulfil his word, "Ask, and ye shall receive" (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 7:7, 8; 21:22; Mark 11:24; John 14:13, 14</reflink>), and in the name of Christ (16:23, 24; 15:16; Eph. 2:18; 5:20; Col. 3:17; 1 Pet. 2:5).</description>
    <description>Prayer is of different kinds, secret (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 6:6</reflink>); social, as family prayers, and in social worship; and public, in the service of the sanctuary.</description>
    <description>Intercessory prayer is enjoined (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 6:23; Job 42:8; Isa. 62:6; Ps. 122:6; 1 Tim. 2:1; James 5:14</reflink>), and there are many instances on record of answers having been given to such prayers, e.g., of Abraham (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 17:18, 20; 18:23-32; 20:7, 17, 18</reflink>), of Moses for Pharaoh (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 8:12, 13, 30, 31; Ex. 9:33</reflink>), for the Israelites (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 17:11, 13; 32:11-14, 31-34; Num. 21:7, 8; Deut. 9:18, 19, 25</reflink>), for Miriam (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 12:13</reflink>), for Aaron (<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 9:20</reflink>), of Samuel (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 7:5-12</reflink>), of Solomon (1 Kings 8; 2 Chr. 6), Elijah (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 17:20-23</reflink>), Elisha (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 4:33-36</reflink>), Isaiah (2 Kings 19), Jeremiah (42:2-10), Peter (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 9:40</reflink>), the church (12:5-12), Paul (28:8).</description>
    <description>No rules are anywhere in Scripture laid down for the manner of prayer or the attitude to be assumed by the suppliant. There is mention made of kneeling in prayer (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 8:54; 2 Chr. 6:13; Ps. 95:6; Isa. 45:23; Luke 22:41; Acts 7:60; 9:40; Eph. 3:14, etc.</reflink>); of bowing and falling prostrate (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 24:26, 52; Ex. 4:31; 12:27; Matt. 26:39; Mark 14:35, etc.</reflink>); of spreading out the hands (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 8:22, 38, 54; Ps. 28:2; 63:4; 88:9; 1 Tim. 2:8, etc.</reflink>); and of standing (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 1:26; 1 Kings 8:14, 55; 2 Chr. 20:9; Mark 11:25; Luke 18:11, 13</reflink>).</description>
    <description>If we except the "Lord's Prayer" (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 6:9-13</reflink>), which is, however, rather a model or pattern of prayer than a set prayer to be offered up, we have no special form of prayer for general use given us in Scripture.</description>
    <description>Prayer is frequently enjoined in Scripture (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 22:23, 27; 1 Kings 3:5; 2 Chr. 7:14; Ps. 37:4; Isa. 55:6; Joel 2:32; Ezek. 36:37, etc.</reflink>), and we have very many testimonies that it has been answered (<reflink target="XXX">Ps. 3:4; 4:1; 6:8; 18:6; 28:6; 30:2; 34:4; 118:5; James 5:16-18, etc.</reflink>).</description>

  <item id="Predestination">
    <description>This word is properly used only with reference to God's plan or purpose of salvation. The Greek word rendered "predestinate" is found only in these six passages, Acts 4:28; Rom. 8:29, 30; 1 Cor. 2:7; Eph. 1:5, 11; and in all of them it has the same meaning. They teach that the eternal, sovereign, immutable, and unconditional decree or "determinate purpose" of God governs all events.</description>
    <description>This doctrine of predestination or election is beset with many difficulties. It belongs to the "secret things" of God. But if we take the revealed word of God as our guide, we must accept this doctrine with all its mysteriousness, and settle all our questionings in the humble, devout acknowledgment, "Even so, Father: for so it seemed good in thy sight."</description>
    <description>For the teaching of Scripture on this subject let the following passages be examined in addition to those referred to above; Gen. 21:12; Ex. 9:16; 33:19; Deut. 10:15; 32:8; Josh. 11:20; 1 Sam. 12:22; 2 Chr. 6:6; Ps. 33:12; 65:4; 78:68; 135:4; Isa. 41:1-10; Jer. 1:5; Mark 13:20; Luke 22:22; John 6:37; 15:16; 17:2, 6, 9; Acts 2:28; 3:18; 4:28; 13:48; 17:26; Rom. 9:11, 18, 21; 11:5; Eph. 3:11; 1 Thess. 1:4; 2 Thess. 2:13; 2 Tim. 1:9; Titus 1:2; 1 Pet. 1:2. (<see target="x-self">See DECREES OF GOD; ELECTION.</see>)</description>
    <description>Hodge has well remarked that, "rightly understood, this doctrine (1) exalts the majesty and absolute sovereignty of God, while it illustrates the riches of his free grace and his just displeasure with sin. (2.) It enforces upon us the essential truth that salvation is entirely of grace. That no one can either complain if passed over, or boast himself if saved. (3.) It brings the inquirer to absolute self-despair and the cordial embrace of the free offer of Christ. (4.) In the case of the believer who has the witness in himself, this doctrine at once deepens his humility and elevates his confidence to the full assurance of hope" (Outlines).</description>

  <item id="Presidents">
    <description>Three presidents are mentioned, of whom Daniel was the first (<reflink target="XXX">Dan. 6:2-7</reflink>). The name in the original is _sarkhin_, probably a Persian word meaning perfects or ministers.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Priest">
    <description>The Heb. kohen, Gr. hierus, Lat. sacerdos, always denote one who offers sacrifices.</description>
    <description>At first every man was his own priest, and presented his own sacrifices before God. Afterwards that office devolved on the head of the family, as in the cases of Noah (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 8:20</reflink>), Abraham (12:7; 13:4), Isaac (26:25), Jacob (31:54), and Job (<reflink target="XXX">Job 1:5</reflink>).</description>
    <description>The name first occurs as applied to Melchizedek (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 14:18</reflink>). Under the Levitical arrangements the office of the priesthood was limited to the tribe of Levi, and to only one family of that tribe, the family of Aaron. Certain laws respecting the qualifications of priests are given in Lev. 21:16-23. There are ordinances also regarding the priests' dress (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 28:40-43</reflink>) and the manner of their consecration to the office (29:1-37).</description>
    <description>Their duties were manifold (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 27:20, 21; 29:38-44; Lev. 6:12; 10:11; 24:8; Num. 10:1-10; Deut. 17:8-13; 33:10; Mal. 2:7</reflink>). They represented the people before God, and offered the various sacrifices prescribed in the law.</description>
    <description>In the time of David the priests were divided into twenty-four courses or classes (<reflink target="XXX">1 Chr. 24:7-18</reflink>). This number was retained after the Captivity (<reflink target="XXX">Ezra 2:36-39; Neh. 7:39-42</reflink>).</description>
    <description>"The priests were not distributed over the country, but lived together in certain cities [forty-eight in number, of which six were cities of refuge, q.v.], which had been assigned to their use. From thence they went up by turns to minister in the temple at Jerusalem. Thus the religious instruction of the people in the country generally was left to the heads of families, until the establishment of synagogues, an event which did not take place till the return from the Captivity, and which was the main source of the freedom from idolatry that became as marked a feature of the Jewish people thenceforward as its practice had been hitherto their great national sin."</description>
    <description>The whole priestly system of the Jews was typical. It was a shadow of which the body is Christ. The priests all prefigured the great Priest who offered "one sacrifice for sins" "once for all" (<reflink target="XXX">Heb. 10:10, 12</reflink>). There is now no human priesthood. (<see target="x-self">See Epistle to the Hebrews throughout.</see>) The term "priest" is indeed applied to believers (<reflink target="XXX">1 Pet. 2:9; Rev. 1:6</reflink>), but in these cases it implies no sacerdotal functions. All true believers are now "kings and priests unto God." As priests they have free access into the holiest of all, and offer up the sacrifices of praise and thanksgiving, and the sacrifices of grateful service from day to day.</description>

  <item id="Prince">
    <description>the title generally applied to the chief men of the state. The "princes of the provinces" (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 20:14</reflink>) were the governors or lord-lieutenants of the provinces. So also the "princes" mentioned in Dan. 6:1, 3, 4, 6, 7 were the officers who administered the affairs of the provinces; the "satraps" (as rendered in R.V.). These are also called "lieutenants" (<reflink target="XXX">Esther 3:12; 8:9; R.V., "satraps"</reflink>). The promised Saviour is called by Daniel (9:25) "Messiah the Prince" (Heb. nagid); compare Acts 3:15; 5:31. The angel Micheal is called (<reflink target="XXX">Dan. 12:1</reflink>) a "prince" (Heb. sar, whence "Sarah," the "princes").</description>

  <item id="Priscilla">
    <description>the wife of Aquila (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 18:2</reflink>), who is never mentioned without her. Her name sometimes takes the precedence of his (<reflink target="XXX">Rom. 16:3; 2 Tim. 4:19</reflink>). She took part with Aquila (q.v.) in insturcting Apollos (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 18:26</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Prison">
    <description>The first occasion on which we read of a prison is in the history of Joseph in Egypt. Then Potiphar, "Joseph's master, took him, and put him into the prison, a place where the king's prisoners were bound" (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 39:20-23</reflink>). The Heb. word here used (sohar) means properly a round tower or fortress. It seems to have been a part of Potiphar's house, a place in which state prisoners were kept.</description>
    <description>The Mosaic law made no provision for imprisonment as a punishment. In the wilderness two persons were "put in ward" (<reflink target="XXX">Lev. 24:12; Num. 15:34</reflink>), but it was only till the mind of God concerning them should be ascertained. Prisons and prisoners are mentioned in the book of Psalms (69:33; 79:11; 142:7). Samson was confined in a Philistine prison (<reflink target="XXX">Judg. 16:21, 25</reflink>). In the subsequent history of Israel frequent references are made to prisons (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 22:27; 2 Kings 17:4; 25:27, 29; 2 Chr. 16:10; Isa. 42:7; Jer. 32:2</reflink>). Prisons seem to have been common in New Testament times (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 11:2; 25:36, 43</reflink>). The apostles were put into the "common prison" at the instance of the Jewish council (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 5:18, 23; 8:3</reflink>); and at Philippi Paul and Silas were thrust into the "inner prison" (16:24; comp. 4:3; 12:4, 5).</description>

  <item id="Prophecy">
    <description>or prediction, was one of the functions of the prophet. It has been defined as a "miracle of knowledge, a declaration or description or representation of something future, beyond the power of human sagacity to foresee, discern, or conjecture." (<see target="x-self">See PROPHET.</see>)</description>
    <description>The great prediction which runs like a golden thread through the whole contents of the Old Testament is that regarding the coming and work of the Messiah; and the great use of prophecy was to perpetuate faith in his coming, and to prepare the world for that event. But there are many subordinate and intermediate prophecies also which hold an important place in the great chain of events which illustrate the sovereignty and all-wise overruling providence of God.</description>
    <description>Then there are many prophecies regarding the Jewish nation, its founder Abraham (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 12:1-3; 13:16; 15:5; 17:2, 4-6, etc.</reflink>), and his posterity, Isaac and Jacob and their descendants (12:7; 13:14, 15, 17; 15:18-21; Ex. 3:8, 17), which have all been fulfilled. The twenty-eighth chapter of Deuteronomy contains a series of predictions which are even now in the present day being fulfilled. In the writings of the prophets Isaiah (2:18-21), Jeremiah (27:3-7; 29:11-14), Ezekiel (5:12; 8), Daniel (8; 9:26, 27), Hosea (9:17), there are also many prophecies regarding the events which were to befall that people.</description>
    <description>There is in like manner a large number of prophecies relating to those nations with which the Jews came into contact, as Tyre (<reflink target="XXX">Ezek. 26:3-5, 14-21</reflink>), Egypt (<reflink target="XXX">Ezek. 29:10, 15; 30:6, 12, 13</reflink>), Ethiopia (<reflink target="XXX">Nahum 3:8-10</reflink>), Nineveh (<reflink target="XXX">Nahum 1:10; 2:8-13; 3:17-19</reflink>), Babylon (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 13:4; Jer. 51:7; Isa. 44:27; Jer. 50:38; 51:36, 39, 57</reflink>), the land of the Philistines (<reflink target="XXX">Jer. 47:4-7; Ezek. 25:15-17; Amos 1:6-8; Zeph. 2:4-7; Zech. 9:5-8</reflink>), and of the four great monarchies (<reflink target="XXX">Dan. 2:39, 40; 7:17-24; 8:9</reflink>).</description>
    <description>But the great body of Old Testament prophecy relates directly to the advent of the Messiah, beginning with Gen. 3:15, the first great promise, and extending in ever-increasing fulness and clearness all through to the very close of the canon. The Messianic prophecies are too numerous to be quoted. "To him gave all the prophets witness." (<reflink target="XXX">Comp. Micah 5:2; Hag. 2:6-9; Isa. 7:14; 9:6, 7; 11:1, 2; 53; 60:10, 13; Ps. 16:11; 68:18.</reflink>)</description>
    <description>Many predictions also were delivered by Jesus and his apostles. Those of Christ were very numerous. (<reflink target="XXX">Comp. Matt. 10:23:24; 11:23; 19:28; 21:43, 44; 24; 25:31-46; 26:17-35, 46, 64; Mark 9:1; 10:30; 13; 11:1-6, 14; 14:12-31, 42, 62; 16:17, etc.</reflink>)</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Prophet">
    <description>(Heb. nabi, from a root meaning "to bubble forth, as from a fountain," hence "to utter", comp. Ps. 45:1). This Hebrew word is the first and the most generally used for a prophet. In the time of Samuel another word, _ro'eh_, "seer", began to be used (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 9:9</reflink>). It occurs seven times in reference to Samuel. Afterwards another word, _hozeh_, "seer" (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 24:11</reflink>), was employed. In 1 Ch. 29:29 all these three words are used: "Samuel the seer (ro'eh), Nathan the prophet (nabi'), Gad the seer" (hozeh). In Josh. 13:22 Balaam is called (Heb.) a _kosem_ "diviner," a word used only of a false prophet.</description>
    <description>The "prophet" proclaimed the message given to him, as the "seer" beheld the vision of God. (<reflink target="XXX">See Num. 12:6, 8.</reflink>) Thus a prophet was a spokesman for God; he spake in God's name and by his authority (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 7:1</reflink>). He is the mouth by which God speaks to men (<reflink target="XXX">Jer. 1:9; Isa. 51:16</reflink>), and hence what the prophet says is not of man but of God (<reflink target="XXX">2 Pet. 1:20, 21; comp. Heb. 3:7; Acts 4:25; 28:25</reflink>). Prophets were the immediate organs of God for the communication of his mind and will to men (<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 18:18, 19</reflink>). The whole Word of God may in this general sense be spoken of as prophetic, inasmuch as it was written by men who received the revelation they communicated from God, no matter what its nature might be. The foretelling of future events was not a necessary but only an incidental part of the prophetic office. The great task assigned to the prophets whom God raised up among the people was "to correct moral and religious abuses, to proclaim the great moral and religious truths which are connected with the character of God, and which lie at the foundation of his government."</description>
    <description>Any one being a spokesman for God to man might thus be called a prophet. Thus Enoch, Abraham, and the patriarchs, as bearers of God's message (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 20:7; Ex. 7:1; Ps. 105:15</reflink>), as also Moses (<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 18:15; 34:10; Hos. 12:13</reflink>), are ranked among the prophets. The seventy elders of Israel (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 11:16-29</reflink>), "when the spirit rested upon them, prophesied;" Asaph and Jeduthun "prophesied with a harp" (<reflink target="XXX">1 Chr. 25:3</reflink>). Miriam and Deborah were prophetesses (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 15:20; Judg. 4:4</reflink>). The title thus has a general application to all who have messages from God to men.</description>
    <description>But while the prophetic gift was thus exercised from the beginning, the prophetical order as such began with Samuel. Colleges, "schools of the prophets", were instituted for the training of prophets, who were constituted, a distinct order (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 19:18-24; 2 Kings 2:3, 15; 4:38</reflink>), which continued to the close of the Old Testament. Such "schools" were established at Ramah, Bethel, Gilgal, Gibeah, and Jericho. The "sons" or "disciples" of the prophets were young men (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 5:22; 9:1, 4</reflink>) who lived together at these different "schools" (4:38-41). These young men were taught not only the rudiments of secular knowledge, but they were brought up to exercise the office of prophet, "to preach pure morality and the heart-felt worship of Jehovah, and to act along and co-ordinately with the priesthood and monarchy in guiding the state aright and checking all attempts at illegality and tyranny."</description>
    <description>In New Testament times the prophetical office was continued. Our Lord is frequently spoken of as a prophet (<reflink target="XXX">Luke 13:33; 24:19</reflink>). He was and is the great Prophet of the Church. There was also in the Church a distinct order of prophets (<reflink target="XXX">1 Cor. 12:28; Eph. 2:20; 3:5</reflink>), who made new revelations from God. They differed from the "teacher," whose office it was to impart truths already revealed.</description>
    <description>Of the Old Testament prophets there are sixteen, whose prophecies form part of the inspired canon. These are divided into four groups:</description>
    <description>(1.) The prophets of the northern kingdom (Israel), viz., Hosea, Amos, Joel, Jonah.</description>
    <description>(2.) The prophets of Judah, viz., Isaiah, Jeremiah, Obadiah, Micah, Nahum, Habakkuk, Zephaniah.</description>
    <description>(3.) The prophets of Captivity, viz., Ezekiel and Daniel.</description>
    <description>(4.) The prophets of the Restoration, viz., Haggai, Zechariah, and Malachi.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Propitiation">
    <description>that by which God is rendered propitious, i.e., by which it becomes consistent with his character and government to pardon and bless the sinner. The propitiation does not procure his love or make him loving; it only renders it consistent for him to execise his love towards sinners.</description>
    <description>In Rom. 3:25 and Heb. 9:5 (A.V., "mercy-seat") the Greek word _hilasterion_ is used. It is the word employed by the LXX. translators in Ex. 25:17 and elsewhere as the equivalent for the Hebrew _kapporeth_, which means "covering," and is used of the lid of the ark of the covenant (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 25:21; 30:6</reflink>). This Greek word (hilasterion) came to denote not only the mercy-seat or lid of the ark, but also propitation or reconciliation by blood. On the great day of atonement the high priest carried the blood of the sacrifice he offered for all the people within the veil and sprinkled with it the "mercy-seat," and so made propitiation.</description>
    <description>In 1 John 2:2; 4:10, Christ is called the "propitiation for our sins." Here a different Greek word is used (hilasmos). Christ is "the propitiation," because by his becoming our substitute and assuming our obligations he expiated our guilt, covered it, by the vicarious punishment which he endured. (<reflink target="XXX">Comp. Heb. 2:17, where the expression "make reconciliation" of the A.V. is more correctly in the R.V. "make propitiation."</reflink>)</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Proportion of faith">
    <description>(<reflink target="XXX">Rom. 12:6</reflink>). Paul says here that each one was to exercise his gift of prophecy, i.e., of teaching, "according to the proportion of faith." The meaning is, that the utterances of the "prophet" were not to fluctuate according to his own impulses or independent thoughts, but were to be adjusted to the truth revealed to him as a beliver, i.e., were to be in accordance with it.</description>
    <description>In post-Reformation times this phrase was used as meaning that all Scripture was to be interpreted with reference to all other Scripture, i.e., that no words or expressions were to be isolated or interpreted in a way contrary to its general teaching. This was also called the "analogy of faith."</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Proselyte">
    <description>is used in the LXX. for "stranger" (<reflink target="XXX">1 Chr. 22:2</reflink>), i.e., a comer to Palestine; a sojourner in the land (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 12:48; 20:10; 22:21</reflink>), and in the New Testament for a convert to Judaism. There were such converts from early times (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 56:3; Neh. 10:28; Esther 8:17</reflink>). The law of Moses made specific regulations regarding the admission into the Jewish church of such as were not born Israelites (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 20:10; 23:12; 12:19, 48; Deut. 5:14; 16:11, 14, etc.</reflink>). The Kenites, the Gibeonites, the Cherethites, and the Pelethites were thus admitted to the privileges of Israelites. Thus also we hear of individual proselytes who rose to positions of prominence in Israel, as of Doeg the Edomite, Uriah the Hittite, Araunah the Jebusite, Zelek the Ammonite, Ithmah and Ebedmelech the Ethiopians.</description>
    <description>In the time of Solomon there were one hundred and fifty-three thousand six hundred strangers in the land of Israel (<reflink target="XXX">1 Chr. 22:2; 2 Chr. 2:17, 18</reflink>). And the prophets speak of the time as coming when the strangers shall share in all the privileges of Israel (<reflink target="XXX">Ezek. 47:22; Isa. 2:2; 11:10; 56:3-6; Micah 4:1</reflink>). Accordingly, in New Testament times, we read of proselytes in the synagogues, (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 10:2, 7; 13:42, 43, 50; 17:4; 18:7; Luke 7:5</reflink>). The "religious proselytes" here spoken of were proselytes of righteousness, as distinguished from proselytes of the gate.</description>
    <description>The distinction between "proselytes of the gate" (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 20:10</reflink>) and "proselytes of righteousness" originated only with the rabbis. According to them, the "proselytes of the gate" (half proselytes) were not required to be circumcised nor to comply with the Mosaic ceremonial law. They were bound only to conform to the so-called seven precepts of Noah, viz., to abstain from idolatry, blasphemy, bloodshed, uncleaness, the eating of blood, theft, and to yield obedience to the authorities. Besides these laws, however, they were required to abstain from work on the Sabbath, and to refrain from the use of leavened bread during the time of the Passover.</description>
    <description>The "proselytes of righteousness", religious or devout proselytes (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 13:43</reflink>), were bound to all the doctrines and precepts of the Jewish economy, and were members of the synagogue in full communion.</description>
    <description>The name "proselyte" occurs in the New Testament only in Matt. 23:15; Acts 2:10; 6:5; 13:43. The name by which they are commonly designated is that of "devout men," or men "fearing God" or "worshipping God."</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Proverb">
    <description>a trite maxim; a similitude; a parable. The Hebrew word thus rendered (mashal) has a wide signification. It comes from a root meaning "to be like," "parable." Rendered "proverb" in Isa. 14:4; Hab. 2:6; "dark saying" in Ps. 49:4, Num. 12:8. Ahab's defiant words in answer to the insolent demands of Benhadad, "Let not him that girdeth on his harness boast himself as he that putteth it off," is a well known instance of a proverbial saying (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 20:11</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Proverbs, Book of">
    <description>a collection of moral and philosophical maxims of a wide range of subjects presented in a poetic form. This book sets forth the "philosophy of practical life. It is the sign to us that the Bible does not despise common sense and discretion. It impresses upon us in the most forcible manner the value of intelligence and prudence and of a good education. The whole strength of the Hebrew language and of the sacred authority of the book is thrown upon these homely truths. It deals, too, in that refined, discriminating, careful view of the finer shades of human character so often overlooked by theologians, but so necessary to any true estimate of human life" (Stanley's Jewish Church).</description>
    <description>As to the origin of this book, "it is probable that Solomon gathered and recast many proverbs which sprang from human experience in preceeding ages and were floating past him on the tide of time, and that he also elaborated many new ones from the material of his own experience. Towards the close of the book, indeed, are preserved some of Solomon's own sayings that seem to have fallen from his lips in later life and been gathered by other hands' (Arnot's Laws from Heaven, etc.)</description>
    <description>This book is usually divided into three parts: (1.) Consisting of ch. 1-9, which contain an exhibition of wisdom as the highest good.</description>
    <description>(2.) Consisting of ch. 10-24.</description>
    <description>(3.) Containing proverbs of Solomon "which the men of Hezekiah, the king of Judah, collected" (ch. 25-29).</description>
    <description>These are followed by two supplements, (1) "The words of Agur" (ch. 30); and (2) "The words of king Lemuel" (ch. 31).</description>
    <description>Solomon is said to have written three thousand proverbs, and those contained in this book may be a selection from these (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 4:32</reflink>). In the New Testament there are thirty-five direct quotations from this book or allusions to it.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Providence">
    <description>literally means foresight, but is generally used to denote God's preserving and governing all things by means of second causes (<reflink target="XXX">Ps. 18:35; 63:8; Acts 17:28; Col. 1:17; Heb. 1:3</reflink>). God's providence extends to the natural world (<reflink target="XXX">Ps. 104:14; 135:5-7; Acts 14:17</reflink>), the brute creation (<reflink target="XXX">Ps. 104:21-29; Matt. 6:26; 10:29</reflink>), and the affairs of men (<reflink target="XXX">1 Chr. 16:31; Ps. 47:7; Prov. 21:1; Job 12:23; Dan. 2:21; 4:25</reflink>), and of individuals (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 2:6; Ps. 18:30; Luke 1:53; James 4:13-15</reflink>). It extends also to the free actions of men (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 12:36; 1 Sam. 24:9-15; Ps. 33:14, 15; Prov. 16:1; 19:21; 20:24; 21:1</reflink>), and things sinful (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 16:10; 24:1; Rom. 11:32; Acts 4:27, 28</reflink>), as well as to their good actions (<reflink target="XXX">Phil. 2:13; 4:13; 2 Cor. 12:9, 10; Eph. 2:10; Gal. 5:22-25</reflink>).</description>
    <description>As regards sinful actions of men, they are represented as occurring by God's permission (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 45:5; 50:20. Comp. 1 Sam. 6:6; Ex. 7:13; 14:17; Acts 2:3; 3:18; 4:27, 28</reflink>), and as controlled (<reflink target="XXX">Ps. 76:10</reflink>) and overruled for good (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 50:20; Acts 3:13</reflink>). God does not cause or approve of sin, but only limits, restrains, overrules it for good.</description>
    <description>The mode of God's providential government is altogether unexplained. We only know that it is a fact that God does govern all his creatures and all their actions; that this government is universal (<reflink target="XXX">Ps. 103:17-19</reflink>), particular (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 10:29-31</reflink>), efficacious (<reflink target="XXX">Ps. 33:11; Job 23:13</reflink>), embraces events apparently contingent (<reflink target="XXX">Prov. 16:9, 33; 19:21; 21:1</reflink>), is consistent with his own perfection (<reflink target="XXX">2 Tim. 2:13</reflink>), and to his own glory (<reflink target="XXX">Rom. 9:17; 11:36</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Psalms">
    <description>The psalms are the production of various authors. "Only a portion of the Book of Psalms claims David as its author. Other inspired poets in successive generations added now one now another contribution to the sacred collection, and thus in the wisdom of Providence it more completely reflects every phase of human emotion and circumstances than it otherwise could." But it is specially to David and his contemporaries that we owe this precious book. In the "titles" of the psalms, the genuineness of which there is no sufficient reason to doubt, 73 are ascribed to David. Peter and John (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 4:25</reflink>) ascribe to him also the second psalm, which is one of the 48 that are anonymous. About two-thirds of the whole collection have been ascribed to David.</description>
    <description>Psalms 39, 62, and 77 are addressed to Jeduthun, to be sung after his manner or in his choir. Psalms 50 and 73-83 are addressed to Asaph, as the master of his choir, to be sung in the worship of God. The "sons of Korah," who formed a leading part of the Kohathite singers (<reflink target="XXX">2 Chr. 20:19</reflink>), were intrusted with the arranging and singing of Ps. 42, 44-49, 84, 85, 87, and 88.</description>
    <description>In Luke 24:44 the word "psalms" means the Hagiographa, i.e., the holy writings, one of the sections into which the Jews divided the Old Testament. (<see target="x-self">See BIBLE.</see>)</description>
    <description>None of the psalms can be proved to have been of a later date than the time of Ezra and Nehemiah, hence the whole collection extends over a period of about 1,000 years. There are in the New Testament 116 direct quotations from the Psalter.</description>
    <description>The Psalter is divided, after the analogy of the Pentateuch, into five books, each closing with a doxology or benediction:</description>
    <description>(1.) The first book comprises the first 41 psalms, all of which are ascribed to David except 1, 2, 10, and 33, which, though anonymous, may also be ascribed to him.</description>
    <description>(2.) Book second consists of the next 31 psalms (42-72), 18 of which are ascribed to David and 1 to Solomon (the 72nd). The rest are anonymous.</description>
    <description>(3.) The third book contains 17 psalms (73-89), of which the 86th is ascribed to David, the 88th to Heman the Ezrahite, and the 89th to Ethan the Ezrahite.</description>
    <description>(4.) The fourth book also contains 17 psalms (90-106), of which the 90th is ascribed to Moses, and the 101st and 103rd to David.</description>
    <description>(5.) The fifth book contains the remaining psalms, 44 in number. Of these, 15 are ascribed to David, and the 127th to Solomon.</description>
    <description>Ps. 136 is generally called "the great hallel." But the Talmud includes also Ps. 120-135. Ps. 113-118, inclusive, constitute the "hallel" recited at the three great feasts, at the new moon, and on the eight days of the feast of dedication.</description>
    <description>"It is presumed that these several collections were made at times of high religious life: the first, probably, near the close of David's life; the second in the days of Solomon; the third by the singers of Jehoshaphat (<reflink target="XXX">2 Chr. 20:19</reflink>); the fourth by the men of Hezekiah (29, 30, 31); and the fifth in the days of Ezra."</description>
    <description>The Mosaic ritual makes no provision for the service of song in the worship of God. David first taught the Church to sing the praises of the Lord. He first introduced into the ritual of the tabernacle music and song.</description>
    <description>Divers names are given to the psalms. (1.) Some bear the Hebrew designation _shir_ (Gr. ode, a song). Thirteen have this title. It means the flow of speech, as it were, in a straight line or in a regular strain. This title includes secular as well as sacred song.</description>
    <description>(2.) Fifty-eight psalms bear the designation (Heb.) _mitsmor_ (Gr. psalmos, a psalm), a lyric ode, or a song set to music; a sacred song accompanied with a musical instrument.</description>
    <description>(3.) Ps. 145, and many others, have the designation (Heb.) _tehillah_ (Gr. hymnos, a hymn), meaning a song of praise; a song the prominent thought of which is the praise of God.</description>
    <description>(4.) Six psalms (16, 56-60) have the title (Heb.) _michtam_ (q.v.).</description>
    <description>(5.) Ps. 7 and Hab. 3 bear the title (Heb.) _shiggaion_ (q.v.).</description>

  <item id="Psaltery">
    <description>a musical instrument, supposed to have been a kind of lyre, or a harp with twelve strings. The Hebrew word nebhel, so rendered, is translated "viol" in Isa. 5:12 (R.V., "lute"); 14:11. In Dan. 3:5, 7, 10, 15, the word thus rendered is Chaldaic, pesanterin, which is supposed to be a word of Greek origin denoting an instrument of the harp kind.</description>

  <item id="Publican">
    <description>one who farmed the taxes (e.g., Zacchaeus, Luke 19:2) to be levied from a town or district, and thus undertook to pay to the supreme government a certain amount. In order to collect the taxes, the publicans employed subordinates (5:27; 15:1; 18:10), who, for their own ends, were often guilty of extortion and peculation. In New Testament times these taxes were paid to the Romans, and hence were regarded by the Jews as a very heavy burden, and hence also the collectors of taxes, who were frequently Jews, were hated, and were usually spoken of in very opprobrious terms. Jesus was accused of being a "friend of publicans and sinners" (<reflink target="XXX">Luke 7:34</reflink>).</description>

  <item id="Pul">
    <description>(1.) An Assyrian king. It has been a question whether he was identical with Tiglath-pileser III. (q.v.), or was his predecessor. The weight of evidence is certainly in favour of their identity. Pul was the throne-name he bore in Babylonia as king of Babylon, and Tiglath-pileser the throne-name he bore as king of Assyria. He was the founder of what is called the second Assyrian empire. He consolidated and organized his conquests on a large scale. He subdued Northern Syria and Hamath, and the kings of Syria rendered him homage and paid him tribute. His ambition was to found in Western Asia a kingdom which should embrace the whole civilized world, having Nineveh as its centre. Menahem, king of Israel, gave him the enormous tribute of a thousand talents of silver, "that his hand might be with him" (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 15:19; 1 Chr. 5:26</reflink>). The fact that this tribute could be paid showed the wealthy condition of the little kingdom of Israel even in this age of disorder and misgovernment. Having reduced Syria, he turned his arms against Babylon, which he subdued. The Babylonian king was slain, and Babylon and other Chaldean cities were taken, and Pul assumed the title of "King of Sumer [i.e., Shinar] and Accad." He was succeeded by Shalmanezer IV.</description>

  <item id="Punishment">
    <description>The New Testament lays down the general principles of good government, but contains no code of laws for the punishment of offenders. Punishment proceeds on the principle that there is an eternal distinction between right and wrong, and that this distinction must be maintained for its own sake. It is not primarily intended for the reformation of criminals, nor for the purpose of deterring others from sin. These results may be gained, but crime in itself demands punishment. (<see target="x-self">See MURDER ; THEFT.</see>)</description>
    <description>Endless, of the impenitent and unbelieving. The rejection of this doctrine "cuts the ground from under the gospel...blots out the attribute of retributive justice; transmutes sin into misfortune instead of guilt; turns all suffering into chastisement; converts the piacular work of Christ into moral influence...The attempt to retain the evangelical theology in connection with it is futile" (Shedd).</description>

It became a national institution by the common consent of the Jews, and is observed by them to the present day, on the 14th and 15th of the month Adar, a month before the Passover.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Purification">
    <description>the process by which a person unclean, according to the Levitical law, and thereby cut off from the sanctuary and the festivals, was restored to the enjoyment of all these privileges.</description>
    <description>The great annual purification of the people was on the Day of Atonement (q.v.).</description>
    <description>But in the details of daily life there were special causes of cermonial uncleanness which were severally provided for by ceremonial laws enacted for each separate case. For example, the case of the leper (Lev. 13, 14), and of the house defiled by leprosy (14:49-53; see also Matt. 8:2-4). Uncleanness from touching a dead body (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 19:11; Hos. 9:4; Hag. 2:13; Matt. 23:27; Luke 11:44</reflink>). The case of the high priest and of the Nazarite (<reflink target="XXX">Lev. 21:1-4, 10, 11; Num. 6:6, 7; Ezek. 44:25</reflink>). Purification was effected by bathing and washing the clothes (<reflink target="XXX">Lev. 14:8, 9</reflink>); by washing the hands (<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 21:6; Matt. 27:24</reflink>); washing the hands and feet (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 30:18-21; Heb. 6:2, "baptisms", R.V. marg., "washings;" 9:10</reflink>); sprinkling with blood and water (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 24:5-8; Heb. 9:19</reflink>), etc. Allusions to this rite are found in Ps. 26:6; 51:7; Ezek. 36:25; Heb. 10:22.</description>

As to our Lord's sending forth his disciples without money in their purses, the remark has been made that in this "there was no departure from the simple manners of the country. At this day the farmer sets out on excursions quite as extensive without a para in his purse; and a modern Moslem prophet of Tarshisha thus sends forth his apostles over this identical region. No traveller in the East would hestitate to throw himself on the hospitality of any village." Thomson's Land and the Book. (<see target="x-self">See SCRIP.</see>)</description>

Here he tarried for seven days (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 28:13, 14</reflink>). This was the great emporium for the Alexandrian corn ships. Here Paul and his companions began their journey, by the "Appian Way," to Rome. It is now called Pozzuoli.

It is described as "a large animal, over 3 1/2 feet high at the shoulder, and, with its gently-twisted horns, 2 1/2 feet long. Its colour is pure white, with the exception of a short black mane, and a tinge of tawny on the shoulders and back.", Tristram's Natural History.</description>

  <item id="Quails">
    <description>The Israelites were twice relieved in their privation by a miraculous supply of quails, (1) in the wilderness of Sin (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 16:13</reflink>), and (2) again at Kibroth-hattaavah (q.v.), Num. 11:31. God "rained flesh upon them as dust, and feathered fowls like as the sand of the sea" (<reflink target="XXX">Ps. 78:27</reflink>). The words in Num. 11:31, according to the Authorized Version, appear to denote that the quails lay one above another to the thickness of two cubits above the ground. The Revised Version, however, reads, "about two cubits above the face of the earth", i.e., the quails flew at this height, and were easily killed or caught by the hand. Being thus secured in vast numbers by the people, they "spread them all abroad" (11:32) in order to salt and dry them.</description>

  </item>
  <item id="Quarries">
    <description>(1.) The "Royal Quarries" (not found in Scripture) is the name given to the vast caverns stretching far underneath the northern hill, Bezetha, on which Jerusalem is built. Out of these mammoth caverns stones, a hard lime-stone, have been quarried in ancient times for the buildings in the city, and for the temples of Solomon, Zerubbabel, and Herod. Huge blocks of stone are still found in these caves bearing the marks of pick and chisel. The general appearance of the whole suggests to the explorer the idea that the Phoenician quarrymen have just suspended their work. The supposition that the polished blocks of stone for Solomon's temple were sent by Hiram from Lebanon or Tyre is not supported by any evidence (comp. 1 Kings 5:8). Hiram sent masons and stone-squarers to Jerusalem to assist Solomon's workmen in their great undertaking, but did not send stones to Jerusalem, where, indeed, they were not needed, as these royal quarries abundantly testify.</description>
    <description>(2.) The "quarries" (Heb. pesilim) by Gilgal (<reflink target="XXX">Judg. 3:19</reflink>), from which Ehud turned back for the purpose of carrying out his design to put Eglon king of Moab to death, were probably the "graven images" (as the word is rendered by the LXX. and the Vulgate and in the marg. A.V. and R.V.), or the idol temples the Moabites had erected at Gilgal, where the children of Israel first encamped after crossing the Jordan. The Hebrew word is rendered "graven images" in Deut. 7:25, and is not elsewhere translated "quarries."</description>

  <item id="Quaternion">
    <description>a band of four soldiers. Peter was committed by Herod to the custody of four quaternions, i.e., one quaternion for each watch of the night (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 12:4</reflink>). Thus every precaution was taken against his escape from prison. Two of each quaternion were in turn stationed at the door (12:6), and to two the apostle was chained according to Roman custom.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Queen">
    <description>No explicit mention of queens is made till we read of the "queen of Sheba." The wives of the kings of Israel are not so designated. In Ps. 45:9, the Hebrew for "queen" is not _malkah_, one actually ruling like the Queen of Sheba, but _shegal_, which simply means the king's wife. In 1 Kings 11:19, Pharaoh's wife is called "the queen," but the Hebrew word so rendered (g'birah) is simply a title of honour, denoting a royal lady, used sometimes for "queen-mother" (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 15:13; 2 Chron. 15:16</reflink>). In Cant. 6:8, 9, the king's wives are styled "queens" (Heb. melakhoth).</description>
    <description>In the New Testament we read of the "queen of the south", i.e., Southern Arabia, Sheba (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 12:42; Luke 11:31</reflink>) and the "queen of the Ethiopians" (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 8:27</reflink>), Candace.</description>

  <item id="Quiver">
    <description>the sheath for arrows. The Hebrew word (aspah) thus commonly rendered is found in Job 39:23; Ps. 127:5; Isa. 22:6; 49:2; Jer. 5:16; Lam. 3:13. In Gen. 27:3 this word is the rendering of the Hebrew _teli_, which is supposed rather to mean a suspended weapon, literally "that which hangs from one", i.e., is suspended from the shoulder or girdle.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Quotations">
    <description>from the Old Testament in the New, which are very numerous, are not made according to any uniform method. When the New Testament was written, the Old was not divided, as it now is, into chapters and verses, and hence such peculiarities as these: When Luke (20:37) refers to Ex. 3:6, he quotes from "Moses at the bush", i.e., the section containing the record of Moses at the bush. So also Mark (2:26) refers to 1 Sam. 21:1-6, in the words, "in the days of Abiathar;" and Paul (<reflink target="XXX">Rom. 11:2</reflink>) refers to 1 Kings ch. 17-19, in the words, "in Elias", i.e., in the portion of the history regarding Elias.</description>
    <description>In general, the New Testament writers quote from the Septuagint (q.v.) version of the Old Testament, as it was then in common use among the Jews. But it is noticeable that these quotations are not made in any uniform manner. Sometimes, e.g., the quotation does not agree literally either with the LXX. or the Hebrew text. This occurs in about one hundred instances. Sometimes the LXX. is literally quoted (in about ninety instances), and sometimes it is corrected or altered in the quotations (in over eighty instances).</description>
    <description>Quotations are sometimes made also directly from the Hebrew text (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 4:15, 16; John 19:37; 1 Cor. 15:54</reflink>). Besides the quotations made directly, there are found numberless allusions, more or less distinct, showing that the minds of the New Testament writers were filled with the expressions and ideas as well as historical facts recorded in the Old.</description>
    <description>There are in all two hundred and eighty-three direct quotations from the Old Testament in the New, but not one clear and certain case of quotation from the Apocrypha (q.v.).</description>
    <description>Besides quotations in the New from the Old Testament, there are in Paul's writings three quotations from certain Greek poets, Acts 17:28; 1 Cor. 15:33; Titus 1:12. These quotations are memorials of his early classical education.</description>

    <description>or Rab'bath, great. (1.) "Rabbath of the children of Ammon," the chief city of the Ammonites, among the eastern hills, some 20 miles east of the Jordan, on the southern of the two streams which united with the Jabbok. Here the bedstead of Og was preserved (<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 3:11</reflink>), perhaps as a trophy of some victory gained by the Ammonites over the king of Bashan. After David had subdued all their allies in a great war, he sent Joab with a strong force to take their city. For two years it held out against its assailants. It was while his army was engaged in this protracted siege that David was guilty of that deed of shame which left a blot on his character and cast a gloom over the rest of his life. At length, having taken the "royal city" (or the "city of waters," 2 Sam. 12:27, i.e., the lower city on the river, as distinguished from the citadel), Joab sent for David to direct the final assault (11:1; 12:26-31). The city was given up to plunder, and the people were ruthlessly put to death, and "thus did he with all the cities of the children of Ammon." The destruction of Rabbath was the last of David's conquests. His kingdom now reached its farthest limits (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 8:1-15; 1 Chr. 18:1-15</reflink>).

    <description>insolence; pride, a poetical name applied to Egypt in Ps. 87:4; 89:10; Isa. 51:9, as "the proud one."</description>
    <description>Rahab, (Heb. Rahab; i.e., "broad," "large"). When the Hebrews were encamped at Shittim, in the "Arabah" or Jordan valley opposite Jericho, ready to cross the river, Joshua, as a final preparation, sent out two spies to "spy the land." After five days they returned, having swum across the river, which at this season, the month Abib, overflowed its banks from the melting of the snow on Lebanon. The spies reported how it had fared with them (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 2:1-7</reflink>). They had been exposed to danger in Jericho, and had been saved by the fidelity of Rahab the harlot, to whose house they had gone for protection. When the city of Jericho fell (6:17-25), Rahab and her whole family were preserved according to the promise of the spies, and were incorporated among the Jewish people. She afterwards became the wife of Salmon, a prince of the tribe of Judah (<reflink target="XXX">Ruth 4:21; 1 Chr. 2:11; Matt. 1:5</reflink>). "Rahab's being asked to bring out the spies to the soldiers (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 2:3</reflink>) sent for them, is in strict keeping with Eastern manners, which would not permit any man to enter a woman's house without her permission. The fact of her covering the spies with bundles of flax which lay on her house-roof (2:6) is an 'undesigned coincidence' which strictly corroborates the narrative. It was the time of the barley harvest, and flax and barley are ripe at the same time in the Jordan valley, so that the bundles of flax stalks might have been expected to be drying just then" (Geikie's Hours, etc., ii., 390).</description>

  <item id="Rain">
    <description>There are three Hebrew words used to denote the rains of different seasons, (1.) Yoreh (<reflink target="XXX">Hos. 6:3</reflink>), or moreh (<reflink target="XXX">Joel 2:23</reflink>), denoting the former or the early rain. (2.) Melqosh, the "latter rain" (<reflink target="XXX">Prov. 16:15</reflink>). (3.) Geshem, the winter rain, "the rains." The heavy winter rain is mentioned in Gen. 7:12; Ezra 10:9; Cant. 2:11. The "early" or "former" rains commence in autumn in the latter part of October or beginning of November (<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 11:14; Joel 2:23; comp. Jer. 3:3</reflink>), and continue to fall heavily for two months. Then the heavy "winter rains" fall from the middle of December to March. There is no prolonged fair weather in Palestine between October and March. The "latter" or spring rains fall in March and April, and serve to swell the grain then coming to maturity (<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 11:14; Hos. 6:3</reflink>). After this there is ordinarily no rain, the sky being bright and cloudless till October or November.</description>
    <description>Rain is referred to symbolically in Deut. 32:2; Ps. 72:6; Isa. 44:3, 4; Hos. 10:12.</description>

  <item id="Rainbow">
    <description>caused by the reflection and refraction of the rays of the sun shining on falling rain. It was appointed as a witness of the divine faithfulness (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 9:12-17</reflink>). It existed indeed before, but it was then constituted as a sign of the covenant. Others, however (as Delitzsch, Commentary on Pentateuch), think that it "appeared then for the first time in the vault and clouds of heaven." It is argued by those holding this opinion that the atmosphere was differently constituted before the Flood. It is referred to three other times in Scripture (<reflink target="XXX">Ezek. 1:27, 28; Rev. 4:1-3; 10:1</reflink>).</description>

  </item>
  <item id="Rama">
    <description>(<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 2:18</reflink>), the Greek form of Ramah. (1.) A city first mentioned in Josh. 18:25, near Gibeah of Benjamin. It was fortified by Baasha, king of Israel (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 15:17-22; 2 Chr. 16:1-6</reflink>). Asa, king of Judah, employed Benhadad the Syrian king to drive Baasha from this city (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 15:18, 20</reflink>). Isaiah (10:29) refers to it, and also Jeremiah, who was once a prisoner there among the other captives of Jerusalem when it was taken by Nebuchadnezzar (<reflink target="XXX">Jer. 39:8-12; 40:1</reflink>). Rachel, whose tomb lies close to Bethlehem, is represented as weeping in Ramah (<reflink target="XXX">Jer. 31:15</reflink>) for her slaughtered children. This prophecy is illustrated and fulfilled in the re-awakening of Rachel's grief at the slaughter of the infants in Bethlehem (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 2:18</reflink>). It is identified with the modern village of er-Ram, between Gibeon and Beeroth, about 5 miles due north of Jerusalem. (See SAMUEL</description>
    <description>(2.) A town identified with Rameh, on the border of Asher, about 13 miles south-east of Tyre, "on a solitary hill in the midst of a basin of green fields" (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 19:29</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(3.) One of the "fenced cities" of Naphtali (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 19:36</reflink>), on a mountain slope, about seven and a half miles west-south-west of Safed, and 15 miles west of the north end of the Sea of Galilee, the present large and well-built village of Rameh.</description>

  </item>
  <item id="Ramath of the south">
    <description>(Heb. Ramath-negeb). The Heb. negeb is the general designation for south or south-west of Judah. This was one of the towns of Simeon (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 19:8</reflink>). It is the same as "south Ramoth" (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 30:27; R.V., "Ramoth of the south"</reflink>). Its site is doubtful. Some have thought it another name for Baalath-beer.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Ramath-lehi">
    <description>elevation of Lehi, or the jawbone height; i.e., the Ramah of Lehi (<reflink target="XXX">Judg. 15:15-17</reflink>). The phrase "in the jaw," ver. 19, Authorized Version, is in the margin, also in the Revised Version, "in Lehi." Here Samson slew a thousand Philistines with a jawbone.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Ramath-mizpeh">
    <description>the height of Mizpeh or of the watch-tower (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 13:26</reflink>), a place mentioned as one of the limits of Gad. There were two Mizpehs on the east of the Jordan. This was the Mizpeh where Jacob and Laban made a covenant, "Mizpeh of Gilead," called also Galeed and Jegar-sahadutha. It has been identified with the modern es-Salt, where the roads from Jericho and from Shechem to Damascus unite, about 25 miles east of the Jordan and 13 south of the Jabbok.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Ramathaim-zophim">
    <description>the two heights of the Zophites or of the watchers (only in 1 Sam. 1:1), "in the land of Zuph" (9:5). Ramathaim is another name for Ramah (4).</description>
    <description>One of the Levitical families descended from Kohath, that of Zuph or Zophai (<reflink target="XXX">1 Chr. 6:26, 35</reflink>), had a district assigned to them in Ephraim, which from this circumstance was called "the land of Zuph," and hence the name of the town, "Zophim." It was the birth-place of Samuel and the seat of his authority (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 2:11; 7:17</reflink>). It is frequently mentioned in the history of that prophet and of David (15:34; 16:13; 19:18-23). Here Samuel died and was buried (25:1).</description>
    <description>This town has been identified with the modern Neby Samwil ("the prophet Samuel"), about 4 or 5 miles north-west of Jerusalem. But there is no certainty as to its precise locality. Some have supposed that it may be identical with Arimathea of the New Testament. (<see target="x-self">See MIZPAH</see>).</description>

  <item id="Ramathite">
    <description>the designation given to Shimei, the manager of David's vineyard (<reflink target="XXX">1 Chr. 27:27</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Rameses">
    <description>"the land of" (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 47:11</reflink>), was probably "the land of Goshen" (q.v.) 45:10. After the Hebrews had built Rameses, one of the "treasure cities," it came to be known as the "land" in which that city was built.</description>
    <description>The city bearing this name (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 12:37</reflink>) was probably identical with Zoan, which Rameses II. ("son of the sun") rebuilt. It became his special residence, and ranked next in importance and magnificance to Thebes. Huge masses of bricks, made of Nile mud, sun-dried, some of them mixed with stubble, possibly moulded by Jewish hands, still mark the site of Rameses. This was the general rendezvous of the Israelites before they began their march out of Egypt. Called also Raamses (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 1:11</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Ramoth">
    <description>heights. A Levitical city in the tribe of Issachar (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 30:27; 1 Chr. 6:73</reflink>), the same as Jarmuth (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 21:29</reflink>) and Remeth (q.v.), 19:21.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Ramoth-gilead">
    <description>heights of Gilead, a city of refuge on the east of Jordan; called "Ramoth in Gilead" (<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 4:43; Josh. 20:8; 21:38</reflink>). Here Ahab, who joined Jehoshaphat in an endeavour to rescue it from the hands of the king of Syria, was mortally wounded (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 22:1-36</reflink>). A similar attempt was afterwards made by Ahaziah and Joram, when the latter was wounded (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 8:28</reflink>). In this city Jehu, the son of Jehoshaphat, was anointed by one of the sons of the prophets (9:1, 4).</description>
    <description>It has with probability been identified with Reimun, on the northern slope of the Jabbok, about 5 miles west of Jerash or Gerasa, one of the cities of Decapolis. Others identify it with Gerosh, about 25 miles north-east of es-Salt, with which also many have identified it. (<see target="x-self">See RAMATH-MIZPEH.</see>)</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Ranges">
    <description>(1.) Lev. 11:35. Probably a cooking furnace for two or more pots, as the Hebrew word here is in the dual number; or perhaps a fire-place fitted to receive a pair of ovens.</description>
    <description>(2.) 2 Kings 11:8. A Hebrew word is here used different from the preceding, meaning "ranks of soldiers." The Levites were appointed to guard the king's person within the temple (<reflink target="XXX">2 Chr. 23:7</reflink>), while the soldiers were his guard in the court, and in going from the temple to the palace. The soldiers are here commanded to slay any one who should break through the "ranks" (as rendered in the R.V.) to come near the king. In 2 Kings 11:15 the expression, "Have her forth without the ranges," is in the Revised Version, "Have her forth between the ranks;" i.e., Jehoiada orders that Athaliah should be kept surrounded by his own guards, and at the same time conveyed beyond the precincts of the temple.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Ransom">
    <description>the price or payment made for our redemption, as when it is said that the Son of man "gave his life a ransom for many" (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 20:28; comp. Acts 20:28; Rom. 3:23, 24; 1 Cor. 6:19, 20; Gal. 3:13; 4:4, 5: Eph. 1:7; Col. 1:14; 1 Tim. 2:6; Titus 2:14; 1 Pet. 1:18, 19. In all these passages the same idea is expressed</reflink>). This word is derived from the Fr. rancon; Lat. redemptio. The debt is represented not as cancelled but as fully paid. The slave or captive is not liberated by a mere gratuitous favour, but a ransom price has been paid, in consideration of which he is set free. The original owner receives back his alienated and lost possession because he has bought it back "with a price." This price or ransom (Gr. lutron) is always said to be Christ, his blood, his death. He secures our redemption by the payment of a ransom. (<see target="x-self">See REDEMPTION.</see>)</description>

  <item id="Raven">
    <description>Heb. 'orebh, from a root meaning "to be black" (<reflink target="XXX">comp. Cant. 5:11</reflink>); first mentioned as "sent forth" by Noah from the ark (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 8:7</reflink>). "Every raven after his kind" was forbidden as food (<reflink target="XXX">Lev. 11:15; Deut. 14:14</reflink>). Ravens feed mostly on carrion, and hence their food is procured with difficulty (<reflink target="XXX">Job 38:41; Ps. 147:9</reflink>). When they attack kids or lambs or weak animals, it is said that they first pick out the eyes of their victims (<reflink target="XXX">Prov. 30:17</reflink>). When Elijah was concealed by the brook Cherith, God commanded the ravens to bring him "bread and flesh in the morning, and bread and flesh in the evening" (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 17:3-6</reflink>). (<see target="x-self">See ELIJAH.</see>)</description>

    <description>a noose, the daughter of Bethuel, and the wife of Isaac (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 22:23; 24:67</reflink>). The circumstances under which Abraham's "steward" found her at the "city of Nahor," in Padan-aram, are narrated in Gen. 24-27. "She can hardly be regarded as an amiable woman. When we first see her she is ready to leave her father's house for ever at an hour's notice; and her future life showed not only a full share of her brother Laban's duplicity, but the grave fault of partiality in her relations to her children, and a strong will, which soon controlled the gentler nature of her husband." The time and circumstances of her death are not recorded, but it is said that she was buried in the cave of Machpelah (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 49:31</reflink>).</description>

  </item>
  <item id="Rechabites">
    <description>the descendants of Rechab through Jonadab or Jehonadab. They belonged to the Kenites, who accompanied the children of Israel into Palestine, and dwelt among them. Moses married a Kenite wife (<reflink target="XXX">Judg. 1:16</reflink>), and Jael was the wife of "Heber the Kenite" (4:17). Saul also showed kindness to the Kenites (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 15:6</reflink>). The main body of the Kenites dwelt in cities, and adopted settled habits of life (30:29); but Jehonadab forbade his descendants to drink wine or to live in cities. They were commanded to lead always a nomad life. They adhered to the law laid down by Jonadab, and were noted for their fidelity to the old-established custom of their family in the days of Jeremiah (35); and this feature of their character is referred to by the prophet for the purpose of giving point to his own exhortation. They are referred to in Neh. 3:14 and 1 Chr. 2:55. Dr. Wolff (1839) found in Arabia, near Mecca, a tribe claiming to be descendants of Jehonadab; and recently a Bedouin tribe has been found near the Dead Sea who also profess to be descendants of the same Kenite chief.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Reconcilation">
    <description>a change from enmity to friendship. It is mutual, i.e., it is a change wrought in both parties who have been at enmity.</description>
    <description>(1.) In Col. 1:21, 22, the word there used refers to a change wrought in the personal character of the sinner who ceases to be an enemy to God by wicked works, and yields up to him his full confidence and love. In 2 Cor. 5:20 the apostle beseeches the Corinthians to be "reconciled to God", i.e., to lay aside their enmity.</description>
    <description>(2.) Rom. 5:10 refers not to any change in our disposition toward God, but to God himself, as the party reconciled. Romans 5:11 teaches the same truth. From God we have received "the reconciliation" (R.V.), i.e., he has conferred on us the token of his friendship. So also 2 Cor. 5:18, 19 speaks of a reconciliation originating with God, and consisting in the removal of his merited wrath. In Eph. 2:16 it is clear that the apostle does not refer to the winning back of the sinner in love and loyalty to God, but to the restoration of God's forfeited favour. This is effected by his justice being satisfied, so that he can, in consistency with his own nature, be favourable toward sinners. Justice demands the punishment of sinners. The death of Christ satisfies justice, and so reconciles God to us. This reconciliation makes God our friend, and enables him to pardon and save us.

  <item id="Recorder">
    <description>(Heb. mazkir, i.e., "the mentioner," "rememberancer"), the office first held by Jehoshaphat in the court of David (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 8:16</reflink>), also in the court of Solomon (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 4:3</reflink>). The next recorder mentioned is Joah, in the reign of Hezekiah (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 18:18, 37; Isa. 36:3, 22</reflink>). In the reign of Josiah another of the name of Joah filled this office (<reflink target="XXX">2 Chr. 34:8</reflink>). The "recorder" was the chancellor or vizier of the kingdom. He brought all weighty matters under the notice of the king, "such as complaints, petitions, and wishes of subjects or foreigners. He also drew up papers for the king's guidance, and prepared drafts of the royal will for the scribes. All treaties came under his oversight; and he had the care of the national archives or records, to which, as royal historiographer, like the same state officer in Assyria and Egypt, he added the current annals of the kingdom."</description>

  <item id="Red Sea">
    <description>The sea so called extends along the west coast of Arabia for about 1,400 miles, and separates Asia from Africa. It is connected with the Indian Ocean, of which it is an arm, by the Strait of Bab-el-Mandeb. At a point (Ras Mohammed) about 200 miles from its nothern extremity it is divided into two arms, that on the east called the AElanitic Gulf, now the Bahr el-'Akabah, about 100 miles long by 15 broad, and that on the west the Gulf of Suez, about 150 miles long by about 20 broad. This branch is now connected with the Mediterranean by the Suez Canal. Between these two arms lies the Sinaitic Peninsula.</description>
    <description>The Hebrew name generally given to this sea is _Yam Suph_. This word _suph_ means a woolly kind of sea-weed, which the sea casts up in great abundance on its shores. In these passages, Ex. 10:19; 13:18; 15:4, 22; 23:31; Num. 14:25, etc., the Hebrew name is always translated "Red Sea," which was the name given to it by the Greeks. The origin of this name (Red Sea) is uncertain. Some think it is derived from the red colour of the mountains on the western shore; others from the red coral found in the sea, or the red appearance sometimes given to the water by certain zoophytes floating in it. In the New Testament (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 7:36; Heb. 11:29</reflink>) this name is given to the Gulf of Suez.</description>
    <description>This sea was also called by the Hebrews Yam-mitstraim, i.e., "the Egyptian sea" (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 11:15</reflink>), and simply Ha-yam, "the sea" (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 14:2, 9, 16, 21, 28; Josh. 24:6, 7; Isa. 10:26, etc.</reflink>).</description>
    <description>The great historical event connected with the Red Sea is the passage of the children of Israel, and the overthrow of the Egyptians, to which there is frequent reference in Scripture (Ex. 14, 15; Num. 33:8; Deut. 11:4; Josh. 2:10; Judg. 11:16; 2 Sam. 22:16; Neh. 9:9-11; Ps. 66:6; Isa. 10:26; Acts 7:36, etc.).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Red Sea, Passage of">
    <description>The account of the march of the Israelites through the Red Sea is given in Ex. 14:22-31. There has been great diversity of opinion as to the precise place where this occurred. The difficulty of arriving at any definite conclusion on the matter is much increased by the consideration that the head of the Gulf of Suez, which was the branch of the sea that was crossed, must have extended at the time of the Exodus probably 50 miles farther north than it does at present. Some have argued that the crossing took place opposite the Wady Tawarik, where the sea is at present some 7 miles broad. But the opinion that seems to be best supported is that which points to the neighbourhood of Suez. This position perfectly satisfies all the conditions of the stupendous miracle as recorded in the sacred narrative. (<see target="x-self">See EXODUS.</see>)</description>

  <item id="Redeemer">
    <description>Heb. goel; i.e., one charged with the duty of restoring the rights of another and avenging his wrongs (<reflink target="XXX">Lev. 25:48, 49; Num. 5:8; Ruth 4:1; Job 19:25; Ps. 19:14; 78:35, etc.</reflink>). This title is peculiarly applied to Christ. He redeems us from all evil by the payment of a ransom (q.v.). (<see target="x-self">See REDEMPTION.</see>)</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Redemption">
    <description>the purchase back of something that had been lost, by the payment of a ransom. The Greek word so rendered is _apolutrosis_, a word occurring nine times in Scripture, and always with the idea of a ransom or price paid, i.e., redemption by a lutron (<reflink target="XXX">see Matt. 20:28; Mark 10:45</reflink>). There are instances in the LXX. Version of the Old Testament of the use of _lutron_ in man's relation to man (<reflink target="XXX">Lev. 19:20; 25:51; Ex. 21:30; Num. 35:31, 32; Isa. 45:13; Prov. 6:35</reflink>), and in the same sense of man's relation to God (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 3:49; 18:15</reflink>).</description>
    <description>There are many passages in the New Testament which represent Christ's sufferings under the idea of a ransom or price, and the result thereby secured is a purchase or redemption (<reflink target="XXX">comp. Acts 20:28; 1 Cor. 6:19, 20; Gal. 3:13; 4:4, 5; Eph. 1:7; Col. 1:14; 1 Tim. 2:5, 6; Titus 2:14; Heb. 9:12; 1 Pet. 1:18, 19; Rev. 5:9</reflink>). The idea running through all these texts, however various their reference, is that of payment made for our redemption. The debt against us is not viewed as simply cancelled, but is fully paid. Christ's blood or life, which he surrendered for them, is the "ransom" by which the deliverance of his people from the servitude of sin and from its penal consequences is secured. It is the plain doctrine of Scripture that "Christ saves us neither by the mere exercise of power, nor by his doctrine, nor by his example, nor by the moral influence which he exerted, nor by any subjective influence on his people, whether natural or mystical, but as a satisfaction to divine justice, as an expiation for sin, and as a ransom from the curse and authority of the law, thus reconciling us to God by making it consistent with his perfection to exercise mercy toward sinners" (Hodge's Systematic Theology).</description>

    <description>(2.) Heb. kaneh (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 14:15; Job 40:21; Isa. 19:6</reflink>), whence the Gr. kanna, a "cane," a generic name for a reed of any kind.</description>
    <description>The reed of Egypt and Palestine is the Arundo donax, which grows to the height of 12 feet, its stalk jointed like the bamboo, "with a magnificent panicle of blossom at the top, and so slender and yielding that it will lie perfectly flat under a gust of wind, and immediately resume its upright position." It is used to illustrate weakness (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 18:21; Ezek. 29:6</reflink>), also fickleness or instability (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 11:7; comp. Eph. 4:14</reflink>).</description>
    <description>A "bruised reed" (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 42:3; Matt. 12:20</reflink>) is an emblem of a believer weak in grace. A reed was put into our Lord's hands in derision (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 27:29</reflink>); and "they took the reed and smote him on the head" (30). The "reed" on which they put the sponge filled with vinegar (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 27:48</reflink>) was, according to John (19:29), a hyssop stalk, which must have been of some length, or perhaps a bunch of hyssop twigs fastened to a rod with the sponge.

  <item id="Regeneration">
    <description>only found in Matt. 19:28 and Titus 3:5. This word literally means a "new birth." The Greek word so rendered (palingenesia) is used by classical writers with reference to the changes produced by the return of spring. In Matt. 19:28 the word is equivalent to the "restitution of all things" (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 3:21</reflink>). In Titus 3:5 it denotes that change of heart elsewhere spoken of as a passing from death to life (<reflink target="XXX">1 John 3:14</reflink>); becoming a new creature in Christ Jesus (<reflink target="XXX">2 Cor. 5:17</reflink>); being born again (<reflink target="XXX">John 3:5</reflink>); a renewal of the mind (<reflink target="XXX">Rom. 12:2</reflink>); a resurrection from the dead (<reflink target="XXX">Eph. 2:6</reflink>); a being quickened (2:1, 5).</description>
    <description>This change is ascribed to the Holy Spirit. It originates not with man but with God (<reflink target="XXX">John 1:12, 13; 1 John 2:29; 5:1, 4</reflink>).</description>
    <description>As to the nature of the change, it consists in the implanting of a new principle or disposition in the soul; the impartation of spiritual life to those who are by nature "dead in trespasses and sins."</description>
    <description>The necessity of such a change is emphatically affirmed in Scripture (<reflink target="XXX">John 3:3; Rom. 7:18; 8:7-9; 1 Cor. 2:14; Eph. 2:1; 4:21-24</reflink>).</description>

    <description>he enlarges the people, the successor of Solomon on the throne, and apparently his only son. He was the son of Naamah "the Ammonitess," some well-known Ammonitish princess (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 14:21; 2 Chr. 12:13</reflink>). He was forty-one years old when he ascended the throne, and he reigned seventeen years (B.C. 975-958). Although he was acknowledged at once as the rightful heir to the throne, yet there was a strongly-felt desire to modify the character of the government. The burden of taxation to which they had been subjected during Solomon's reign was very oppressive, and therefore the people assembled at Shechem and demanded from the king an alleviation of their burdens. He went to meet them at Shechem, and heard their demands for relief (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 12:4</reflink>). After three days, having consulted with a younger generation of courtiers that had grown up around him, instead of following the advice of elders, he answered the people haughtily (6-15). "The king hearkened not unto the people; for the cause was from the Lord" (<reflink target="XXX">comp. 11:31</reflink>). This brought matters speedily to a crisis. The terrible cry was heard (comp. 2 Sam. 20:1):</description>
    <description>"What portion have we in David? Neither have we inheritance in the son of Jesse: To your tents, O Israel: Now see to thine own house, David" (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 12:16</reflink>).</description>
    <description>And now at once the kingdom was rent in twain. Rehoboam was appalled, and tried concessions, but it was too late (18). The tribe of Judah, Rehoboam's own tribe, alone remained faithful to him. Benjamin was reckoned along with Judah, and these two tribes formed the southern kingdom, with Jerusalem as its capital; while the northern ten tribes formed themselves into a separate kingdom, choosing Jeroboam as their king. Rehoboam tried to win back the revolted ten tribes by making war against them, but he was prevented by the prophet Shemaiah (21-24; 2 Chr. 11:1-4) from fulfilling his purpose. (See JEROBOAM</description>
    <description>In the fifth year of Rehoboam's reign, Shishak (q.v.), one of the kings of Egypt of the Assyrian dynasty, stirred up, no doubt, by Jeroboam his son-in-law, made war against him. Jerusalem submitted to the invader, who plundered the temple and virtually reduced the kingdom to the position of a vassal of Egypt (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 14:25, 26; 2 Chr. 12:5-9</reflink>). A remarkable memorial of this invasion has been discovered at Karnac, in Upper Egypt, in certain sculptures on the walls of a small temple there. These sculptures represent the king, Shishak, holding in his hand a train of prisoners and other figures, with the names of the captured towns of Judah, the towns which Rehoboam had fortified (<reflink target="XXX">2 Chr. 11:5-12</reflink>).</description>
    <description>The kingdom of Judah, under Rehoboam, sank more and more in moral and spiritual decay. "There was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all their days." At length, in the fifty-eighth year of his age, Rehoboam "slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David" (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 14:31</reflink>). He was succeeded by his son Abijah. (<see target="x-self">See EGYPT.</see>)</description>

  </item>
  <item id="Repentance">
    <description>There are three Greek words used in the New Testament to denote repentance. (1.) The verb _metamelomai_ is used of a change of mind, such as to produce regret or even remorse on account of sin, but not necessarily a change of heart. This word is used with reference to the repentance of Judas (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 27:3</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(2.) Metanoeo, meaning to change one's mind and purpose, as the result of after knowledge. This verb, with (3) the cognate noun _metanoia_, is used of true repentance, a change of mind and purpose and life, to which remission of sin is promised.</description>
    <description>Evangelical repentance consists of (1) a true sense of one's own guilt and sinfulness; (2) an apprehension of God's mercy in Christ; (3) an actual hatred of sin (<reflink target="XXX">Ps. 119:128; Job 42:5, 6; 2 Cor. 7:10</reflink>) and turning from it to God; and (4) a persistent endeavour after a holy life in a walking with God in the way of his commandments.</description>
    <description>The true penitent is conscious of guilt (<reflink target="XXX">Ps. 51:4, 9</reflink>), of pollution (51:5, 7, 10), and of helplessness (51:11; 109:21, 22). Thus he apprehends himself to be just what God has always seen him to be and declares him to be. But repentance comprehends not only such a sense of sin, but also an apprehension of mercy, without which there can be no true repentance (<reflink target="XXX">Ps. 51:1; 130:4</reflink>).</description>

  <item id="Rephael">

  <item id="Rephaim">

The aborigines of Palestine, afterwards conquered and dispossessed by the Canaanite tribes, are classed under this general title. They were known to the Moabites as Emim, i.e., "fearful", (<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 2:11</reflink>), and to the Ammonites as Zamzummim. Some of them found refuge among the Philistines, and were still existing in the days of David. We know nothing of their origin. They were not necessarily connected with the "giants" (R.V., "Nephilim") of Gen. 6:4. (<see target="x-self">See GIANTS.</see>)</description>

  <item id="Rephaim, Valley of">
    <description>(<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 15:8; 18:16, R.V.</reflink>). When David became king over all Israel, the Philistines, judging that he would now become their uncompromising enemy, made a sudden attack upon Hebron, compelling David to retire from it. He sought refuge in "the hold" at Adullam (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 5:17-22</reflink>), and the Philistines took up their position in the valley of Rephaim, on the west and south-west of Jerusalem. Thus all communication between Bethlehem and Jerusalem was intercepted. While David and his army were encamped here, there occurred that incident narrated in 2 Sam. 23:15-17. Having obtained divine direction, David led his army against the Philistines, and gained a complete victory over them. The scene of this victory was afterwards called Baalperazim (q.v.).</description>
    <description>A second time, however, the Philistines rallied their forces in this valley (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 5:22</reflink>). Again warned by a divine oracle, David led his army to Gibeon, and attacked the Philistines from the south, inflicting on them another severe defeat, and chasing them with great slaughter to Gezer (q.v.). There David kept in check these enemies of Israel. This valley is now called el-Bukei'a.</description>

  <item id="Rephidim">
    <description>supports, one of the stations of the Israelites, situated in the Wady Feiran, near its junction with the Wady esh-Sheikh. Here no water could be found for the people to drink, and in their impatience they were ready to stone Moses, as if he were the cause of their distress. At the command of God Moses smote "the rock in Horeb," and a copious stream flowed forth, enough for all the people. After this the Amalekites attacked the Israelites while they were here encamped, but they were utterly defeated (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 17:1, 8-16</reflink>). They were the "first of the nations" to make war against Israel (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 24:20</reflink>).</description>
    <description>Leaving Rephidim, the Israelites advanced into the wilderness of Sinai (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 19:1, 2; Num. 33:14, 15</reflink>), marching probably through the two passes of the Wady Solaf and the Wady esh-Sheikh, which converge at the entrance to the plain er-Rahah, the "desert of Sinai," which is two miles long and about half a mile broad.

    <description>(4.) Gr. sabbatismos, a Sabbath rest, a rest from all work (<reflink target="XXX">Heb. 4:9; R.V., "sabbath"</reflink>), a rest like that of God when he had finished the work of creation.</description>

  <item id="Resurrection of Christ">
    <description>one of the cardinal facts and doctrines of the gospel. If Christ be not risen, our faith is vain (<reflink target="XXX">1 Cor. 15:14</reflink>). The whole of the New Testament revelation rests on this as an historical fact. On the day of Pentecost Peter argued the necessity of Christ's resurrection from the prediction in Ps. 16 (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 2:24-28</reflink>). In his own discourses, also, our Lord clearly intimates his resurrection (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 20:19; Mark 9:9; 14:28; Luke 18:33; John 2:19-22</reflink>).</description>
    <description>The evangelists give circumstantial accounts of the facts connected with that event, and the apostles, also, in their public teaching largely insist upon it. Ten different appearances of our risen Lord are recorded in the New Testament. They may be arranged as follows:</description>
    <description>(1.) To Mary Magdalene at the sepulchre alone. This is recorded at length only by John (20:11-18), and alluded to by Mark (16:9-11).</description>
    <description>(2.) To certain women, "the other Mary," Salome, Joanna, and others, as they returned from the sepulchre. Matthew (28:1-10) alone gives an account of this. (<reflink target="XXX">Comp. Mark 16:1-8, and Luke 24:1-11.</reflink>)</description>
    <description>(3.) To Simon Peter alone on the day of the resurrection. (<reflink target="XXX">See Luke 24:34; 1 Cor. 15:5.</reflink>)</description>
    <description>(4.) To the two disciples on the way to Emmaus on the day of the resurrection, recorded fully only by Luke (24:13-35. Comp. Mark 16:12, 13).</description>
    <description>(5.) To the ten disciples (Thomas being absent) and others "with them," at Jerusalem on the evening of the resurrection day. One of the evangelists gives an account of this appearance, John (20:19-24).</description>
    <description>(6.) To the disciples again (Thomas being present) at Jerusalem (<reflink target="XXX">Mark 16:14-18; Luke 24:33-40; John 20:26-28. See also 1 Cor. 15:5</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(7.) To the disciples when fishing at the Sea of Galilee. Of this appearance also John (21:1-23) alone gives an account.</description>
    <description>(8.) To the eleven, and above 500 brethren at once, at an appointed place in Galilee (<reflink target="XXX">1 Cor. 15:6; comp. Matt. 28:16-20</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(9.) To James, but under what circumstances we are not informed (<reflink target="XXX">1 Cor. 15:7</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(10.) To the apostles immediately before the ascension. They accompanied him from Jerusalem to Mount Olivet, and there they saw him ascend "till a cloud received him out of their sight" (<reflink target="XXX">Mark 16:19; Luke 24:50-52; Acts 1:4-10</reflink>).</description>
    <description>It is worthy of note that it is distinctly related that on most of these occasions our Lord afforded his disciples the amplest opportunity of testing the fact of his resurrection. He conversed with them face to face. They touched him (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 28:9; Luke 24:39; John 20:27</reflink>), and he ate bread with them (<reflink target="XXX">Luke 24:42, 43; John 21:12, 13</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(11.) In addition to the above, mention might be made of Christ's manifestation of himself to Paul at Damascus, who speaks of it as an appearance of the risen Saviour (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 9:3-9, 17; 1 Cor. 15:8; 9:1</reflink>).</description>
    <description>It is implied in the words of Luke (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 1:3</reflink>) that there may have been other appearances of which we have no record.</description>
    <description>The resurrection is spoken of as the act (1) of God the Father (<reflink target="XXX">Ps. 16:10; Acts 2:24; 3:15; Rom. 8:11; Eph. 1:20; Col. 2:12; Heb. 13:20</reflink>); (2) of Christ himself (<reflink target="XXX">John 2:19; 10:18</reflink>); and (3) of the Holy Spirit (<reflink target="XXX">1 Peter 3:18</reflink>).</description>
    <description>The resurrection is a public testimony of Christ's release from his undertaking as surety, and an evidence of the Father's acceptance of his work of redemption. It is a victory over death and the grave for all his followers.</description>
    <description>The importance of Christ's resurrection will be seen when we consider that if he rose the gospel is true, and if he rose not it is false. His resurrection from the dead makes it manifest that his sacrifice was accepted. Our justification was secured by his obedience to the death, and therefore he was raised from the dead (<reflink target="XXX">Rom. 4:25</reflink>). His resurrection is a proof that he made a full atonement for our sins, that his sacrifice was accepted as a satisfaction to divine justice, and his blood a ransom for sinners. It is also a pledge and an earnest of the resurrection of all believers (<reflink target="XXX">Rom. 8:11; 1 Cor. 6:14; 15:47-49; Phil. 3:21; 1 John 3:2</reflink>). As he lives, they shall live also.</description>
    <description>It proved him to be the Son of God, inasmuch as it authenticated all his claims (<reflink target="XXX">John 2:19; 10:17</reflink>). "If Christ did not rise, the whole scheme of redemption is a failure, and all the predictions and anticipations of its glorious results for time and for eternity, for men and for angels of every rank and order, are proved to be chimeras. 'But now is Christ risen from the dead, and become the first-fruits of them that slept.' Therefore the Bible is true from Genesis to Revelation. The kingdom of darkness has been overthrown, Satan has fallen as lightning from heaven, and the triumph of truth over error, of good over evil, of happiness over misery is for ever secured." Hodge.</description>
    <description>With reference to the report which the Roman soldiers were bribed (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 28:12-14</reflink>) to circulate concerning Christ's resurrection, "his disciples came by night and stole him away while we slept," Matthew Henry in his "Commentary," under John 20:1-10, fittingly remarks, "The grave-clothes in which Christ had been buried were found in very good order, which serves for an evidence that his body was not 'stolen away while men slept.' Robbers of tombs have been known to take away 'the clothes' and leave the body; but none ever took away 'the body' and left the clothes, especially when they were 'fine linen' and new (<reflink target="XXX">Mark 15:46</reflink>). Any one would rather choose to carry a dead body in its clothes than naked. Or if they that were supposed to have stolen it would have left the grave-clothes behind, yet it cannot be supposed they would find leisure to 'fold up the linen.'"</description>

The qualities of the resurrection body will be different from those of the body laid in the grave (<reflink target="XXX">1 Cor. 15:53, 54; Phil. 3:21</reflink>); but its identity will nevertheless be preserved. It will still be the same body (<reflink target="XXX">1 Cor. 15:42-44</reflink>) which rises again.</description>
    <description>As to the nature of the resurrection body, (1) it will be spiritual (<reflink target="XXX">1 Cor. 15:44</reflink>), i.e., a body adapted to the use of the soul in its glorified state, and to all the conditions of the heavenly state; (2) glorious, incorruptible, and powerful (54); (3) like unto the glorified body of Christ (<reflink target="XXX">Phil. 3:21</reflink>); and (4) immortal (<reflink target="XXX">Rev. 21:4</reflink>).</description>
    <description>Christ's resurrection secures and illustrates that of his people. "(1.) Because his resurrection seals and consummates his redemptive power; and the redemption of our persons involves the redemption of our bodies (<reflink target="XXX">Rom. 8:23</reflink>). (2.) Because of our federal and vital union with Christ (<reflink target="XXX">1 Cor. 15:21, 22; 1 Thess. 4:14</reflink>). (3.) Because of his Spirit which dwells in us making our bodies his members (<reflink target="XXX">1 Cor. 6:15; Rom. 8:11</reflink>). (4.) Because Christ by covenant is Lord both of the living and the dead (<reflink target="XXX">Rom. 14:9</reflink>). This same federal and vital union of the Christian with Christ likewise causes the resurrection of the believer to be similar to as well as consequent upon that of Christ (<reflink target="XXX">1 Cor. 15:49; Phil. 3:21; 1 John 3:2</reflink>)."

    <description>behold a son!, the eldest son of Jacob and Leah (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 29:32</reflink>). His sinful conduct, referred to in Gen. 35:22, brought down upon him his dying father's malediction (48:4). He showed kindness to Joseph, and was the means of saving his life when his other brothers would have put him to death (37:21,22). It was he also who pledged his life and the life of his sons when Jacob was unwilling to let Benjamin go down into Egypt. After Jacob and his family went down into Egypt (46:8) no further mention is made of Reuben beyond what is recorded in ch. 49:3,4.</description>

  <item id="Reuben, Tribe of">
    <description>at the Exodus numbered 46,500 male adults, from twenty years old and upwards (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 1:20, 21</reflink>), and at the close of the wilderness wanderings they numbered only 43,730 (26:7). This tribe united with that of Gad in asking permission to settle in the "land of Gilead," "on the other side of Jordan" (32:1-5). The lot assigned to Reuben was the smallest of the lots given to the trans-Jordanic tribes. It extended from the Arnon, in the south along the coast of the Dead Sea to its northern end, where the Jordan flows into it (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 13:15-21, 23</reflink>). It thus embraced the original kingdom of Sihon. Reuben is "to the eastern tribes what Simeon is to the western. 'Unstable as water,' he vanishes away into a mere Arabian tribe. 'His men are few;' it is all he can do 'to live and not die.' We hear of nothing beyond the multiplication of their cattle in the land of Gilead, their spoils of 'camels fifty thousand, and of asses two thousand' (<reflink target="XXX">1 Chr. 5:9, 10, 20, 21</reflink>). In the great struggles of the nation he never took part. The complaint against him in the song of Deborah is the summary of his whole history. 'By the streams of Reuben,' i.e., by the fresh streams which descend from the eastern hills into the Jordan and the Dead Sea, on whose banks the Bedouin chiefs met then as now to debate, in the 'streams' of Reuben great were the 'desires'", i.e., resolutions which were never carried out, the people idly resting among their flocks as if it were a time of peace (<reflink target="XXX">Judg. 5:15, 16</reflink>).

    <description>All the three tribes on the east of Jordan at length fell into complete apostasy, and the time of retribution came.

  <item id="Revelation">
    <description>an uncovering, a bringing to light of that which had been previously wholly hidden or only obscurely seen. God has been pleased in various ways and at different times (<reflink target="XXX">Heb. 1:1</reflink>) to make a supernatural revelation of himself and his purposes and plans, which, under the guidance of his Spirit, has been committed to writing. (<see target="x-self">See WORD OF GOD.</see>) The Scriptures are not merely the "record" of revelation; they are the revelation itself in a written form, in order to the accurate presevation and propagation of the truth.</description>
    <description>Revelation and inspiration differ. Revelation is the supernatural communication of truth to the mind; inspiration (q.v.) secures to the teacher or writer infallibility in communicating that truth to others. It renders its subject the spokesman or prophet of God in such a sense that everything he asserts to be true, whether fact or doctrine or moral principle, is true, infallibly true.</description>

  <item id="Revelation of Christ">
    <description>the second advent of Christ. Three different Greek words are used by the apostles to express this, (1) apokalupsis (1 Cor. 1;7; 2 Thess. 1:7; 1 Pet. 1:7, 13); (2) parousia (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 24:3, 27; 1 Thess. 2:19; James 5:7, 8</reflink>); (3) epiphaneia (<reflink target="XXX">1 Tim. 6:14; 2 Tim. 1:10; 4:1-8; Titus 2:13</reflink>).

  </item>
  <item id="Revelation, Book of">
    <description>=The Apocalypse, the closing book and the only prophetical book of the New Testament canon. The author of this book was undoubtedly John the apostle. His name occurs four times in the book itself (1:1, 4, 9; 22:8), and there is every reason to conclude that the "John" here mentioned was the apostle. In a manuscript of about the twelfth century he is called "John the divine," but no reason can be assigned for this appellation.</description>
    <description>The date of the writing of this book has generally been fixed at A.D. 96, in the reign of Domitian. There are some, however, who contend for an earlier date, A.D. 68 or 69, in the reign of Nero. Those who are in favour of the later date appeal to the testimony of the Christian father Irenaeus, who received information relative to this book from those who had seen John face to face. He says that the Apocalypse "was seen no long time ago."</description>
    <description>As to the relation between this book and the Gospel of John, it has been well observed that "the leading ideas of both are the same. The one gives us in a magnificent vision, the other in a great historic drama, the supreme conflict between good and evil and its issue. In both Jesus Christ is the central figure, whose victory through defeat is the issue of the conflict. In both the Jewish dispensation is the preparation for the gospel, and the warfare and triumph of the Christ is described in language saturated with the Old Testament. The difference of date will go a long way toward explaining the difference of style." Plummer's Gospel of St. John, Introd.</description>

Ahaz induced Tiglath-pileser III. to attack Damascus, and this caused Rezin to withdraw for the purpose of defending his own kingdom.

    <description>These winter torrents sometimes come down with great suddenness and with desolating force. A distinguished traveller thus describes his experience in this matter:, "I was encamped in Wady Feiran, near the base of Jebel Serbal, when a tremendous thunderstorm burst upon us. After little more than an hour's rain, the water rose so rapidly in the previously dry wady that I had to run for my life, and with great difficulty succeeded in saving my tent and goods; my boots, which I had not time to pick up, were washed away. In less than two hours a dry desert wady upwards of 300 yards broad was turned into a foaming torrent from 8 to 10 feet deep, roaring and tearing down and bearing everything upon it, tangled masses of tamarisks, hundreds of beautiful palmtrees, scores of sheep and goats, camels and donkeys, and even men, women, and children, for a whole encampment of Arabs was washed away a few miles above me. The storm commenced at five in the evening; at half-past nine the waters were rapidly subsiding, and it was evident that the flood had spent its force." (<reflink target="XXX">Comp.

    <description>It happened that a grievous famine, which lasted for three years, fell upon the land during the earlier half of David's reign at Jerusalem. This calamity was sent "for Saul and for his bloody house, because he slew the Gibeonites." David inquired of the Gibeonites what satisfaction they demanded, and was answered that nothing would compensate for the wrong Saul had done to them but the death of seven of Saul's sons. David accordingly delivered up to them the two sons of Rizpah and five of the sons of Merab (q.v.), Saul's eldest daughter, whom she bore to Adriel. These the Gibeonites put to death, and hung up their bodies before the Lord at the sanctuary at Gibeah. Rizpah thereupon took her place on the rock of Gibeah (q.v.), and for five months watched the suspended bodies of her children, to prevent them from being devoured by the beasts and birds of prey, till they were at length taken down and buried by David.</description>

The words of the Authorized Version, "counted it not robbery to be equal," etc. (<reflink target="XXX">Phil. 2:6, 7</reflink>), are better rendered in the Revised Version, "counted it not a prize to be on an equality," etc., i.e., "did not look upon equality with God as a prize which must not slip from his grasp" = "did not cling with avidity to the prerogatives of his divine majesty; did not ambitiously display his equality with God."</description>
    <description>"Robbers of churches" should be rendered, as in the Revised Version, "of temples."

In Dan. 2:45 the Chaldaic form of the Hebrew word is translated "mountain." It ought to be translated "rock," as in Hab. 1:12 in the Revised Version.

"Rolls" (Chald. pl. of sephar, corresponding to Heb. sepher) in Ezra 6:1 is rendered in the Revised Version "archives." In the New Testament the word "volume" (<reflink target="XXX">Heb. 10:7; R.V., "roll"</reflink>) occurs as the rendering of the Greek kephalis, meaning the head or top of the stick or cylinder on which the manuscript was rolled, and hence the manuscript itself.

    <description>This epistle was probably written at Corinth.

    <description>The precise time at which it was written is not mentioned in the epistle, but it was obviously written when the apostle was about to "go unto Jerusalem to minister unto the saints", i.e., at the close of his second visit to Greece, during the winter preceding his last visit to that city (<reflink target="XXX">Rom. 15:25; comp.

    <description>It is highly probable that Christianity was planted in Rome by some of those who had been at Jerusalem on the day of Pentecost (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 2:10</reflink>). At this time the Jews were very numerous in Rome, and their synagogues were probably resorted to by Romans also, who in this way became acquainted with the great facts regarding Jesus as these were reported among the Jews. Thus a church composed of both Jews and Gentiles was formed at Rome. Many of the brethren went out to meet Paul on his approach to Rome. There are evidences that Christians were then in Rome in considerable numbers, and had probably more than one place of meeting (<reflink target="XXX">Rom. 16:14, 15</reflink>).</description>
    <description>The object of the apostle in writing to this church was to explain to them the great doctrines of the gospel. His epistle was a "word in season." Himself deeply impressed with a sense of the value of the doctrines of salvation, he opens up in a clear and connected form the whole system of the gospel in its relation both to Jew and Gentile. This epistle is peculiar in this, that it is a systematic exposition of the gospel of universal application. The subject is here treated argumentatively, and is a plea for Gentiles addressed to Jews. In the Epistle to the Galatians, the same subject is discussed, but there the apostle pleads his own authority, because the church in Galatia had been founded by him.</description>
    <description>After the introduction (1:1-15), the apostle presents in it divers aspects and relations the doctrine of justification by faith (1:16-11:36) on the ground of the imputed righteousness of Christ. He shows that salvation is all of grace, and only of grace. This main section of his letter is followed by various practical exhortations (12:1-15:13), which are followed by a conclusion containing personal explanations and salutations, which contain the names of twenty-four Christians at Rome, a benediction, and a doxology (<reflink target="XXX">Rom. 15:14-ch. 16</reflink>).</description>

  <item id="Rome">
    <description>the most celebrated city in the world at the time of Christ. It is said to have been founded B.C. 753. When the New Testament was written, Rome was enriched and adorned with the spoils of the world, and contained a population estimated at 1,200,000, of which the half were slaves, and including representatives of nearly every nation then known. It was distinguished for its wealth and luxury and profligacy. The empire of which it was the capital had then reached its greatest prosperity.</description>
    <description>On the day of Pentecost there were in Jerusalem "strangers from Rome," who doubtless carried with them back to Rome tidings of that great day, and were instrumental in founding the church there. Paul was brought to this city a prisoner, where he remained for two years (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 28:30, 31</reflink>) "in his own hired house." While here, Paul wrote his epistles to the Philippians, to the Ephesians, to the Colossians, to Philemon, and probably also to the Hebrews. He had during these years for companions Luke and Aristarchus (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 27:2</reflink>), Timothy (<reflink target="XXX">Phil. 1:1; Col. 1:1</reflink>), Tychicus (<reflink target="XXX">Eph. 6: 21</reflink>), Epaphroditus (<reflink target="XXX">Phil. 4:18</reflink>), and John Mark (<reflink target="XXX">Col. 4:10</reflink>). (<see target="x-self">See PAUL.</see>)</description>
    <description>Beneath this city are extensive galleries, called "catacombs," which were used from about the time of the apostles (one of the inscriptions found in them bears the date A.D. 71) for some three hundred years as places of refuge in the time of persecution, and also of worship and burial. About four thousand inscriptions have been found in the catacombs. These give an interesting insight into the history of the church at Rome down to the time of Constantine.</description>

  <item id="Rose">
    <description>Many varieties of the rose proper are indigenous to Syria. The famed rose of Damascus is white, but there are also red and yellow roses. In Cant. 2:1 and Isa. 35:1 the Hebrew word _habatstseleth_ (found only in these passages), rendered "rose" (R.V. marg., "autumn crocus"), is supposed by some to mean the oleander, by others the sweet-scented narcissus (a native of Palestine), the tulip, or the daisy; but nothing definite can be affirmed regarding it.</description>
    <description>The "rose of Sharon" is probably the cistus or rock-rose, several species of which abound in Palestine. "Mount Carmel especially abounds in the cistus, which in April covers some of the barer parts of the mountain with a glow not inferior to that of the Scottish heather." (<see target="x-self">See MYRRH [2].</see>)</description>

  <item id="Rosh">
    <description>(<reflink target="XXX">Ezek. 38:2, 3; 39:1</reflink>) is rendered "chief" in the Authorized Version. It is left untranslated as a proper name in the Revised Version. Some have supposed that the Russians are here meant, as one of the three Scythian tribes of whom Magog was the prince. They invaded the land of Judah in the days of Josiah. Herodotus, the Greek historian, says: "For twenty-eight years the Scythians ruled over Asia, and things were turned upside down by their violence and contempt." (<see target="x-self">See BETHSHEAN.</see>)</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Rosin">
    <description>found only in Authorized Version, margin, Ezek. 27:17, Heb. tsori, uniformly rendered elsewhere "balm" (q.v.), as here in the text. The Vulgate has resinam, rendered "rosin" in the Douay Version. As used, however, by Jerome, the Lat. resina denotes some odoriferous gum or oil.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Ruby">
    <description>(Heb. peninim), only in plural (<reflink target="XXX">Lam. 4:7</reflink>). The ruby was one of the stones in the high priest's breastplate (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 28:17</reflink>). A comparison is made between the value of wisdom and rubies (<reflink target="XXX">Job 28:18; Prov. 3:15; 8:11</reflink>). The price of a virtuous woman is said to be "far above rubies" (<reflink target="XXX">Prov. 31:10</reflink>). The exact meaning of the Hebrew word is uncertain. Some render it "red coral;" others, "pearl" or "mother-of-pearl."</description>

  <item id="Rudder bands">
    <description>Ancient ships had two great broad-bladed oars for rudders. These, when not in use, were lifted out of the water and bound or tied up. When required for use, these bands were unloosed and the rudders allowed to drop into the water (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 27:40</reflink>).</description>

  <item id="Rue">
    <description>a garden herb (Ruta graveolens) which the Pharisees were careful to tithe (<reflink target="XXX">Luke 11:42</reflink>), neglecting weightier matters. It is omitted in the parallel passage of Matt. 23:23. There are several species growing wild in Palestine. It is used for medicinal and culinary purposes. It has a powerful scent, and is a stimulant.

  <item id="Rufus">
    <description>red, the son of Simon the Cyrenian (<reflink target="XXX">Mark 15:21</reflink>), whom the Roman soldiers compelled to carry the cross on which our Lord was crucified. Probably it is the same person who is again mentioned in Rom. 16:13 as a disciple at Rome, whose mother also was a Christian held in esteem by the apostle. Mark mentions him along with his brother Alexander as persons well known to his readers (<reflink target="XXX">Mark 15:21</reflink>).</description>

  <item id="Rush">
    <description>the papyrus (<reflink target="XXX">Job 8:11</reflink>). (<see target="x-self">See BULRUSH.</see>) The expression "branch and rush" in Isa. 9:14; 19:15 means "utterly."</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Ruth">
    <description>a friend, a Moabitess, the wife of Mahlon, whose father, Elimelech, had settled in the land of Moab. On the death of Elimelech and Mahlon, Naomi came with Ruth, her daughter-in-law, who refused to leave her, to Bethlehem, the old home from which Elimelech had migrated. There she had a rich relative, Boaz, to whom Ruth was eventually married. She became the mother of Obed, the grandfather of David. Thus Ruth, a Gentile, is among the maternal progenitors of our Lord (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 1:5</reflink>). The story of "the gleaner Ruth illustrates the friendly relations between the good Boaz and his reapers, the Jewish land system, the method of transferring property from one person to another, the working of the Mosaic law for the relief of distressed and ruined families; but, above all, handing down the unselfishness, the brave love, the unshaken trustfulness of her who, though not of the chosen race, was, like the Canaanitess Tamar (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 38:29; Matt. 1:3</reflink>) and the Canaanitess Rahab (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 1:5</reflink>), privileged to become the ancestress of David, and so of 'great David's greater Son'" (<reflink target="XXX">Ruth 4:18-22</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Ruth The Book of">
    <description>was originally a part of the Book of Judges, but it now forms one of the twenty-four separate books of the Hebrew Bible.</description>
    <description>The history it contains refers to a period perhaps about one hundred and twenty-six years before the birth of David. It gives (1) an account of Naomi's going to Moab with her husband, Elimelech, and of her subsequent return to Bethlehem with her daughter-in-law; (2) the marriage of Boaz and Ruth; and (3) the birth of Obed, of whom David sprang.</description>
    <description>The author of this book was probably Samuel, according to Jewish tradition.</description>
    <description>"Brief as this book is, and simple as is its story, it is remarkably rich in examples of faith, patience, industry, and kindness, nor less so in indications of the care which God takes of those who put their trust in him."</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Rye">
    <description>=Rie, (Heb. kussemeth), found in Ex. 9:32; Isa. 28:25, in all of which the margins of the Authorized and of the Revised Versions have "spelt." This Hebrew word also occurs in Ezek. 4:9, where the Authorized Version has "fitches' (q.v.) and the Revised Version "spelt." This, there can be no doubt, was the Triticum spelta, a species of hard, rough-grained wheat.</description>

  <item id="Sabachthani">

  <item id="Sabaoth">
    <description>the transliteration of the Hebrew word _tsebha'oth_, meaning "hosts," "armies" (<reflink target="XXX">Rom. 9:29; James 5:4</reflink>). In the LXX. the Hebrew word is rendered by "Almighty." (<reflink target="XXX">See Rev. 4:8; comp. Isa. 6:3.</reflink>) It may designate Jehovah as either (1) God of the armies of earth, or (2) God of the armies of the stars, or (3) God of the unseen armies of angels; or perhaps it may include all these ideas.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Sabbath">
    <description>(Heb. verb shabbath, meaning "to rest from labour"), the day of rest. It is first mentioned as having been instituted in Paradise, when man was in innocence (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 2:2</reflink>). "The sabbath was made for man," as a day of rest and refreshment for the body and of blessing to the soul.</description>
    <description>It is next referred to in connection with the gift of manna to the children of Israel in the wilderness (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 16:23</reflink>); and afterwards, when the law was given from Sinai (20:11), the people were solemnly charged to "remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy." Thus it is spoken of as an institution already existing.</description>
    <description>In the Mosaic law strict regulations were laid down regarding its observance (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 35:2, 3; Lev. 23:3; 26:34</reflink>). These were peculiar to that dispensation.</description>
    <description>In the subsequent history of the Jews frequent references are made to the sanctity of the Sabbath (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 56:2, 4, 6, 7; 58:13, 14; Jer. 17:20-22; Neh. 13:19</reflink>). In later times they perverted the Sabbath by their traditions. Our Lord rescued it from their perversions, and recalled to them its true nature and intent (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 12:10-13; Mark 2:27; Luke 13:10-17</reflink>).</description>
    <description>The Sabbath, originally instituted for man at his creation, is of permanent and universal obligation. The physical necessities of man require a Sabbath of rest. He is so constituted that his bodily welfare needs at least one day in seven for rest from ordinary labour. Experience also proves that the moral and spiritual necessities of men also demand a Sabbath of rest. "I am more and more sure by experience that the reason for the observance of the Sabbath lies deep in the everlasting necessities of human nature, and that as long as man is man the blessedness of keeping it, not as a day of rest only, but as a day of spiritual rest, will never be annulled. I certainly do feel by experience the eternal obligation, because of the eternal necessity, of the Sabbath. The soul withers without it. It thrives in proportion to its observance. The Sabbath was made for man. God made it for men in a certain spiritual state because they needed it. The need, therefore, is deeply hidden in human nature. He who can dispense with it must be holy and spiritual indeed. And he who, still unholy and unspiritual, would yet dispense with it is a man that would fain be wiser than his Maker" (F. W. Robertson).</description>
    <description>The ancient Babylonian calendar, as seen from recently recovered inscriptions on the bricks among the ruins of the royal palace, was based on the division of time into weeks of seven days. The Sabbath is in these inscriptions designated Sabattu, and defined as "a day of rest for the heart" and "a day of completion of labour."</description>
    <description>The change of the day. Originally at creation the seventh day of the week was set apart and consecrated as the Sabbath. The first day of the week is now observed as the Sabbath. Has God authorized this change? There is an obvious distinction between the Sabbath as an institution and the particular day set apart for its observance. The question, therefore, as to the change of the day in no way affects the perpetual obligation of the Sabbath as an institution. Change of the day or no change, the Sabbath remains as a sacred institution the same. It cannot be abrogated.</description>
    <description>If any change of the day has been made, it must have been by Christ or by his authority. Christ has a right to make such a change (<reflink target="XXX">Mark 2:23-28</reflink>). As Creator, Christ was the original Lord of the Sabbath (<reflink target="XXX">John 1:3; Heb. 1:10</reflink>). It was originally a memorial of creation. A work vastly greater than that of creation has now been accomplished by him, the work of redemption. We would naturally expect just such a change as would make the Sabbath a memorial of that greater work.</description>
    <description>True, we can give no text authorizing the change in so many words. We have no express law declaring the change. But there are evidences of another kind. We know for a fact that the first day of the week has been observed from apostolic times, and the necessary conclusion is, that it was observed by the apostles and their immediate disciples. This, we may be sure, they never would have done without the permission or the authority of their Lord.</description>
    <description>After his resurrection, which took place on the first day of the week (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 28:1; Mark 16:2; Luke 24:1; John 20:1</reflink>), we never find Christ meeting with his disciples on the seventh day. But he specially honoured the first day by manifesting himself to them on four separate occasions (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 28:9; Luke 24:34, 18-33; John 20:19-23</reflink>). Again, on the next first day of the week, Jesus appeared to his disciples (<reflink target="XXX">John 20:26</reflink>).</description>
    <description>Some have calculated that Christ's ascension took place on the first day of the week. And there can be no doubt that the descent of the Holy Ghost at Pentecost was on that day (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 2:1</reflink>). Thus Christ appears as instituting a new day to be observed by his people as the Sabbath, a day to be henceforth known amongst them as the "Lord's day." The observance of this "Lord's day" as the Sabbath was the general custom of the primitive churches, and must have had apostolic sanction (<reflink target="XXX">comp. Acts 20:3-7; 1 Cor. 16:1, 2</reflink>) and authority, and so the sanction and authority of Jesus Christ.</description>
    <description>The words "at her sabbaths" (<reflink target="XXX">Lam. 1:7, A.V.</reflink>) ought probably to be, as in the Revised Version, "at her desolations."</description>

  <item id="Sabbath day's journey">

Ex. 23:10, 11, 12; Lev. 26:34, 35</reflink>). Whatever grew of itself during that year was not for the owner of the land, but for the poor and the stranger and the beasts of the field. All debts, except those of foreigners, were to be remitted (<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 15:1-11</reflink>). There is little notice of the observance of this year in Biblical history. It appears to have been much neglected (<reflink target="XXX">2 Chr. 36:20, 21</reflink>).</description>

This word, in Ezek. 23:42, should be read, as in the margin of the Authorized Version, and in the Revised Version, "drunkards."

It was put upon animals by the people of Nineveh (<reflink target="XXX">Jonah 3:8</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Sacrifice">
    <description>The offering up of sacrifices is to be regarded as a divine institution. It did not originate with man. God himself appointed it as the mode in which acceptable worship was to be offered to him by guilty man. The language and the idea of sacrifice pervade the whole Bible.</description>
    <description>Sacrifices were offered in the ante-diluvian age. The Lord clothed Adam and Eve with the skins of animals, which in all probability had been offered in sacrifice (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 3:21</reflink>). Abel offered a sacrifice "of the firstlings of his flock" (4:4; Heb. 11:4). A distinction also was made between clean and unclean animals, which there is every reason to believe had reference to the offering up of sacrifices (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 7:2, 8</reflink>), because animals were not given to man as food till after the Flood.</description>
    <description>The same practice is continued down through the patriarchal age (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 8:20; 12:7; 13:4, 18; 15:9-11; 22:1-18, etc.</reflink>). In the Mosaic period of Old Testament history definite laws were prescribed by God regarding the different kinds of sacrifices that were to be offered and the manner in which the offering was to be made. The offering of stated sacrifices became indeed a prominent and distinctive feature of the whole period (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 12:3-27; Lev. 23:5-8; Num. 9:2-14</reflink>). (<see target="x-self">See ALTAR.</see>)</description>
    <description>We learn from the Epistle to the Hebrews that sacrifices had in themselves no value or efficacy. They were only the "shadow of good things to come," and pointed the worshippers forward to the coming of the great High Priest, who, in the fullness of the time, "was offered once for all to bear the sin of many." Sacrifices belonged to a temporary economy, to a system of types and emblems which served their purposes and have now passed away. The "one sacrifice for sins" hath "perfected for ever them that are sanctified."</description>
    <description>Sacrifices were of two kinds: 1. Unbloody, such as (1) first-fruits and tithes; (2) meat and drink-offerings; and (3) incense. 2. Bloody, such as (1) burnt-offerings; (2) peace-offerings; and (3) sin and trespass offerings. (<see target="x-self">See OFFERINGS.</see>)</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Sadducees">
    <description>The origin of this Jewish sect cannot definitely be traced. It was probably the outcome of the influence of Grecian customs and philosophy during the period of Greek domination. The first time they are met with is in connection with John the Baptist's ministry. They came out to him when on the banks of the Jordan, and he said to them, "O generation of vipers, who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come?" (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 3:7.</reflink>) The next time they are spoken of they are represented as coming to our Lord tempting him. He calls them "hypocrites" and "a wicked and adulterous generation" (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 16:1-4; 22:23</reflink>). The only reference to them in the Gospels of Mark (12:18-27) and Luke (20:27-38) is their attempting to ridicule the doctrine of the resurrection, which they denied, as they also denied the existence of angels. They are never mentioned in John's Gospel.</description>
    <description>There were many Sadducees among the "elders" of the Sanhedrin. They seem, indeed, to have been as numerous as the Pharisees (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 23:6</reflink>). They showed their hatred of Jesus in taking part in his condemnation (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 16:21; 26:1-3, 59; Mark 8:31; 15:1; Luke 9:22; 22:66</reflink>). They endeavoured to prohibit the apostles from preaching the resurrection of Christ (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 2:24, 31, 32; 4:1, 2; 5:17, 24-28</reflink>). They were the deists or sceptics of that age. They do not appear as a separate sect after the destruction of Jerusalem.</description>

    <description>Heb. karkom, Arab. zafran (i.e., "yellow"), mentioned only in Cant. 4:13, 14; the Crocus sativus. Many species of the crocus are found in Palestine. The pistils and stigmata, from the centre of its flowers, are pressed into "saffron cakes," common in the East. "We found," says Tristram, "saffron a very useful condiment in travelling cookery, a very small pinch of it giving not only a rich yellow colour but an agreable flavour to a dish of rice or to an insipid stew."</description>

    <description>The "saints" spoken of in Jude 1:14 are probably not the disciples of Christ, but the "innumerable company of angels" (<reflink target="XXX">Heb. 12:22; Ps. 68:17</reflink>), with reference to Deut. 33:2.</description>
    <description>This word is also used of the holy dead (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 27:52; Rev. 18:24</reflink>). It was not used as a distinctive title of the apostles and evangelists and of a "spiritual nobility" till the fourth century. In that sense it is not a scriptural title.</description>

    <description>shady; or Zalmon (q.v.), a hill covered with dark forests, south of Shechem, from which Abimelech and his men gathered wood to burn that city (<reflink target="XXX">Judg. 9:48</reflink>). In Ps. 68:14 the change from war to peace is likened to snow on the dark mountain, as some interpret the expression. Others suppose the words here mean that the bones of the slain left unburied covered the land, so that it seemed to be white as if covered with snow. The reference, however, of the psalm is probably to Josh. 11 and 12. The scattering of the kings and their followers is fitly likened unto the snow-flakes rapidly falling on the dark Salmon. It is the modern Jebel Suleiman.</description>

On the occasion of the birthday festival held by Herod Antipas, who had married her mother Herodias, in the fortress of Machaerus, she "came in and danced, and pleased Herod" (<reflink target="XXX">Mark 6:14-29</reflink>). John the Baptist, at that time a prisoner in the dungeons underneath the castle, was at her request beheaded by order of Herod, and his head given to the damsel in a charger, "and the damsel gave it to her mother," whose revengeful spirit was thus gratified. "A luxurious feast of the period" (says Farrar, Life of Christ) "was not regarded as complete unless it closed with some gross pantomimic representation; and doubtless Herod had adopted the evil fashion of his day. But he had not anticipated for his guests the rare luxury of seeing a princess, his own niece, a grand-daughter of Herod the Great and of Mariamne, a descendant, therefore, of Simon the high priest and the great line of Maccabean princes, a princess who afterwards became the wife of a tetrarch [Philip, tetrarch of Trachonitis] and the mother of a king, honouring them by degrading herself into a scenic dancer."</description>

All meat-offerings were seasoned with salt (<reflink target="XXX">Lev. 2:13</reflink>). To eat salt with one is to partake of his hospitality, to derive subsistence from him; and hence he who did so was bound to look after his host's interests (<reflink target="XXX">Ezra 4:14, "We have maintenance from the king's palace;" A.V. marg., "We are salted with the salt of the palace;" R.V., "We eat the salt of the palace"</reflink>).</description>
    <description>A "covenant of salt" (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 18:19; 2 Chr. 13:5</reflink>) was a covenant of perpetual obligation. New-born children were rubbed with salt (<reflink target="XXX">Ezek. 16:4</reflink>). Disciples are likened unto salt, with reference to its cleansing and preserving uses (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 5:13</reflink>). When Abimelech took the city of Shechem, he sowed the place with salt, that it might always remain a barren soil (<reflink target="XXX">Judg. 9:45</reflink>). Sir Lyon Playfair argues, on scientific grounds, that under the generic name of "salt," in certain passages, we are to understand petroleum or its residue asphalt. Thus in Gen. 19:26 he would read "pillar of asphalt;" and in Matt. 5:13, instead of "salt," "petroleum," which loses its essence by exposure, as salt does not, and becomes asphalt, with which pavements were made.</description>

Hence some interpreters would insert the words, "and he smote Edom," after the words, "Syrians" in the above text. It is conjectured that while David was leading his army against the Ammonites and Syrians, the Edomites invaded the south of Judah, and that David sent Joab or Abishai against them, who drove them back and finally subdued Edom.

  <item id="Salutation">
    <description>"Eastern modes of salutation are not unfrequently so prolonged as to become wearisome and a positive waste of time. The profusely polite Arab asks so many questions after your health, your happiness, your welfare, your house, and other things, that a person ignorant of the habits of the country would imagine there must be some secret ailment or mysterious sorrow oppressing you, which you wished to conceal, so as to spare the feelings of a dear, sympathizing friend, but which he, in the depth of his anxiety, would desire to hear of. I have often listened to these prolonged salutations in the house, the street, and the highway, and not unfrequently I have experienced their tedious monotony, and I have bitterly lamented useless waste of time" (Porter, Through Samaria, etc.).

  <item id="Samaria">
    <description>a watch-mountain or a watch-tower. In the heart of the mountains of Israel, a few miles north-west of Shechem, stands the "hill of Shomeron," a solitary mountain, a great "mamelon." It is an oblong hill, with steep but not inaccessible sides, and a long flat top. Omri, the king of Israel, purchased this hill from Shemer its owner for two talents of silver, and built on its broad summit the city to which he gave the name of "Shomeron", i.e., Samaria, as the new capital of his kingdom instead of Tirzah (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 16:24</reflink>). As such it possessed many advantages. Here Omri resided during the last six years of his reign. As the result of an unsuccessful war with Syria, he appears to have been obliged to grant to the Syrians the right to "make streets in Samaria", i.e., probably permission to the Syrian merchants to carry on their trade in the Israelite capital. This would imply the existence of a considerable Syrian population. "It was the only great city of Palestine created by the sovereign. All the others had been already consecrated by patriarchal tradition or previous possession. But Samaria was the choice of Omri alone. He, indeed, gave to the city which he had built the name of its former owner, but its especial connection with himself as its founder is proved by the designation which it seems Samaria bears in Assyrian inscriptions, Beth-khumri ('the house or palace of Omri').", Stanley.</description>
    <description>Samaria was frequently besieged. In the days of Ahab, Benhadad II. came up against it with thirty-two vassal kings, but was defeated with a great slaughter (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 20:1-21</reflink>). A second time, next year, he assailed it; but was again utterly routed, and was compelled to surrender to Ahab (20:28-34), whose army, as compared with that of Benhadad, was no more than "two little flocks of kids."</description>
    <description>In the days of Jehoram this Benhadad again laid siege to Samaria, during which the city was reduced to the direst extremities. But just when success seemed to be within their reach, they suddenly broke up the seige, alarmed by a mysterious noise of chariots and horses and a great army, and fled, leaving their camp with all its contents behind them. The famishing inhabitants of the city were soon relieved with the abundance of the spoil of the Syrian camp; and it came to pass, according to the word of Elisha, that "a measure of fine flour was sold for a shekel, and two measures of barely for a shekel, in the gates of Samaria" (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 7:1-20</reflink>).</description>
    <description>Shalmaneser invaded Israel in the days of Hoshea, and reduced it to vassalage. He laid siege to Samaria (B.C. 723), which held out for three years, and was at length captured by Sargon, who completed the conquest Shalmaneser had begun (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 18:9-12; 17:3</reflink>), and removed vast numbers of the tribes into captivity. (<see target="x-self">See SARGON.</see>)</description>
    <description>This city, after passing through various vicissitudes, was given by the emperor Augustus to Herod the Great, who rebuilt it, and called it Sebaste (Gr. form of Augustus) in honour of the emperor. In the New Testament the only mention of it is in Acts 8:5-14, where it is recorded that Philip went down to the city of Samaria and preached there.</description>
    <description>It is now represented by the hamlet of Sebustieh, containing about three hundred inhabitants. The ruins of the ancient town are all scattered over the hill, down the sides of which they have rolled. The shafts of about one hundred of what must have been grand Corinthian columns are still standing, and attract much attention, although nothing definite is known regarding them.

    <description>In the time of Christ, Western Palestine was divided into three provinces, Judea, Samaria, and Galilee. Samaria occupied the centre of Palestine (<reflink target="XXX">John 4:4</reflink>). It is called in the Talmud the "land of the Cuthim," and is not regarded as a part of the Holy Land at all.</description>
    <description>It may be noticed that the distance between Samaria and Jerusalem, the respective capitals of the two kingdoms, is only 35 miles in a direct line.</description>

  <item id="Samaritan Pentateuch">
    <description>On the return from the Exile, the Jews refused the Samaritans participation with them in the worship at Jerusalem, and the latter separated from all fellowship with them, and built a temple for themselves on Mount Gerizim. This temple was razed to the ground more than one hundred years B.C. Then a system of worship was instituted similar to that of the temple at Jerusalem. It was founded on the Law, copies of which had been multiplied in Israel as well as in Judah. Thus the Pentateuch was preserved among the Samaritans, although they never called it by this name, but always "the Law," which they read as one book. The division into five books, as we now have it, however, was adopted by the Samaritans, as it was by the Jews, in all their priests' copies of "the Law," for the sake of convenience. This was the only portion of the Old Testament which was accepted by the Samaritans as of divine authority.</description>
    <description>The form of the letters in the manuscript copies of the Samaritan Pentateuch is different from that of the Hebrew copies, and is probably the same as that which was in general use before the Captivity. There are other peculiarities in the writing which need not here be specified.</description>
    <description>There are important differences between the Hebrew and the Samaritan copies of the Pentateuch in the readings of many sentences. In about two thousand instances in which the Samaritan and the Jewish texts differ, the LXX. agrees with the former. The New Testament also, when quoting from the Old Testament, agrees as a rule with the Samaritan text, where that differs from the Jewish. Thus Ex. 12:40 in the Samaritan reads, "Now the sojourning of the children of Israel and of their fathers which they had dwelt in the land of Canaan and in Egypt was four hundred and thirty years" (<reflink target="XXX">comp. Gal. 3:17</reflink>). It may be noted that the LXX. has the same reading of this text.</description>

Ezra 4:2, 9, 10</reflink>). These strangers (<reflink target="XXX">comp. Luke 17:18</reflink>) amalgamated with the Jews still remaining in the land, and gradually abandoned their old idolatry and adopted partly the Jewish religion.</description>
    <description>After the return from the Captivity, the Jews in Jerusalem refused to allow them to take part with them in rebuilding the temple, and hence sprang up an open enmity between them. They erected a rival temple on Mount Gerizim, which was, however, destroyed by a Jewish king (B.C. 130). They then built another at Shechem. The bitter enmity between the Jews and Samaritans continued in the time of our Lord: the Jews had "no dealings with the Samaritans" (<reflink target="XXX">John 4:9; comp. Luke 9:52, 53</reflink>). Our Lord was in contempt called "a Samaritan" (<reflink target="XXX">John 8:48</reflink>). Many of the Samaritans early embraced the gospel (<reflink target="XXX">John 4:5-42; Acts 8:25; 9:31; 15:3</reflink>). Of these Samaritans there still remains a small population of about one hundred and sixty, who all reside in Shechem, where they carefully observe the religious customs of their fathers. They are the "smallest and oldest sect in the world."</description>

  <item id="Samson">
    <description>of the sun, the son of Manoah, born at Zorah. The narrative of his life is given in Judg. 13-16. He was a "Nazarite unto God" from his birth, the first Nazarite mentioned in Scripture (<reflink target="XXX">Judg. 13:3-5; comp. Num. 6:1-21</reflink>). The first recorded event of his life was his marriage with a Philistine woman of Timnath (<reflink target="XXX">Judg. 14:1-5</reflink>). Such a marriage was not forbidden by the law of Moses, as the Philistines did not form one of the seven doomed Canaanite nations (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 34:11-16; Deut. 7:1-4</reflink>). It was, however, an ill-assorted and unblessed marriage. His wife was soon taken from him and given "to his companion" (<reflink target="XXX">Judg. 14:20</reflink>). For this Samson took revenge by burning the "standing corn of the Philistines" (15:1-8), who, in their turn, in revenge "burnt her and her father with fire." Her death he terribly avenged (15:7-19). During the twenty years following this he judged Israel; but we have no record of his life. Probably these twenty years may have been simultaneous with the last twenty years of Eli's life. After this we have an account of his exploits at Gaza (16:1-3), and of his infatuation for Delilah, and her treachery (16:4-20), and then of his melancholy death (16:21-31). He perished in the last terrible destruction he brought upon his enemies. "So the dead which he slew at his death were more [in social and political importance=the elite of the people] than they which he slew in his life."</description>
    <description>"Straining all his nerves, he bowed: As with the force of winds and waters pent, When mountains tremble, those two massy pillars With horrible convulsion to and fro He tugged, he shook, till down they came, and drew The whole roof after them, with burst of thunder Upon the heads of all who sat beneath, Lords, ladies, captains, counsellors, or priests, Their choice nobility and flower." Milton's Samson Agonistes.</description>

  <item id="Samuel">
    <description>heard of God. The peculiar circumstances connected with his birth are recorded in 1 Sam. 1:20. Hannah, one of the two wives of Elkanah, who came up to Shiloh to worship before the Lord, earnestly prayed to God that she might become the mother of a son. Her prayer was graciously granted; and after the child was weaned she brought him to Shiloh nd consecrated him to the Lord as a perpetual Nazarite (1:23-2:11). Here his bodily wants and training were attended to by the women who served in the tabernacle, while Eli cared for his religious culture. Thus, probably, twelve years of his life passed away. "The child Samuel grew on, and was in favour both with the Lord, and also with men" (2:26; comp. Luke 2:52). It was a time of great and growing degeneracy in Israel (<reflink target="XXX">Judg. 21:19-21; 1 Sam. 2:12-17, 22</reflink>). The Philistines, who of late had greatly increased in number and in power, were practically masters of the country, and kept the people in subjection (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 10:5; 13:3</reflink>).</description>
    <description>At this time new communications from God began to be made to the pious child. A mysterious voice came to him in the night season, calling him by name, and, instructed by Eli, he answered, "Speak, Lord; for thy servant heareth." The message that came from the Lord was one of woe and ruin to Eli and his profligate sons. Samuel told it all to Eli, whose only answer to the terrible denunciations (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 3:11-18</reflink>) was, "It is the Lord; let him do what seemeth him good", the passive submission of a weak character, not, in his case, the expression of the highest trust and faith. The Lord revealed himself now in divers manners to Samuel, and his fame and his influence increased throughout the land as of one divinely called to the prophetical office. A new period in the history of the kingdom of God now commenced.</description>
    <description>The Philistine yoke was heavy, and the people, groaning under the wide-spread oppression, suddenly rose in revolt, and "went out against the Philistines to battle." A fierce and disastrous battle was fought at Aphek, near to Ebenezer (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 4:1, 2</reflink>). The Israelites were defeated, leaving 4,000 dead "in the field." The chiefs of the people thought to repair this great disaster by carrying with them the ark of the covenant as the symbol of Jehovah's presence. They accordingly, without consulting Samuel, fetched it out of Shiloh to the camp near Aphek. At the sight of the ark among them the people "shouted with a great shout, so that the earth rang again." A second battle was fought, and again the Philistines defeated the Israelites, stormed their camp, slew 30,000 men, and took the sacred ark. The tidings of this fatal battle was speedily conveyed to Shiloh; and so soon as the aged Eli heard that the ark of God was taken, he fell backward from his seat at the entrance of the sanctuary, and his neck brake, and he died. The tabernacle with its furniture was probably, by the advice of Samuel, now about twenty years of age, removed from Shiloh to some place of safety, and finally to Nob, where it remained many years (21:1).</description>
    <description>The Philistines followed up their advantage, and marched upon Shiloh, which they plundered and destroyed (<reflink target="XXX">comp. Jer. 7:12; Ps. 78:59</reflink>). This was a great epoch in the history of Israel. For twenty years after this fatal battle at Aphek the whole land lay under the oppression of the Philistines. During all these dreary years Samuel was a spiritual power in the land. From Ramah, his native place, where he resided, his influence went forth on every side among the people. With unwearied zeal he went up and down from place to place, reproving, rebuking, and exhorting the people, endeavouring to awaken in them a sense of their sinfulness, and to lead them to repentance. His labours were so far successful that "all the house of Israel lamented after the Lord." Samuel summoned the people to Mizpeh, one of the loftiest hills in Central Palestine, where they fasted and prayed, and prepared themselves there, under his direction, for a great war against the Philistines, who now marched their whole force toward Mizpeh, in order to crush the Israelites once for all. At the intercession of Samuel God interposed in behalf of Israel. Samuel himself was their leader, the only occasion in which he acted as a leader in war. The Philistines were utterly routed. They fled in terror before the army of Israel, and a great slaughter ensued. This battle, fought probably about B.C. 1095, put an end to the forty years of Philistine oppression. In memory of this great deliverance, and in token of gratitude for the help vouchsafed, Samuel set up a great stone in the battlefield, and called it "Ebenezer," saying, "Hitherto hath the Lord helped us" (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 7:1-12</reflink>). This was the spot where, twenty years before, the Israelites had suffered a great defeat, when the ark of God was taken.</description>
    <description>This victory over the Philistines was followed by a long period of peace for Israel (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 7:13, 14</reflink>), during which Samuel exercised the functions of judge, going "from year to year in circuit" from his home in Ramah to Bethel, thence to Gilgal (not that in the Jordan valley, but that which lay to the west of Ebal and Gerizim), and returning by Mizpeh to Ramah. He established regular services at Shiloh, where he built an altar; and at Ramah he gathered a company of young men around him and established a school of the prophets. The schools of the prophets, thus originated, and afterwards established also at Gibeah, Bethel, Gilgal, and Jericho, exercised an important influence on the national character and history of the people in maintaining pure religion in the midst of growing corruption. They continued to the end of the Jewish commonwealth.</description>
    <description>Many years now passed, during which Samuel exercised the functions of his judicial office, being the friend and counsellor of the people in all matters of private and public interest. He was a great statesman as well as a reformer, and all regarded him with veneration as the "seer," the prophet of the Lord. At the close of this period, when he was now an old man, the elders of Israel came to him at Ramah (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 8:4, 5, 19-22</reflink>); and feeling how great was the danger to which the nation was exposed from the misconduct of Samuel's sons, whom he had invested with judicial functions as his assistants, and had placed at Beersheba on the Philistine border, and also from a threatened invasion of the Ammonites, they demanded that a king should be set over them. This request was very displeasing to Samuel. He remonstrated with them, and warned them of the consequences of such a step. At length, however, referring the matter to God, he acceded to their desires, and anointed Saul (q.v.) to be their king (11:15). Before retiring from public life he convened an assembly of the people at Gilgal (ch. 12), and there solemnly addressed them with reference to his own relation to them as judge and prophet.</description>
    <description>The remainder of his life he spent in retirement at Ramah, only occasionally and in special circumstances appearing again in public (1 Sam. 13, 15) with communications from God to king Saul. While mourning over the many evils which now fell upon the nation, he is suddenly summoned (ch.16) to go to Bethlehem and anoint David, the son of Jesse, as king over Israel instead of Saul. After this little is known of him till the time of his death, which took place at Ramah when he was probably about eighty years of age. "And all Israel gathered themselves together, and lamented him, and buried him in his house at Ramah" (25:1), not in the house itself, but in the court or garden of his house. (Comp. 2 Kings 21:18; 2 Chr. 33:20; 1 Kings 2:34; John 19:41.)</description>
    <description>Samuel's devotion to God, and the special favour with which God regarded him, are referred to in Jer. 15:1 and Ps. 99:6.</description>

  <item id="Samuel, Books of">
    <description>The LXX. translators regarded the books of Samuel and of Kings as forming one continuous history, which they divided into four books, which they called "Books of the Kingdom." The Vulgate version followed this division, but styled them "Books of the Kings." These books of Samuel they accordingly called the "First" and "Second" Books of Kings, and not, as in the modern Protestant versions, the "First" and "Second" Books of Samuel.</description>
    <description>The authors of the books of Samuel were probably Samuel, Gad, and Nathan. Samuel penned the first twenty-four chapters of the first book. Gad, the companion of David (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 22:5</reflink>), continued the history thus commenced; and Nathan completed it, probably arranging the whole in the form in which we now have it (<reflink target="XXX">1 Chr. 29:29</reflink>).</description>
    <description>The contents of the books. The first book comprises a period of about a hundred years, and nearly coincides with the life of Samuel. It contains (1) the history of Eli (1-4); (2) the history of Samuel (5-12); (3) the history of Saul, and of David in exile (13-31). The second book, comprising a period of perhaps fifty years, contains a history of the reign of David (1) over Judah (1-4), and (2) over all Israel (5-24), mainly in its political aspects. The last four chapters of Second Samuel may be regarded as a sort of appendix recording various events, but not chronologically. These books do not contain complete histories. Frequent gaps are met with in the record, because their object is to present a history of the kingdom of God in its gradual development, and not of the events of the reigns of the successive rulers. It is noticeable that the section (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 11:2-12: 29</reflink>) containing an account of David's sin in the matter of Bathsheba is omitted in the corresponding passage in 1 Chr. 20.</description>

It is the special office of the Holy Spirit in the plan of redemption to carry on this work (<reflink target="XXX">1 Cor. 6:11; 2 Thess. 2:13</reflink>). Faith is instrumental in securing sanctification, inasmuch as it (1) secures union to Christ (<reflink target="XXX">Gal. 2:20</reflink>), and (2) brings the believer into living contact with the truth, whereby he is led to yield obedience "to the commands, trembling at the threatenings, and embracing the promises of God for this life and that which is to come."</description>
    <description>Perfect sanctification is not attainable in this life (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 8:46; Prov. 20:9; Eccl. 7:20; James 3:2; 1 John 1:8</reflink>). See Paul's account of himself in Rom. 7:14-25; Phil. 3:12-14; and 1 Tim. 1:15; also the confessions of David (<reflink target="XXX">Ps. 19:12, 13; 51</reflink>), of Moses (90:8), of Job (42:5, 6), and of Daniel (9:3-20). "The more holy a man is, the more humble, self-renouncing, self-abhorring, and the more sensitive to every sin he becomes, and the more closely he clings to Christ. The moral imperfections which cling to him he feels to be sins, which he laments and strives to overcome. Believers find that their life is a constant warfare, and they need to take the kingdom of heaven by storm, and watch while they pray. They are always subject to the constant chastisement of their Father's loving hand, which can only be designed to correct their imperfections and to confirm their graces. And it has been notoriously the fact that the best Christians have been those who have been the least prone to claim the attainment of perfection for themselves.", Hodge's Outlines.</description>

In the final state there is properly "no sanctuary" (<reflink target="XXX">Rev. 21:22</reflink>), for God and the Lamb "are the sanctuary" (R.V., "temple"). All is there hallowed by the Divine Presence; all is sancturary.</description>

  <item id="Sandals">
    <description>Mentioned only in Mark 6:9 and Acts 12:8. The sandal was simply a sole, made of wood or palm-bark, fastened to the foot by leathern straps. Sandals were also made of seal-skin (<reflink target="XXX">Ezek. 16:10; lit. tahash, "leather;" A.V., "badger's skin;" R.V., "sealskin," or marg., "porpoise-skin"</reflink>). (<see target="x-self">See SHOE.</see>)</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Sanhedrim">
    <description>more correctly Sanhedrin (Gr. synedrion), meaning "a sitting together," or a "council." This word (rendered "council," A.V.) is frequently used in the New Testament (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 5:22; 26:59; Mark 15:1, etc.</reflink>) to denote the supreme judicial and administrative council of the Jews, which, it is said, was first instituted by Moses, and was composed of seventy men (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 11:16, 17</reflink>). But that seems to have been only a temporary arrangement which Moses made. This council is with greater probability supposed to have originated among the Jews when they were under the domination of the Syrian kings in the time of the Maccabees. The name is first employed by the Jewish historian Josephus. This "council" is referred to simply as the "chief priests and elders of the people" (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 26:3, 47, 57, 59; 27:1, 3, 12, 20, etc.</reflink>), before whom Christ was tried on the charge of claiming to be the Messiah. Peter and John were also brought before it for promulgating heresy (<reflink target="XXX">Acts. 4:1-23; 5:17-41</reflink>); as was also Stephen on a charge of blasphemy (6:12-15), and Paul for violating a temple by-law (22:30; 23:1-10).</description>
    <description>The Sanhedrin is said to have consisted of seventy-one members, the high priest being president. They were of three classes (1) the chief priests, or heads of the twenty-four priestly courses (1 Chr. 24), (2) the scribes, and (3) the elders. As the highest court of judicature, "in all causes and over all persons, ecclesiastical and civil, supreme," its decrees were binding, not only on the Jews in Palestine, but on all Jews wherever scattered abroad. Its jurisdiction was greatly curtailed by Herod, and afterwards by the Romans. Its usual place of meeting was within the precincts of the temple, in the hall "Gazith," but it sometimes met also in the house of the high priest (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 26:3</reflink>), who was assisted by two vice-presidents.</description>

  <item id="Sarah">
    <description>princess, the wife and at the same time the half-sister of Abraham (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 11:29; 20:12</reflink>). This name was given to her at the time that it was announced to Abraham that she should be the mother of the promised child. Her story is from her marriage identified with that of the patriarch till the time of her death. Her death, at the age of one hundred and twenty-seven years (the only instance in Scripture where the age of a woman is recorded), was the occasion of Abraham's purchasing the cave of Machpelah as a family burying-place.</description>
    <description>In the allegory of Gal. 4:22-31 she is the type of the "Jerusalem which is above." She is also mentioned as Sara in Heb. 11:11 among the Old Testament worthies, who "all died in faith." (<see target="x-self">See ABRAHAM.</see>)</description>

  <item id="Sargon">
    <description>(In the inscriptions, "Sarra-yukin" [the god] has appointed the king; also "Sarru-kinu," the legitimate king.) On the death of Shalmaneser (B.C. 723), one of the Assyrian generals established himself on the vacant throne, taking the name of "Sargon," after that of the famous monarch, the Sargon of Accad, founder of the first Semitic empire, as well as of one of the most famous libraries of Chaldea. He forthwith began a conquering career, and became one of the most powerful of the Assyrian monarchs. He is mentioned by name in the Bible only in connection with the siege of Ashdod (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 20:1</reflink>).</description>
    <description>At the very beginning of his reign he besieged and took the city of Samaria (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 17:6; 18:9-12</reflink>). On an inscription found in the palace he built at Khorsabad, near Nieveh, he says, "The city of Samaria I besieged, I took; 27,280 of its inhabitants I carried away; fifty chariots that were among them I collected," etc. The northern kingdom he changed into an Assyrian satrapy. He afterwards drove Merodach-baladan (q.v.), who kept him at bay for twelve years, out of Babylon, which he entered in triumph. By a succession of victories he gradually enlarged and consolidated the empire, which now extended from the frontiers of Egypt in the west to the mountains of Elam in the east, and thus carried almost to completion the ambitious designs of Tiglath-pileser (q.v.). He was murdered by one of his own soldiers (B.C. 705) in his palace at Khorsabad, after a reign of sixteen years, and was succeeded by his son Sennacherib.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Satan">
    <description>adversary; accuser. When used as a proper name, the Hebrew word so rendered has the article "the adversary" (<reflink target="XXX">Job 1:6-12; 2:1-7</reflink>). In the New Testament it is used as interchangeable with Diabolos, or the devil, and is so used more than thirty times.</description>
    <description>He is also called "the dragon," "the old serpent" (<reflink target="XXX">Rev. 12:9; 20:2</reflink>); "the prince of this world" (<reflink target="XXX">John 12:31; 14:30</reflink>); "the prince of the power of the air" (<reflink target="XXX">Eph. 2:2</reflink>); "the god of this world" (<reflink target="XXX">2 Cor. 4:4</reflink>); "the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience" (<reflink target="XXX">Eph. 2:2</reflink>). The distinct personality of Satan and his activity among men are thus obviously recognized. He tempted our Lord in the wilderness (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 4:1-11</reflink>). He is "Beelzebub, the prince of the devils" (12:24). He is "the constant enemy of God, of Christ, of the divine kingdom, of the followers of Christ, and of all truth; full of falsehood and all malice, and exciting and seducing to evil in every possible way." His power is very great in the world. He is a "roaring lion, seeking whom he may devour" (<reflink target="XXX">1 Pet. 5:8</reflink>). Men are said to be "taken captive by him" (<reflink target="XXX">2 Tim. 2:26</reflink>). Christians are warned against his "devices" (<reflink target="XXX">2 Cor. 2:11</reflink>), and called on to "resist" him (<reflink target="XXX">James 4:7</reflink>). Christ redeems his people from "him that had the power of death, that is, the devil" (<reflink target="XXX">Heb. 2:14</reflink>). Satan has the "power of death," not as lord, but simply as executioner.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Satyr">
    <description>hairy one. Mentioned in Greek mythology as a creature composed of a man and a goat, supposed to inhabit wild and desolate regions. The Hebrew word is rendered also "goat" (<reflink target="XXX">Lev. 4:24</reflink>) and "devil", i.e., an idol in the form of a goat (17:7; 2 Chr. 11:15). When it is said (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 13:21; comp. 34:14</reflink>) "the satyrs shall dance there," the meaning is that the place referred to shall become a desolate waste. Some render the Hebrew word "baboon," a species of which is found in Babylonia.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Saul">
    <description>asked for. (1.) A king of Edom (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 36:37, 38</reflink>); called Shaul in 1 Chr. 1:48.</description>
    <description>(2.) The son of Kish (probably his only son, and a child of prayer, "asked for"), of the tribe of Benjamin, the first king of the Jewish nation. The singular providential circumstances connected with his election as king are recorded in 1 Sam. 8-10. His father's she-asses had strayed, and Saul was sent with a servant to seek for them. Leaving his home at Gibeah (10:5, "the hill of God," A.V.; lit., as in R.V. marg., "Gibeah of God"), Saul and his servant went toward the north-west over Mount Ephraim, and then turning north-east they came to "the land of Shalisha," and thence eastward to the land of Shalim, and at length came to the district of Zuph, near Samuel's home at Ramah (9:5-10). At this point Saul proposed to return from the three days' fruitless search, but his servant suggested that they should first consult the "seer." Hearing that he was about to offer sacrifice, the two hastened into Ramah, and "behold, Samuel came out against them," on his way to the "bamah", i.e., the "height", where sacrifice was to be offered; and in answer to Saul's question, "Tell me, I pray thee, where the seer's house is," Samuel made himself known to him. Samuel had been divinely prepared for his coming (9:15-17), and received Saul as his guest. He took him with him to the sacrifice, and then after the feast "communed with Saul upon the top of the house" of all that was in his heart. On the morrow Samuel "took a vial of oil and poured it on his head," and anointed Saul as king over Israel (9:25-10:8), giving him three signs in confirmation of his call to be king. When Saul reached his home in Gibeah the last of these signs was fulfilled, and the Sprit of God came upon him, and "he was turned into another man." The simple countryman was transformed into the king of Israel, a remarkable change suddenly took place in his whole demeanour, and the people said in their astonishment, as they looked on the stalwart son of Kish, "Is Saul also among the prophets?", a saying which passed into a "proverb." (<reflink target="XXX">Comp. 19:24.</reflink>)</description>
    <description>The intercourse between Saul and Samuel was as yet unknown to the people. The "anointing" had been in secret. But now the time had come when the transaction must be confirmed by the nation. Samuel accordingly summoned the people to a solemn assembly "before the Lord" at Mizpeh. Here the lot was drawn (10:17-27), and it fell upon Saul, and when he was presented before them, the stateliest man in all Israel, the air was rent for the first time in Israel by the loud cry, "God save the king!" He now returned to his home in Gibeah, attended by a kind of bodyguard, "a band of men whose hearts God had touched." On reaching his home he dismissed them, and resumed the quiet toils of his former life.</description>
    <description>Soon after this, on hearing of the conduct of Nahash the Ammonite at Jabeshgilead (q.v.), an army out of all the tribes of Israel rallied at his summons to the trysting-place at Bezek, and he led them forth a great army to battle, gaining a complete victory over the Ammonite invaders at Jabesh (11:1-11). Amid the universal joy occasioned by this victory he was now fully recognized as the king of Israel. At the invitation of Samuel "all the people went to Gilgal, and there they made Saul king before the Lord in Gilgal." Samuel now officially anointed him as king (11:15). Although Samuel never ceased to be a judge in Israel, yet now his work in that capacity practically came to an end.</description>
    <description>Saul now undertook the great and difficult enterprise of freeing the land from its hereditary enemies the Philistines, and for this end he gathered together an army of 3,000 men (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 13:1, 2</reflink>). The Philistines were encamped at Geba. Saul, with 2,000 men, occupied Michmash and Mount Bethel; while his son Jonathan, with 1,000 men, occupied Gibeah, to the south of Geba, and seemingly without any direction from his father "smote" the Philistines in Geba. Thus roused, the Philistines, who gathered an army of 30,000 chariots and 6,000 horsemen, and "people as the sand which is on the sea-shore in multitude," encamped in Michmash, which Saul had evacuated for Gilgal. Saul now tarried for seven days in Gilgal before making any movement, as Samuel had appointed (10:8); but becoming impatient on the seventh day, as it was drawing to a close, when he had made an end of offering the burnt offering, Samuel appeared and warned him of the fatal consequences of his act of disobedience, for he had not waited long enough (13:13, 14).</description>
    <description>When Saul, after Samuel's departure, went out from Gilgal with his 600 men, his followers having decreased to that number (13:15), against the Philistines at Michmash (q.v.), he had his head-quarters under a pomegrante tree at Migron, over against Michmash, the Wady esSuweinit alone intervening. Here at Gibeah-Geba Saul and his army rested, uncertain what to do. Jonathan became impatient, and with his armour-bearer planned an assault against the Philistines, unknown to Saul and the army (14:1-15). Jonathan and his armour-bearer went down into the wady, and on their hands and knees climbed to the top of the narrow rocky ridge called Bozez, where was the outpost of the Philistine army. They surprised and then slew twenty of the Philistines, and immediately the whole host of the Philistines was thrown into disorder and fled in great terror. "It was a very great trembling;" a supernatural panic seized the host. Saul and his 600 men, a band which speedily increased to 10,000, perceiving the confusion, pursued the army of the Philistines, and the tide of battle rolled on as far as to Bethaven, halfway between Michmash and Bethel. The Philistines were totally routed. "So the Lord saved Israel that day." While pursuing the Philistines, Saul rashly adjured the people, saying, "Cursed be the man that eateth any food until evening." But though faint and weary, the Israelites "smote the Philistines that day from Michmash to Aijalon" (a distance of from 15 to 20 miles). Jonathan had, while passing through the wood in pursuit of the Philistines, tasted a little of the honeycomb which was abundant there (14:27). This was afterwards discovered by Saul (ver. 42), and he threatened to put his son to death. The people, however, interposed, saying, "There shall not one hair of his head fall to the ground." He whom God had so signally owned, who had "wrought this great salvation in Israel," must not die. "Then Saul went up from following the Philistines: and the Philistines went to their own place" (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 14:24-46</reflink>); and thus the campaign against the Philistines came to an end. This was Saul's second great military success.</description>
    <description>Saul's reign, however, continued to be one of almost constant war against his enemies round about (14:47, 48), in all of which he proved victorious. The war against the Amalekites is the only one which is recorded at length (1 Sam. 15). These oldest and hereditary (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 17:8; Num. 14:43-45</reflink>) enemies of Israel occupied the territory to the south and south-west of Palestine. Samuel summoned Saul to execute the "ban" which God had pronounced (<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 25:17-19</reflink>) on this cruel and relentless foe of Israel. The cup of their iniquity was now full. This command was "the test of his moral qualification for being king." Saul proceeded to execute the divine command; and gathering the people together, marched from Telaim (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 15:4</reflink>) against the Amalekites, whom he smote "from Havilah until thou comest to Shur," utterly destroying "all the people with the edge of the sword", i.e., all that fell into his hands. He was, however, guilty of rebellion and disobedience in sparing Agag their king, and in conniving at his soldiers' sparing the best of the sheep and cattle; and Samuel, following Saul to Gilgal, in the Jordan valley, said unto him, "Because thou hast rejected the word of the Lord, he also hath rejected thee from being king" (15:23). The kingdom was rent from Saul and was given to another, even to David, whom the Lord chose to be Saul's successor, and whom Samuel anointed (16:1-13). From that day "the spirit of the Lord departed from Saul, and an evil spirit from the Lord troubled him." He and Samuel parted only to meet once again at one of the schools of the prophets.</description>
    <description>David was now sent for as a "cunning player on an harp" (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 16:16, 18</reflink>), to play before Saul when the evil spirit troubled him, and thus was introduced to the court of Saul. He became a great favourite with the king. At length David returned to his father's house and to his wonted avocation as a shepherd for perhaps some three years. The Philistines once more invaded the land, and gathered their army between Shochoh and Azekah, in Ephes-dammim, on the southern slope of the valley of Elah. Saul and the men of Israel went forth to meet them, and encamped on the northern slope of the same valley which lay between the two armies. It was here that David slew Goliath of Gath, the champion of the Philistines (17:4-54), an exploit which led to the flight and utter defeat of the Philistine army. Saul now took David permanently into his service (18:2); but he became jealous of him (ver. 9), and on many occasions showed his enmity toward him (ver. 10, 11), his enmity ripening into a purpose of murder which at different times he tried in vain to carry out.</description>
    <description>After some time the Philistines "gathered themselves together" in the plain of Esdraelon, and pitched their camp at Shunem, on the slope of Little Hermon; and Saul "gathered all Israel together," and "pitched in Gilboa" (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 28:3-14</reflink>). Being unable to discover the mind of the Lord, Saul, accompanied by two of his retinue, betook himself to the "witch of Endor," some 7 or 8 miles distant. Here he was overwhelmed by the startling communication that was mysteriously made to him by Samuel (ver. 16-19), who appeared to him. "He fell straightway all along on the earth, and was sore afraid, because of the words of Samuel" (ver. 20). The Philistine host "fought against Israel: and the men of Israel fled before the Philistines, and fell down slain in Mount Gilboa" (31:1). In his despair at the disaster that had befallen his army, Saul "took a sword and fell upon it." And the Philistines on the morrow "found Saul and his three sons fallen in Mount Gilboa." Having cut off his head, they sent it with his weapons to Philistia, and hung up the skull in the temple of Dagon at Ashdod. They suspended his headless body, with that of Jonathan, from the walls of Bethshan. The men of Jabesh-gilead afterwards removed the bodies from this position; and having burnt the flesh, they buried the bodies under a tree at Jabesh. The remains were, however, afterwards removed to the family sepulchre at Zelah (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 21:13, 14</reflink>). (<see target="x-self">See DAVID.</see>)</description>
    <description>(3.) "Who is also called Paul" (q.v.), the circumcision name of the apostle, given to him, perhaps, in memory of King Saul (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 7:58; 8:1; 9:1</reflink>).</description>

  <item id="Saviour">
    <description>one who saves from any form or degree of evil. In its highest sense the word indicates the relation sustained by our Lord to his redeemed ones, he is their Saviour. The great message of the gospel is about salvation and the Saviour. It is the "gospel of salvation." Faith in the Lord Jesus Christ secures to the sinner a personal interest in the work of redemption. Salvation is redemption made effectual to the individual by the power of the Holy Spirit.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Scapegoat">
    <description>Lev. 16:8-26; R.V., "the goat for Azazel" (q.v.), the name given to the goat which was taken away into the wilderness on the day of Atonement (16:20-22). The priest made atonement over the scapegoat, laying Israel's guilt upon it, and then sent it away, the goat bearing "upon him all their iniquities unto a land not inhabited."</description>
    <description>At a later period an evasion or modification of the law of Moses was introduced by the Jews. "The goat was conducted to a mountain named Tzuk, situated at a distance of ten Sabbath days' journey, or about six and a half English miles, from Jerusalem. At this place the Judean desert was supposed to commence; and the man in whose charge the goat was sent out, while setting him free, was instructed to push the unhappy beast down the slope of the mountain side, which was so steep as to insure the death of the goat, whose bones were broken by the fall. The reason of this barbarous custom was that on one occasion the scapegoat returned to Jerusalem after being set free, which was considered such an evil omen that its recurrence was prevented for the future by the death of the goat" (Twenty-one Years' Work in the Holy Land). This mountain is now called el-Muntar.</description>

  <item id="Scarlet">
    <description>This dye was obtained by the Egyptians from the shell-fish Carthamus tinctorius; and by the Hebrews from the Coccus ilicis, an insect which infests oak trees, called kermes by the Arabians.</description>
    <description>This colour was early known (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 38:28</reflink>). It was one of the colours of the ephod (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 28:6</reflink>), the girdle (8), and the breastplate (15) of the high priest. It is also mentioned in various other connections (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 2:18; 2 Sam. 1:24; Lam. 4:5; Nahum 2:3</reflink>). A scarlet robe was in mockery placed on our Lord (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 27:28; Luke 23:11</reflink>). "Sins as scarlet" (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 1:18</reflink>), i.e., as scarlet robes "glaring and habitual." Scarlet and crimson were the firmest of dyes, and thus not easily washed out.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Sceptre">
    <description>(Heb. shebet = Gr. skeptron), properly a staff or rod. As a symbol of authority, the use of the sceptre originated in the idea that the ruler was as a shepherd of his people (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 49:10; Num. 24:17; Ps. 45:6; Isa. 14:5</reflink>). There is no example on record of a sceptre having ever been actually handled by a Jewish king.</description>

  <item id="Sceva">
    <description>an implement, a Jew, chief of the priests at Ephesus (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 19:13-16</reflink>); i.e., the head of one of the twenty-four courses of the house of Levi. He had seven sons, who "took upon them to call over them which had evil spirits the name of the Lord Jesus," in imitation of Paul. They tried their method of exorcism on a fierce demoniac, and failed. His answer to them was to this effect (19:15): "The Jesus whom you invoke is One whose authority I acknowledge; and the Paul whom you name I recognize to be a servant or messenger of God; but what sort of men are ye who have been empowered to act as you do by neither?"

    <description>the law so designated by Paul (<reflink target="XXX">Gal. 3:24, 25</reflink>). As so used, the word does not mean teacher, but pedagogue (shortened into the modern page), i.e., one who was intrusted with the supervision of a family, taking them to and from the school, being responsible for their safety and manners. Hence the pedagogue was stern and severe in his discipline. Thus the law was a pedagogue to the Jews, with a view to Christ, i.e., to prepare for faith in Christ by producing convictions of guilt and helplessness. The office of the pedagogue ceased when "faith came", i.e., the object of that faith, the seed, which is Christ.</description>

In the time of the apostles, in consequence of the passing of what was called the Porcian law, no Roman citizen could be scourged in any case (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 16:22-37</reflink>). (<see target="x-self">See BASTINADO.</see>) In the scourging of our Lord (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 27:26; Mark 15:15</reflink>) the words of prophecy (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 53:5</reflink>) were fulfilled.</description>

  <item id="Scribes">
    <description>anciently held various important offices in the public affairs of the nation. The Hebrew word so rendered (sopher) is first used to designate the holder of some military office (<reflink target="XXX">Judg. 5:14; A.V., "pen of the writer;" R.V., "the marshal's staff;" marg., "the staff of the scribe"</reflink>). The scribes acted as secretaries of state, whose business it was to prepare and issue decrees in the name of the king (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 8:17; 20:25; 1 Chr. 18:16; 24:6; 1 Kings 4:3; 2 Kings 12:9-11; 18:18-37, etc.</reflink>). They discharged various other important public duties as men of high authority and influence in the affairs of state.</description>
    <description>There was also a subordinate class of scribes, most of whom were Levites. They were engaged in various ways as writers. Such, for example, was Baruch, who "wrote from the mouth of Jeremiah all the words of the Lord" (<reflink target="XXX">Jer. 36:4, 32</reflink>).</description>
    <description>In later times, after the Captivity, when the nation lost its independence, the scribes turned their attention to the law, gaining for themselves distinction by their intimate acquaintance with its contents. On them devolved the duty of multiplying copies of the law and of teaching it to others (<reflink target="XXX">Ezra 7:6, 10-12; Neh. 8:1, 4, 9, 13</reflink>). It is evident that in New Testament times the scribes belonged to the sect of the Pharisees, who supplemented the ancient written law by their traditions (Matt. 23), thereby obscuring it and rendering it of none effect. The titles "scribes" and "lawyers" (q.v.) are in the Gospels interchangeable (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 22:35; Mark 12:28; Luke 20:39, etc.</reflink>). They were in the time of our Lord the public teachers of the people, and frequently came into collision with him. They afterwards showed themselves greatly hostile to the apostles (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 4:5; 6:12</reflink>).</description>
    <description>Some of the scribes, however, were men of a different spirit, and showed themselves friendly to the gospel and its preachers. Thus Gamaliel advised the Sanhedrin, when the apostles were before them charged with "teaching in this name," to "refrain from these men and let them alone" (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 5:34-39; comp. 23:9</reflink>).</description>

  <item id="Scrip">
    <description>a small bag or wallet usually fastened to the girdle (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 17:40</reflink>); "a shepherd's bag."</description>
    <description>In the New Testament it is the rendering of Gr. pera, which was a bag carried by travellers and shepherds, generally made of skin (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 10:10; Mark 6:8; Luke 9:3; 10:4</reflink>). The name "scrip" is meant to denote that the bag was intended to hold scraps, fragments, as if scraped off from larger articles, trifles.</description>

  <item id="Scripture">
    <description>invariably in the New Testament denotes that definite collection of sacred books, regarded as given by inspiration of God, which we usually call the Old Testament (<reflink target="XXX">2 Tim. 3:15, 16; John 20:9; Gal. 3:22; 2 Pet. 1:20</reflink>). It was God's purpose thus to perpetuate his revealed will. From time to time he raised up men to commit to writing in an infallible record the revelation he gave. The "Scripture," or collection of sacred writings, was thus enlarged from time to time as God saw necessary. We have now a completed "Scripture," consisting of the Old and New Testaments. The Old Testament canon in the time of our Lord was precisely the same as that which we now possess under that name. He placed the seal of his own authority on this collection of writings, as all equally given by inspiration (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 5:17; 7:12; 22:40; Luke 16:29, 31</reflink>).

Of this vast country but little was anciently known. Its modern representative is Russia, which, to a great extent, includes the same territories." They were the descendants of Japheth (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 9:27</reflink>). It appears that in apostolic times there were some of this people that embraced Christianity (<reflink target="XXX">Col. 3:11</reflink>).</description>

  <item id="Sea of glass">
    <description>a figurative expression used in Rev. 4:6 and 15:2. According to the interpretation of some, "this calm, glass-like sea, which is never in storm, but only interfused with flame, represents the counsels of God, those purposes of righteousness and love which are often fathomless but never obscure, always the same, though sometimes glowing with holy anger."

  <item id="Sea, The">
    <description>(Heb. yam), signifies (1) "the gathering together of the waters," the ocean (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 1:10</reflink>); (2) a river, as the Nile (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 19:5</reflink>), the Euphrates (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 21:1; Jer. 51:36</reflink>); (3) the Red Sea (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 14:16, 27; 15:4, etc.</reflink>); (4) the Mediterranean (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 23:31; Num. 34:6, 7; Josh. 15:47; Ps. 80:11, etc.</reflink>); (5) the "sea of Galilee," an inland fresh-water lake, and (6) the Dead Sea or "salt sea" (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 14:3; Num. 34:3, 12, etc.</reflink>). The word "sea" is used symbolically in Isa. 60:5, where it probably means the nations around the Mediterranean. In Dan. 7:3, Rev. 13:1 it may mean the tumultuous changes among the nations of the earth.</description>

  <item id="Sea, The molten">
    <description>the great laver made by Solomon for the use of the priests in the temple, described in 1 Kings 7:23-26; 2 Chr. 4:2-5. It stood in the south-eastern corner of the inner court. It was 5 cubits high, 10 in diameter from brim to brim, and 30 in circumference. It was placed on the backs of twelve oxen, standing with their faces outward. It was capable of containing two or three thousand baths of water (comp. 2 Chr. 4:5), which was originally supplied by the Gibeonites, but was afterwards brought by a conduit from the pools of Bethlehem. It was made of "brass" (copper), which Solomon had taken from the captured cities of Hadarezer, the king of Zobah (<reflink target="XXX">1 Chr. 18:8</reflink>). Ahaz afterwards removed this laver from the oxen, and placed it on a stone pavement (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 16:17</reflink>). It was destroyed by the Chaldeans (25:13).</description>

  <item id="Seal">
    <description>commonly a ring engraved with some device (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 38:18, 25</reflink>). Jezebel "wrote letters in Ahab's name, and sealed them with his seal" (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 21:8</reflink>). Seals are frequently mentioned in Jewish history (<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 32:34; Neh. 9:38; 10:1; Esther 3:12; Cant. 8:6; Isa. 8:16; Jer. 22:24; 32:44, etc.</reflink>). Sealing a document was equivalent to the signature of the owner of the seal. "The use of a signet-ring by the monarch has recently received a remarkable illustration by the discovery of an impression of such a signet on fine clay at Koyunjik, the site of the ancient Nineveh. This seal appears to have been impressed from the bezel of a metallic finger-ring. It is an oval, 2 inches in length by 1 inch wide, and bears the image, name, and titles of the Egyptian king Sabaco" (Rawlinson's Hist. Illus. of the O.T., p. 46). The actual signet-rings of two Egyptian kings (Cheops and Horus) have been discovered. (<see target="x-self">See SIGNET.</see>)</description>
    <description>The use of seals is mentioned in the New Testament only in connection with the record of our Lord's burial (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 27:66</reflink>). The tomb was sealed by the Pharisees and chief priests for the purpose of making sure that the disciples would not come and steal the body away (ver. 63, 64). The mode of doing this was probably by stretching a cord across the stone and sealing it at both ends with sealing-clay. When God is said to have sealed the Redeemer, the meaning is, that he has attested his divine mission (<reflink target="XXX">John 6:27</reflink>). Circumcision is a seal, an attestation of the covenant (<reflink target="XXX">Rom. 4:11</reflink>). Believers are sealed with the Spirit, as God's mark put upon them (<reflink target="XXX">Eph. 1:13; 4:30</reflink>). Converts are by Paul styled the seal of his apostleship, i.e., they are its attestation (<reflink target="XXX">1 Cor. 9:2</reflink>). Seals and sealing are frequently mentioned in the book of Revelation (5:1; 6:1; 7:3; 10:4; 22:10).</description>

  <item id="Sennacherib">
    <description>Sin (the god) sends many brothers, son of Sargon, whom he succeeded on the throne of Assyria (B.C. 705), in the 23rd year of Hezekiah. "Like the Persian Xerxes, he was weak and vainglorious, cowardly under reverse, and cruel and boastful in success." He first set himself to break up the powerful combination of princes who were in league against him. Among these was Hezekiah, who had entered into an alliance with Egypt against Assyria. He accordingly led a very powerful army of at least 200,000 men into Judea, and devastated the land on every side, taking and destroying many cities (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 18:13-16; comp. Isa. 22, 24, 29, and 2 Chr. 32:1-8</reflink>). His own account of this invasion, as given in the Assyrian annals, is in these words: "Because Hezekiah, king of Judah, would not submit to my yoke, I came up against him, and by force of arms and by the might of my power I took forty-six of his strong fenced cities; and of the smaller towns which were scattered about, I took and plundered a countless number. From these places I took and carried off 200,156 persons, old and young, male and female, together with horses and mules, asses and camels, oxen and sheep, a countless multitude; and Hezekiah himself I shut up in Jerusalem, his capital city, like a bird in a cage, building towers round the city to hem him in, and raising banks of earth against the gates, so as to prevent escape...Then upon Hezekiah there fell the fear of the power of my arms, and he sent out to me the chiefs and the elders of Jerusalem with 30 talents of gold and 800 talents of silver, and divers treasures, a rich and immense booty...All these things were brought to me at Nineveh, the seat of my government." (<reflink target="XXX">Comp. Isa. 22:1-13 for description of the feelings of the inhabitants of Jerusalem at such a crisis.</reflink>)</description>
    <description>Hezekiah was not disposed to become an Assyrian feudatory. He accordingly at once sought help from Egypt (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 18:20-24</reflink>). Sennacherib, hearing of this, marched a second time into Palestine (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 18:17, 37; 19; 2 Chr. 32:9-23; Isa. 36:2-22. Isa. 37:25 should be rendered "dried up all the Nile-arms of Matsor," i.e., of Egypt, so called from the "Matsor" or great fortification across the isthmus of Suez, which protected it from invasions from the east</reflink>). Sennacherib sent envoys to try to persuade Hezekiah to surrender, but in vain. (See TIRHAKAH</description>
    <description>This great disaster is not, as was to be expected, taken notice of in the Assyrian annals.</description>
    <description>Though Sennacherib survived this disaster some twenty years, he never again renewed his attempt against Jerusalem. He was murdered by two of his own sons (Adrammelech and Sharezer), and was succeeded by another son, Esarhaddon (B.C. 681), after a reign of twenty-four years.</description>

The modern Jews think that Spain is meant, and hence they designate the Spanish Jews "Sephardim," as they do the German Jews by the name "Ashkenazim," because the rabbis call Germany Ashkenaz. Others identify it with Sardis, the capital of Lydia. The Latin father Jerome regarded it as an Assyrian word, meaning "boundary," and interpreted the sentence, "which is in Sepharad," by "who are scattered abroad in all the boundaries and regions of the earth." Perowne says: "Whatever uncertainty attaches to the word Sepharad, the drift of the prophecy is clear, viz., that not only the exiles from Babylon, but Jewish captives from other and distant regions, shall be brought back to live prosperously within the enlarged borders of their own land."</description>

    <description>first mentioned as purchased by Abraham for Sarah from Ephron the Hittite (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 23:20</reflink>). This was the "cave of the field of Machpelah," where also Abraham and Rebekah and Jacob and Leah were burried (79:29-32). In Acts 7:16 it is said that Jacob was "laid in the sepulchre that Abraham bought for a sum of money of the sons of Emmor the father of Sychem." It has been proposed, as a mode of reconciling the apparent discrepancy between this verse and Gen. 23:20, to read Acts 7:16 thus: "And they [i.e., our fathers] were carried over into Sychem, and laid in the sepulchre that Abraham bought for a sum of money of the sons of Emmor [the son] of Sychem." In this way the purchase made by Abraham is not to be confounded with the purchase made by Jacob subsequently in the same district.

    <description>(8.) A priest of the days of Jehoiakim (<reflink target="XXX">Neh. 12:1, 12</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(9.) The son of Neriah. When Zedekiah made a journey to Babylon to do homage to Nebuchadnezzar, Seraiah had charge of the royal gifts to be presented on that occasion. Jeremiah took advantage of the occasion, and sent with Seraiah a word of cheer to the exiles in Babylon, and an announcement of the doom in store for that guilty city. The roll containing this message (<reflink target="XXX">Jer. 50:1-8</reflink>) Seraiah was to read to the exiles, and then, after fixing a stone to it, was to throw it into the Euphrates, uttering, as it sank, the prayer recorded in Jer. 51:59-64. Babylon was at this time in the height of its glory, the greatest and most powerful monarchy in the world. Scarcely seventy years elapsed when the words of the prophet were all fulfilled. Jer. 51:59 is rendered in the Revised Version, "Now Seraiah was chief chamberlain," instead of "was a quiet prince," as in the Authorized Version.</description>

  <item id="Seraphim">
    <description>mentioned in Isa. 6:2, 3, 6, 7. This word means fiery ones, in allusion, as is supposed, to their burning love. They are represented as "standing" above the King as he sat upon his throne, ready at once to minister unto him. Their form appears to have been human, with the addition of wings.

  <item id="Sergius Paulus">
    <description>a "prudent man" (R.V., "man of understanding"), the deputy (R.V., "proconsul") of Cyprus (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 13:6-13</reflink>). He became a convert to Christianity under Paul, who visited this island on his first mission to the heathen.</description>
    <description>A remarkable memorial of this proconsul was recently (1887) discovered at Rome. On a boundary stone of Claudius his name is found, among others, as having been appointed (A.D. 47) one of the curators of the banks and the channel of the river Tiber. After serving his three years as proconsul at Cyprus, he returned to Rome, where he held the office referred to. As he is not saluted in Paul's letter to the Romans, he probably died before it was written.</description>

  <item id="Sermon on the mount">
    <description>After spending a night in solemn meditation and prayer in the lonely mountain-range to the west of the Lake of Galilee (<reflink target="XXX">Luke 6:12</reflink>), on the following morning our Lord called to him his disciples, and from among them chose twelve, who were to be henceforth trained to be his apostles (<reflink target="XXX">Mark 3:14, 15</reflink>). After this solemn consecration of the twelve, he descended from the mountain-peak to a more level spot (<reflink target="XXX">Luke 6:17</reflink>), and there he sat down and delivered the "sermon on the mount" (Matt. 5-7; Luke 6:20-49) to the assembled multitude. The mountain here spoken of was probably that known by the name of the "Horns of Hattin" (Kurun Hattin), a ridge running east and west, not far from Capernaum. It was afterwards called the "Mount of Beatitudes."</description>

  <item id="Serpent">
    <description>(Heb. nahash; Gr. ophis), frequently noticed in Scripture. More than forty species are found in Syria and Arabia. The poisonous character of the serpent is alluded to in Jacob's blessing on Dan (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 49:17; see Prov. 30:18, 19; James 3:7; Jer. 8:17</reflink>). (<see target="x-self">See ADDER.</see>)</description>
    <description>This word is used symbolically of a deadly, subtle, malicious enemy (<reflink target="XXX">Luke 10:19</reflink>).</description>
    <description>The serpent is first mentioned in connection with the history of the temptation and fall of our first parents (Gen. 3). It has been well remarked regarding this temptation: "A real serpent was the agent of the temptation, as is plain from what is said of the natural characteristic of the serpent in the first verse of the chapter (3:1), and from the curse pronounced upon the animal itself. But that Satan was the actual tempter, and that he used the serpent merely as his instrument, is evident (1) from the nature of the transaction; for although the serpent may be the most subtle of all the beasts of the field, yet he has not the high intellectual faculties which the tempter here displayed. (2.) In the New Testament it is both directly asserted and in various forms assumed that Satan seduced our first parents into sin (<reflink target="XXX">John 8:44; Rom. 16:20; 2 Cor. 11:3, 14; Rev. 12:9; 20:2</reflink>)."

  <item id="Serpent, Fiery">
    <description>(LXX. "deadly," Vulg. "burning"), Num. 21:6, probably the naja haje of Egypt; some swift-springing, deadly snake (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 14:29</reflink>). After setting out from their encampment at Ezion-gaber, the Israelites entered on a wide sandy desert, which stretches from the mountains of Edom as far as the Persian Gulf. While traversing this region, the people began to murmur and utter loud complaints against Moses. As a punishment, the Lord sent serpents among them, and much people of Israel died. Moses interceded on their behalf, and by divine direction he made a "brazen serpent," and raised it on a pole in the midst of the camp, and all the wounded Israelites who looked on it were at once healed. (<reflink target="XXX">Comp. John 3:14, 15.</reflink>) (<see target="x-self">See ASP.</see>) This "brazen serpent" was preserved by the Israelites till the days of Hezekiah, when it was destroyed (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 18:4</reflink>).

  <item id="Seven">
    <description>This number occurs frequently in Scripture, and in such connections as lead to the supposition that it has some typical meaning. On the seventh day God rested, and hallowed it (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 2:2, 3</reflink>). The division of time into weeks of seven days each accounts for many instances of the occurrence of this number. This number has been called the symbol of perfection, and also the symbol of rest. "Jacob's seven years' service to Laban; Pharaoh's seven fat oxen and seven lean ones; the seven branches of the golden candlestick; the seven trumpets and the seven priests who sounded them; the seven days' siege of Jericho; the seven churches, seven spirits, seven stars, seven seals, seven vials, and many others, sufficiently prove the importance of this sacred number" (<reflink target="XXX">see Lev. 25:4; 1 Sam. 2:5; Ps. 12:6; 79:12; Prov. 26:16; Isa. 4:1; Matt. 18:21, 22; Luke 17:4</reflink>). The feast of Passover (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 12:15, 16</reflink>), the feast of Weeks (<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 16:9</reflink>), of Tabernacles (13:15), and the Jubilee (<reflink target="XXX">Lev. 25:8</reflink>), were all ordered by seven. Seven is the number of sacrifice (<reflink target="XXX">2 Chr. 29:21; Job 42:8</reflink>), of purification and consecration (<reflink target="XXX">Lev. 42:6, 17; 8:11, 33; 14:9, 51</reflink>), of forgiveness (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 18:21, 22; Luke 17:4</reflink>), of reward (<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 28:7; 1 Sam. 2:5</reflink>), and of punishment (<reflink target="XXX">Lev. 26:21, 24, 28; Deut. 28:25</reflink>). It is used for any round number in such passages as Job 5:19; Prov. 26:16, 25; Isa. 4:1; Matt. 12:45. It is used also to mean "abundantly" (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 4:15, 24; Lev. 26:24; Ps. 79:12</reflink>).</description>

  <item id="Seventy weeks">
    <description>a prophetic period mentioned in Dan. 9:24, and usually interpreted on the "year-day" theory, i.e., reckoning each day for a year. This period will thus represent 490 years. This is regarded as the period which would elapse till the time of the coming of the Messiah, dating "from the going forth of the commandment to restore and rebuild Jerusalem" i.e., from the close of the Captivity.</description>

He and his two companions refused to bow down before the image which Nebuchadnezzar had set up on the plains of Dura. Their conduct filled the king with the greatest fury, and he commanded them to be cast into the burning fiery furnace. Here, amid the fiery flames, they were miraculously preserved from harm. Over them the fire had no power, "neither was a hair of their head singed, neither had the smell of fire passed on them." Thus Nebuchadnezzar learned the greatness of the God of Israel.

He assumed the crown under the name of Jehoahaz (q.v.). He did not imitate the example of his father (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 23:32</reflink>), but was "a young lion, and it learned to catch the prey; it devoured men" (<reflink target="XXX">Ezek. 19:3</reflink>). His policy was anti-Egyptian therefore. Necho, at that time at Riblah, sent an army against Jerusalem, which at once yielded, and Jehoahaz was carried captive to the Egyptian camp, Eliakim being appointed king in his stead. He remained a captive in Egypt till his death, and was the first king of Judah that died in exile.</description>

    <description>an Assyrian king (<reflink target="XXX">Hos. 10:14</reflink>), identified with Shalmaneser II. (Sayce) or IV. (Lenormant), the successor of Pul on the throne of Assyria (B.C. 728). He made war against Hoshea, the king of Israel, whom he subdued and compelled to pay an annual tribute. Hoshea, however, soon after rebelled against his Assyrian conquerer. Shalmaneser again marched against Samaria, which, after a siege of three years, was taken (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 17:3-5; 18:9</reflink>) by Sargon (q.v.). A revolution meantime had broken out in Assyria, and Shalmaneser was deposed. Sargon usurped the vacant throne.

    <description>(4.) Heb. id. A kingdom in Arabia Felix. Sheba, in fact, was Saba in Southern Arabia, the Sabaeans of classical geography, who carried on the trade in spices with the other peoples of the ancient world. They were Semites, speaking one of the two main dialects of Himyaritic or South Arabic. Sheba had become a monarchy before the days of Solomon. Its queen brought him gold, spices, and precious stones (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 10:1-13</reflink>).

When David was returning to Jerusalem after the defeat of Absalom, a strife arose between the ten tribes and the tribe of Judah, because the latter took the lead in bringing back the king. Sheba took advantage of this state of things, and raised the standard of revolt, proclaiming, "We have no part in David." With his followers he proceeded northward. David seeing it necessary to check this revolt, ordered Abishai to take the gibborim, "mighty men," and the body-guard and such troops as he could gather, and pursue Sheba. Joab joined the expedition, and having treacherously put Amasa to death, assumed the command of the army. Sheba took refuge in Abel-Bethmaachah, a fortified town some miles north of Lake Merom. While Joab was engaged in laying siege to this city, Sheba's head was, at the instigation of a "wise woman" who had held a parley with him from the city walls, thrown over the wall to the besiegers, and thus the revolt came to an end.</description>

It is conjectured that "Shebna the scribe," who was one of those whom the king sent to confer with the Assyrian ambassador (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 18:18, 26, 37; 19:2; Isa. 36:3, 11, 22; 37:2</reflink>), was a different person.</description>

    <description>(3.) A city in Samaria (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 33:18</reflink>), called also Sichem (12:6), Sychem (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 7:16</reflink>). It stood in the narrow sheltered valley between Ebal on the north and Gerizim on the south, these mountains at their base being only some 500 yards apart. Here Abraham pitched his tent and built his first altar in the Promised Land, and received the first divine promise (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 12:6, 7</reflink>). Here also Jacob "bought a parcel of a field at the hands of the children of Hamor" after his return from Mesopotamia, and settled with his household, which he purged from idolatry by burying the teraphim of his followers under an oak tree, which was afterwards called "the oak of the sorcerer" (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 33:19; 35:4; Judg. 9:37</reflink>). (<see target="x-self">See MEONENIM.</see>) Here too, after a while, he dug a well, which bears his name to this day (<reflink target="XXX">John 4:5, 39-42</reflink>). To Shechem Joshua gathered all Israel "before God," and delivered to them his second parting address (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 24:1-15</reflink>). He "made a covenant with the people that day" at the very place where, on first entering the land, they had responded to the law from Ebal and Gerizim (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 24:25</reflink>), the terms of which were recorded "in the book of the law of God", i.e., in the roll of the law of Moses; and in memory of this solemn transaction a great stone was set up "under an oak" (<reflink target="XXX">comp. Gen. 28:18; 31:44-48; Ex. 24:4; Josh. 4:3, 8, 9</reflink>), possibly the old "oak of Moreh," as a silent witness of the transaction to all coming time.</description>
    <description>Shechem became one of the cities of refuge, the central city of refuge for Western Palestine (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 20:7</reflink>), and here the bones of Joseph were buried (24:32). Rehoboam was appointed king in Shechem (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 12:1, 19</reflink>), but Jeroboam afterwards took up his residence here. This city is mentioned in connection with our Lord's conversation with the woman of Samaria (<reflink target="XXX">John 4:5</reflink>); and thus, remaining as it does to the present day, it is one of the oldest cities of the world. It is the modern Nablus, a contraction for Neapolis, the name given to it by Vespasian. It lies about a mile and a half up the valley on its southern slope, and on the north of Gerizim, which rises about 1,100 feet above it, and is about 34 miles north of Jerusalem. It contains about 10,000 inhabitants, of whom about 160 are Samaritans and 100 Jews, the rest being Christians and Mohammedans.</description>
    <description>The site of Shechem is said to be of unrivalled beauty. Stanley says it is "the most beautiful, perhaps the only very beautiful, spot in Central Palestine."</description>
    <description>Gaza, near Shechem, only mentioned 1 Chr. 7:28, has entirely disappeared. It was destroyed at the time of the Conquest, and its place was taken by Shechem. (<see target="x-self">See SYCHAR.</see>)</description>

  <item id="Shechinah">
    <description>a Chaldee word meaning resting-place, not found in Scripture, but used by the later Jews to designate the visible symbol of God's presence in the tabernacle, and afterwards in Solomon's temple. When the Lord led Israel out of Egypt, he went before them "in a pillar of a cloud." This was the symbol of his presence with his people. For references made to it during the wilderness wanderings, see Ex. 14:20; 40:34-38; Lev. 9:23, 24; Num. 14:10; 16:19, 42.</description>
    <description>It is probable that after the entrance into Canaan this glory-cloud settled in the tabernacle upon the ark of the covenant in the most holy place.

After the Exodus, and as a result of intercourse with surrounding nations, other species were no doubt introduced into the herds of the people of Israel. They are frequently mentioned in Scripture. The care of a shepherd over his flock is referred to as illustrating God's care over his people (<reflink target="XXX">Ps. 23:1, 2; 74:1; 77:20; Isa. 40:11; 53:6; John 10:1-5, 7-16</reflink>).</description>

The tails are indeed huge masses of fat" (Geikie's Holy Land, etc.). The tail was no doubt the "rump" so frequently referred to in the Levitical sacrifices (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 29:22; Lev. 3:9; 7:3; 9:19</reflink>). Sheep-shearing was generally an occasion of great festivity (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 31:19; 38:12, 13; 1 Sam. 25:4-8, 36; 2 Sam. 13:23-28</reflink>).</description>

The "shekel of the sanctuary" (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 30:13; Num. 3:47</reflink>) was equal to twenty gerahs (<reflink target="XXX">Ezek. 45:12</reflink>). There were shekels of gold (<reflink target="XXX">1 Chr. 21:25</reflink>), of silver (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 9:8</reflink>), of brass (17:5), and of iron (7). When it became a coined piece of money, the shekel of gold was equivalent to about 2 pound of our money. Six gold shekels, according to the later Jewish system, were equal in value to fifty silver ones.</description>
    <description>The temple contribution, with which the public sacrifices were bought (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 30:13; 2 Chr. 24:6</reflink>), consisted of one common shekel, or a sanctuary half-shekel, equal to two Attic drachmas.

Shem's name is generally mentioned first in the list of Noah's sons. He and his wife were saved in the ark (7:13). Noah foretold his preeminence over Canaan (9:23-27).

    <description>The duties of a shepherd in an unenclosed country like Palestine were very onerous. "In early morning he led forth the flock from the fold, marching at its head to the spot where they were to be pastured. Here he watched them all day, taking care that none of the sheep strayed, and if any for a time eluded his watch and wandered away from the rest, seeking diligently till he found and brought it back. In those lands sheep require to be supplied regularly with water, and the shepherd for this purpose has to guide them either to some running stream or to wells dug in the wilderness and furnished with troughs. At night he brought the flock home to the fold, counting them as they passed under the rod at the door to assure himself that none were missing. Nor did his labours always end with sunset. Often he had to guard the fold through the dark hours from the attack of wild beasts, or the wily attempts of the prowling thief (see 1 Sam. 17:34).", Deane's David.</description>

Here the tabernacle was set up after the Conquest (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 18:1-10</reflink>), where it remained during all the period of the judges till the ark fell into the hands of the Philistines. "No spot in Central Palestine could be more secluded than this early sanctuary, nothing more featureless than the landscape around; so featureless, indeed, the landscape and so secluded the spot that from the time of St. Jerome till its re-discovery by Dr. Robinson in 1838 the very site was forgotten and unknown."

David forgave him; but on his death-bed he gave Solomon special instructions regarding Shimei, of whose fidelity he seems to have been in doubt (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 2:8,9</reflink>).

The name occurs later in Jewish history (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 11:11; Zech. 5:11</reflink>). Shinar was apparently first peopled by Turanian tribes, who tilled the land and made bricks and built cities. Then tribes of Semites invaded the land and settled in it, and became its rulers. This was followed in course of time by an Elamite invasion; from which the land was finally delivered by Khammurabi, the son of Amarpel ("Amraphel, king of Shinar," Gen. 14:1), who became the founder of the new empire of Chaldea.

His reign was one of great national success, and a record of his wars and conquests adorns the portico of what are called the "Bubastite kings" at Karnak, the ancient Thebes. Among these conquests is a record of that of Judea. In the fifth year of Rehoboam's reign Shishak came up against the kingdom of Judah with a powerful army. He took the fenced cities and came to Jerusalem. He pillaged the treasures of the temple and of the royal palace, and carried away the shields of gold which Solomon had made (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 11:40; 14:25; 2 Chr. 12:2</reflink>).

A slightly different form of the tree, equally common under the name of _seyal_, is the ancient 'shittah,' or, as more usually expressed in the plural form, the 'shittim,' of which the tabernacle was made."

    <description>a lily, the Susa of Greek and Roman writers, once the capital of Elam.

Once a magnificent city, it is now an immense mass of ruins. Here Daniel saw one of his visions (Dan. 8); and here also Nehemiah (Neh. 1) began his public life. Most of the events recorded in the Book of Esther took place here. Modern explorers have brought to light numerous relics, and the ground-plan of the splendid palace of Shushan, one of the residences of the great king, together with numerous specimens of ancient art, which illustrate the statements of Scripture regarding it (<reflink target="XXX">Dan. 8:2</reflink>). The great hall of this palace (Esther 1) "consisted of several magnificent groups of columns, together with a frontage of 343 feet 9 inches, and a depth of 244 feet. These groups were arranged into a central phalanx of thirty-six columns (six rows of six each), flanked on the west, north, and east by an equal number, disposed in double rows of six each, and distant from them 64 feet 2 inches." The inscriptions on the ruins represent that the palace was founded by Darius and completed by Artaxerxes.</description>

God afterwards, on account of their wickedness, "overthrew those cities, and all the plain, and all the inhabitants of the cities;" and the smoke of their destruction "went up as the smoke of a furnace" (19:24-28), and was visible from Mamre, where Abraham dwelt.</description>

    <description>When digging a shaft close to the south wall of the temple area, the engineers of the Palestine Exploration Fund, at a depth of 12 feet below the surface, came upon a pavement of polished stones, formerly one of the streets of the city. Under this pavement they found a stratum of 16 feet of concrete, and among this concrete, 10 feet down, they found a signet stone bearing the inscription, in Old Hebrew characters, "Haggai, son of Shebaniah." It has been asked, Might not this be the actual seal of Haggai the prophet? We know that he was in Jerusalem after the Captivity; and it is somewhat singular that he alone of all the minor prophets makes mention of a signet (<reflink target="XXX">Hag. 2:23</reflink>).

    <description>striking down. The whole country on the east of Jordan, from the Arnon to the Jabbok, was possessed by the Amorites, whose king, Sihon, refused to permit the Israelites to pass through his territory, and put his army in array against them. The Israelites went forth against him to battle, and gained a complete victory. The Amorites were defeated; Sihon, his sons, and all his people were smitten with the sword, his walled towns were captured, and the entire country of the Amorites was taken possession of by the Israelites (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 21:21-30; Deut. 2:24-37</reflink>).</description>
    <description>The country from the Jabbok to Hermon was at this time ruled by Og, the last of the Rephaim. He also tried to prevent the progress of the Israelites, but was utterly routed, and all his cities and territory fell into the hands of the Israelites (<reflink target="XXX">comp.

    <description>These two victories gave the Israelites possession of the country on the east of Jordan, from the Arnon to the foot of Hermon. The kingdom of Sihon embraced about 1,500 square miles, while that of Og was more than 3,000 square miles.</description>

    <description>The water which flows into this pool intermittingly by a subterranean channel springs from the "Fountain of the Virgin" (q.v.). The length of this channel, which has several windings, is 1,750 feet, though the direct distance is only 1,100 feet. The pool is 53 feet in length from north to south, 18 feet wide, and 19 deep. The water passes from it by a channel cut in the rock into the gardens below. (<see target="x-self">See EN-ROGEL.</see>)</description>
    <description>Many years ago (1880) a youth, while wading up the conduit by which the water enters the pool, accidentally discovered an inscription cut in the rock, on the eastern side, about 19 feet from the pool. This is the oldest extant Hebrew record of the kind. It has with great care been deciphered by scholars, and has been found to be an account of the manner in which the tunnel was constructed. Its whole length is said to be "twelve hundred cubits;" and the inscription further notes that the workmen, like the excavators of the Mont Cenis Tunnel, excavated from both ends, meeting in the middle.</description>
    <description>Some have argued that the inscription was cut in the time of Solomon; others, with more probability, refer it to the reign of Hezekiah. A more ancient tunnel was discovered in 1889 some 20 feet below the ground. It is of smaller dimensions, but more direct in its course. It is to this tunnel that Isaiah (8:6) probably refers.</description>
    <description>The Siloam inscription above referred to was surreptitiously cut from the wall of the tunnel in 1891 and broken into fragments. These were, however, recovered by the efforts of the British Consul at Jerusalem, and have been restored to their original place.</description>

    <description>As illustrative of the movement of small bands of Canaanites from place to place, and the intermingling of Canaanites and Israelites even in small towns in earlier times, M.C. Ganneau records the following curious fact: "Among the inhabitants of the village (of Siloam) there are a hundred or so domiciled for the most part in the lower quarter, and forming a group apart from the rest, called Dhiabrye, i.e., men of Dhiban. It appears that at some remote period a colony from the capital of king Mesha (Dibon-Moab) crossed the Jordan and fixed itself at the gates of Jerusalem at Silwan. The memory of this migration is still preserved; and I am assured by the people themselves that many of their number are installed in other villages round Jerusalem" (quoted by Henderson, Palestine).</description>

This word "Canaanite" does not mean a native of Canaan, but is derived from the Syriac word Kanean or Kaneniah, which was the name of a Jewish sect. The Revised Version has "Cananaean;" marg., "or Zealot" He is also called "Zelotes" (<reflink target="XXX">Luke 6:15; Acts 1:13; R.V., "the Zealot"</reflink>), because previous to his call to the apostleship he had been a member of the fanatical sect of the Zealots.

    <description>(6.) A Jew of Cyrene, in North Africa, then a province of Libya. A hundred thousand Jews from Palestine had been settled in this province by Ptolemy Soter (B.C. 323-285), where by this time they had greatly increased in number. They had a synagogue in Jerusalem for such of their number as went thither to the annual feasts. Simon was seized by the soldiers as the procession wended its way to the place of crucifixion as he was passing by, and the heavy cross which Christ from failing strength could no longer bear was laid on his shoulders. Perhaps they seized him because he showed sympathy with Jesus. He was the "father of Alexander and Rufus" (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 27:32</reflink>). Possibly this Simon may have been one of the "men of Cyrene" who preached the word to the Greeks (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 11:20</reflink>).</description>

He afterwards became a professed convert to the faith under the preaching of Philip the deacon and evangelist (12, 13). His profession was, however, soon found to be hollow. His conduct called forth from Peter a stern rebuke (8:18-23). From this moment he disappears from the Church's history. The term "Simony," as denoting the purchase for money of spiritual offices, is derived from him.</description>

  <item id="Sin">
    <description>is "any want of conformity unto or transgression of the law of God" (<reflink target="XXX">1 John 3:4; Rom. 4:15</reflink>), in the inward state and habit of the soul, as well as in the outward conduct of the life, whether by omission or commission (<reflink target="XXX">Rom. 6:12-17; 7:5-24</reflink>). It is "not a mere violation of the law of our constitution, nor of the system of things, but an offence against a personal lawgiver and moral governor who vindicates his law with penalties. The soul that sins is always conscious that his sin is (1) intrinsically vile and polluting, and (2) that it justly deserves punishment, and calls down the righteous wrath of God. Hence sin carries with it two inalienable characters, (1) ill-desert, guilt (reatus); and (2) pollution (macula).", Hodge's Outlines.</description>
    <description>The moral character of a man's actions is determined by the moral state of his heart. The disposition to sin, or the habit of the soul that leads to the sinful act, is itself also sin (<reflink target="XXX">Rom. 6:12-17; Gal. 5:17; James 1:14, 15</reflink>).</description>
    <description>The origin of sin is a mystery, and must for ever remain such to us. It is plain that for some reason God has permitted sin to enter this world, and that is all we know. His permitting it, however, in no way makes God the author of sin.</description>
    <description>Adam's sin (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 3:1-6</reflink>) consisted in his yielding to the assaults of temptation and eating the forbidden fruit. It involved in it, (1) the sin of unbelief, virtually making God a liar; and (2) the guilt of disobedience to a positive command. By this sin he became an apostate from God, a rebel in arms against his Creator. He lost the favour of God and communion with him; his whole nature became depraved, and he incurred the penalty involved in the covenant of works.</description>
    <description>Original sin. "Our first parents being the root of all mankind, the guilt of their sin was imputed, and the same death in sin and corrupted nature were conveyed to all their posterity, descending from them by ordinary generation." Adam was constituted by God the federal head and representative of all his posterity, as he was also their natural head, and therefore when he fell they fell with him (<reflink target="XXX">Rom. 5:12-21; 1 Cor. 15:22-45</reflink>). His probation was their probation, and his fall their fall. Because of Adam's first sin all his posterity came into the world in a state of sin and condemnation, i.e., (1) a state of moral corruption, and (2) of guilt, as having judicially imputed to them the guilt of Adam's first sin.</description>
    <description>"Original sin" is frequently and properly used to denote only the moral corruption of their whole nature inherited by all men from Adam. This inherited moral corruption consists in, (1) the loss of original righteousness; and (2) the presence of a constant proneness to evil, which is the root and origin of all actual sin. It is called "sin" (<reflink target="XXX">Rom. 6:12, 14, 17; 7:5-17</reflink>), the "flesh" (<reflink target="XXX">Gal. 5:17, 24</reflink>), "lust" (<reflink target="XXX">James 1:14, 15</reflink>), the "body of sin" (<reflink target="XXX">Rom. 6:6</reflink>), "ignorance," "blindness of heart," "alienation from the life of God" (<reflink target="XXX">Eph. 4:18, 19</reflink>). It influences and depraves the whole man, and its tendency is still downward to deeper and deeper corruption, there remaining no recuperative element in the soul. It is a total depravity, and it is also universally inherited by all the natural descendants of Adam (<reflink target="XXX">Rom. 3:10-23; 5:12-21; 8:7</reflink>). Pelagians deny original sin, and regard man as by nature morally and spiritually well; semi-Pelagians regard him as morally sick; Augustinians, or, as they are also called, Calvinists, regard man as described above, spiritually dead (<reflink target="XXX">Eph. 2:1; 1 John 3:14</reflink>).</description>
    <description>The doctrine of original sin is proved, (1.) From the fact of the universal sinfulness of men. "There is no man that sinneth not" (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 8:46; Isa. 53:6; Ps. 130:3; Rom. 3:19, 22, 23; Gal. 3:22</reflink>). (2.) From the total depravity of man. All men are declared to be destitute of any principle of spiritual life; man's apostasy from God is total and complete (<reflink target="XXX">Job 15:14-16; Gen. 6:5,6</reflink>). (3.) From its early manifestation (<reflink target="XXX">Ps. 58:3; Prov. 22:15</reflink>). (4.) It is proved also from the necessity, absolutely and universally, of regeneration (<reflink target="XXX">John 3:3; 2 Cor. 5:17</reflink>). (5.) From the universality of death (<reflink target="XXX">Rom. 5:12-20</reflink>).</description>
    <description>Various kinds of sin are mentioned, (1.) "Presumptuous sins," or as literally rendered, "sins with an uplifted hand", i.e., defiant acts of sin, in contrast with "errors" or "inadvertencies" (<reflink target="XXX">Ps. 19:13</reflink>). (2.) "Secret", i.e., hidden sins (19:12); sins which escape the notice of the soul. (3.) "Sin against the Holy Ghost" (q.v.), or a "sin unto death" (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 12:31, 32; 1 John 5:16</reflink>), which amounts to a wilful rejection of grace.</description>
    <description>Sin, a city in Egypt, called by the Greeks Pelusium, which means, as does also the Hebrew name, "clayey" or "muddy," so called from the abundance of clay found there. It is called by Ezekel (<reflink target="XXX">Ezek. 30:15</reflink>) "the strength of Egypt, "thus denoting its importance as a fortified city. It has been identified with the modern Tineh, "a miry place," where its ruins are to be found. Of its boasted magnificence only four red granite columns remain, and some few fragments of others.</description>

  <item id="Sin-offering">
    <description>(Heb. hattath), the law of, is given in detail in Lev. 4-6:13; 9:7-11, 22-24; 12:6-8; 15:2, 14, 25-30; 14:19, 31; Num. 6:10-14. On the day of Atonement it was made with special solemnity (<reflink target="XXX">Lev. 16:5, 11, 15</reflink>). The blood was then carried into the holy of holies and sprinkled on the mercy-seat. Sin-offerings were also presented at the five annual festivals (Num. 28, 29), and on the occasion of the consecration of the priests (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 29:10-14, 36</reflink>). As each individual, even the most private member of the congregation, as well as the congregation at large, and the high priest, was obliged, on being convicted by his conscience of any particular sin, to come with a sin-offering, we see thus impressively disclosed the need in which every sinner stands of the salvation of Christ, and the necessity of making application to it as often as the guilt of sin renews itself upon his conscience. This resort of faith to the perfect sacrifice of Christ is the one way that lies open for the sinner's attainment of pardon and restoration to peace. And then in the sacrifice itself there is the reality of that incomparable worth and preciousness which were so significantly represented in the sin-offering by the sacredness of its blood and the hallowed destination of its flesh. With reference to this the blood of Christ is called emphatically "the precious blood," and the blood that "cleanseth from all sin" (<reflink target="XXX">1 John 1:7</reflink>).</description>

  <item id="Sinai">
    <description>of Sin (the moon god), called also Horeb, the name of the mountain district which was reached by the Hebrews in the third month after the Exodus. Here they remained encamped for about a whole year. Their journey from the Red Sea to this encampment, including all the windings of the route, was about 150 miles. The last twenty-two chapters of Exodus, together with the whole of Leviticus and Num. ch. 1-11, contain a record of all the transactions which occurred while they were here. From Rephidim (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 17:8-13</reflink>) the Israelites journeyed forward through the Wady Solaf and Wady esh-Sheikh into the plain of er-Rahah, "the desert of Sinai," about 2 miles long and half a mile broad, and encamped there "before the mountain." The part of the mountain range, a protruding lower bluff, known as the Ras Sasafeh (Sufsafeh), rises almost perpendicularly from this plain, and is in all probability the Sinai of history. Dean Stanley thus describes the scene:, "The plain itself is not broken and uneven and narrowly shut in, like almost all others in the range, but presents a long retiring sweep, within which the people could remove and stand afar off. The cliff, rising like a huge altar in front of the whole congregation, and visible against the sky in lonely grandeur from end to end of the whole plain, is the very image of the 'mount that might be touched,' and from which the voice of God might be heard far and wide over the plain below." This was the scene of the giving of the law. From the Ras Sufsafeh the law was proclaimed to the people encamped below in the plain of er-Rahah. During the lengthened period of their encampment here the Israelites passed through a very memorable experience. An immense change passed over them. They are now an organized nation, bound by covenant engagement to serve the Lord their God, their ever-present divine Leader and Protector. At length, in the second month of the second year of the Exodus, they move their camp and march forward according to a prescribed order. After three days they reach the "wilderness of Paran," the "et-Tih", i.e., "the desert", and here they make their first encampment. At this time a spirit of discontent broke out amongst them, and the Lord manifested his displeasure by a fire which fell on the encampment and inflicted injury on them. Moses called the place Taberah (q.v.), Num. 11:1-3. The journey between Sinai and the southern boundary of the Promised Land (about 150 miles) at Kadesh was accomplished in about a year.

  <item id="Sinaiticus codex">
    <description>usually designated by the first letter of the Hebrew alphabet, is one of the most valuable of ancient MSS. of the Greek New Testament. On the occasion of a third visit to the convent of St. Catherine, on Mount Sinai, in 1859, it was discovered by Dr. Tischendorf. He had on a previous visit in 1844 obtained forty-three parchment leaves of the LXX., which he deposited in the university library of Leipsic, under the title of the Codex Frederico-Augustanus, after his royal patron the king of Saxony. In the year referred to (1859) the emperor of Russia sent him to prosecute his search for MSS., which he was convinced were still to be found in the Sinai convent. The story of his finding the manuscript of the New Testament has all the interest of a romance. He reached the convent on 31st January; but his inquiries appeared to be fruitless. On the 4th February he had resolved to return home without having gained his object. "On that day, when walking with the provisor of the convent, he spoke with much regret of his ill-success. Returning from their promenade, Tischendorf accompanied the monk to his room, and there had displayed to him what his companion called a copy of the LXX., which he, the ghostly brother, owned. The MS. was wrapped up in a piece of cloth, and on its being unrolled, to the surprise and delight of the critic the very document presented itself which he had given up all hope of seeing. His object had been to complete the fragmentary LXX. of 1844, which he had declared to be the most ancient of all Greek codices on vellum that are extant; but he found not only that, but a copy of the Greek New Testament attached, of the same age, and perfectly complete, not wanting a single page or paragraph." This precious fragment, after some negotiations, he obtained possession of, and conveyed it to the Emperor Alexander, who fully appreciated its importance, and caused it to be published as nearly as possible in facsimile, so as to exhibit correctly the ancient handwriting. The entire codex consists of 346 1/2 folios. Of these 199 belong to the Old Testament and 147 1/2 to the New, along with two ancient documents called the Epistle of Barnabas and the Shepherd of Hermas. The books of the New Testament stand thus: the four Gospels, the epistles of Paul, the Acts of the Apostles, the Catholic Epistles, the Apocalypse of John. It is shown by Tischendorf that this codex was written in the fourth century, and is thus of about the same age as the Vatican codex; but while the latter wants the greater part of Matthew and sundry leaves here and there besides, the Sinaiticus is the only copy of the New Testament in uncial characters which is complete. Thus it is the oldest extant MS. copy of the New Testament. Both the Vatican and the Sinai codices were probably written in Egypt. (<see target="x-self">See VATICANUS.</see>)</description>

After all was lost he fled to the settlement of Heber the Kenite in the plain of Zaanaim. Jael, Heber's wife, received him into her tent with apparent hospitality, and "gave him butter" (i.e., lebben, or curdled milk) "in a lordly dish." Having drunk the refreshing beverage, he lay down, and soon sank into the sleep of the weary. While he lay asleep Jael crept stealthily up to him, and taking in her hand one of the tent pegs, with a mallet she drove it with such force through his temples that it entered into the ground where he lay, and "at her feet he bowed, he fell; where he bowed, there he fell down dead." The part of Deborah's song (<reflink target="XXX">Judg. 5:24-27</reflink>) referring to the death of Sisera (which is a "mere patriotic outburst," and "is no proof that purer eyes would have failed to see gross sin mingling with Jael's service to Israel") is thus rendered by Professor Roberts (Old Testament Revision):</description>
    <description>"Extolled above women be Jael, The wife of Heber the Kenite, Extolled above women in the tent. He asked for water, she gave him milk; She brought him cream in a lordly dish. She stretched forth her hand to the nail, Her right hand to the workman's hammer, And she smote Sisera; she crushed his head, She crashed through and transfixed his temples. At her feet he curled himself, he fell, he lay still; At her feet he curled himself, he fell; And where he curled himself, there he fell dead."</description>

    <description>the attitude generally assumed in Palestine by those who were engaged in any kind of work. "The carpenter saws, planes, and hews with his hand-adze, sitting on the ground or upon the plank he is planning.

  <item id="Slave">
    <description>Jer. 2:14 (A.V.), but not there found in the original. In Rev. 18:13 the word "slaves" is the rendering of a Greek word meaning "bodies." The Hebrew and Greek words for slave are usually rendered simply "servant," "bondman," or "bondservant." Slavery as it existed under the Mosaic law has no modern parallel. That law did not originate but only regulated the already existing custom of slavery (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 21:20, 21, 26, 27; Lev. 25:44-46; Josh. 9:6-27</reflink>). The gospel in its spirit and genius is hostile to slavery in every form, which under its influence is gradually disappearing from among men.</description>

It was used by the Israelites in war (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 3:25</reflink>). (See ARMS</description>

The church founded here was one of the seven addressed by our Lord (<reflink target="XXX">Rev. 2:8-11</reflink>).

    <description>(2.) Heb. shablul (<reflink target="XXX">Ps. 58:8</reflink>), the snail or slug proper. Tristram explains the allusions of this passage by a reference to the heat and drought by which the moisture of the snail is evaporated. "We find," he says, "in all parts of the Holy Land myriads of snail-shells in fissures still adhering by the calcareous exudation round their orifice to the surface of the rock, but the animal of which is utterly shrivelled and wasted, 'melted away.'"</description>

  <item id="Snow">
    <description>Common in Palestine in winter (<reflink target="XXX">Ps. 147:16</reflink>). The snow on the tops of the Lebanon range is almost always within view throughout the whole year. The word is frequently used figuratively by the sacred writers (<reflink target="XXX">Job 24:19; Ps. 51:7; 68:14; Isa. 1:18</reflink>). It is mentioned only once in the historical books (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 23:20</reflink>). It was "carried to Tyre, Sidon, and Damascus as a luxury, and labourers sweltering in the hot harvest-fields used it for the purpose of cooling the water which they drank (<reflink target="XXX">Prov. 25:13; Jer. 18:14</reflink>). No doubt Herod Antipas, at his feasts in Tiberias, enjoyed also from this very source the modern luxury of ice-water."</description>

    <description>(Nubian, Sabako), an Ethiopian king who brought Egypt under his sway.

  <item id="Soap">
    <description>(<reflink target="XXX">Jer. 2:22; Mal. 3:2; Heb. borith</reflink>), properly a vegetable alkali, obtained from the ashes of certain plants, particularly the salsola kali (saltwort), which abounds on the shores of the Dead Sea and of the Mediterranean. It does not appear that the Hebrews were acquainted with what is now called "soap," which is a compound of alkaline carbonates with oleaginous matter. The word "purely" in Isa. 1:25 (R.V., "throughly;" marg., "as with lye") is lit. "as with _bor_." This word means "clearness," and hence also that which makes clear, or pure, alkali. "The ancients made use of alkali mingled with oil, instead of soap (<reflink target="XXX">Job 9:30</reflink>), and also in smelting metals, to make them melt and flow more readily and purely" (Gesenius).</description>

It lay on the northern side of the valley of Elah (Wady es-Sunt). It has been identified with the modern Khurbet Shuweikeh, about 14 miles south-west of Jerusalem. In this campaign Goliath was slain, and the Philistines were completely routed.</description>

  <item id="Sodom">
    <description>burning; the walled, a city in the vale of Siddim (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 13:10; 14:1-16</reflink>). The wickedness of its inhabitants brought down upon it fire from heaven, by which it was destroyed (18:16-33; 19:1-29; Deut. 23:17). This city and its awful destruction are frequently alluded to in Scripture (<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 29:23; 32:32; Isa. 1:9, 10; 3:9; 13:19; Jer. 23:14; Ezek. 16:46-56; Zeph. 2:9; Matt. 10:15; Rom. 9:29; 2 Pet. 2:6, etc.</reflink>). No trace of it or of the other cities of the plain has been discovered, so complete was their destruction. Just opposite the site of Zoar, on the south-west coast of the Dead Sea, is a range of low hills, forming a mass of mineral salt called Jebel Usdum, "the hill of Sodom." It has been concluded, from this and from other considerations, that the cities of the plain stood at the southern end of the Dead Sea. Others, however, with much greater probability, contend that they stood at the northern end of the sea. [in 1897].</description>

  <item id="Solomon">
    <description>peaceful, (Heb. Shelomoh), David's second son by Bathsheba, i.e., the first after their legal marriage (2 Sam. 12). He was probably born about B.C. 1035 (<reflink target="XXX">1 Chr. 22:5; 29:1</reflink>). He succeeded his father on the throne in early manhood, probably about sixteen or eighteen years of age. Nathan, to whom his education was intrusted, called him Jedidiah, i.e., "beloved of the Lord" (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 12:24, 25</reflink>). He was the first king of Israel "born in the purple." His father chose him as his successor, passing over the claims of his elder sons: "Assuredly Solomon my son shall reign after me." His history is recorded in 1 Kings 1-11 and 2 Chr. 1-9. His elevation to the throne took place before his father's death, and was hastened on mainly by Nathan and Bathsheba, in consequence of the rebellion of Adonijah (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 1:5-40</reflink>). During his long reign of forty years the Hebrew monarchy gained its highest splendour. This period has well been called the "Augustan age" of the Jewish annals. The first half of his reign was, however, by far the brighter and more prosperous; the latter half was clouded by the idolatries into which he fell, mainly from his heathen intermarriages (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 11:1-8; 14:21, 31</reflink>).</description>
    <description>Before his death David gave parting instructions to his son (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 2:1-9; 1 Chr. 22:7-16; 28</reflink>). As soon as he had settled himself in his kingdom, and arranged the affairs of his extensive empire, he entered into an alliance with Egypt by the marriage of the daughter of Pharaoh (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 3:1</reflink>), of whom, however, nothing further is recorded. He surrounded himself with all the luxuries and the external grandeur of an Eastern monarch, and his government prospered. He entered into an alliance with Hiram, king of Tyre, who in many ways greatly assisted him in his numerous undertakings. (See HIRAM</description>
    <description>For some years before his death David was engaged in the active work of collecting materials (<reflink target="XXX">1 Chr. 29:6-9; 2 Chr. 2:3-7</reflink>) for building a temple in Jerusalem as a permanent abode for the ark of the covenant. He was not permitted to build the house of God (<reflink target="XXX">1 Chr. 22:8</reflink>); that honour was reserved to his son Solomon. (<see target="x-self">See TEMPLE.</see>)</description>
    <description>After the completion of the temple, Solomon engaged in the erection of many other buildings of importance in Jerusalem and in other parts of his kingdom. For the long space of thirteen years he was engaged in the erection of a royal palace on Ophel (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 7:1-12</reflink>). It was 100 cubits long, 50 broad, and 30 high. Its lofty roof was supported by forty-five cedar pillars, so that the hall was like a forest of cedar wood, and hence probably it received the name of "The House of the Forest of Lebanon." In front of this "house" was another building, which was called the Porch of Pillars, and in front of this again was the "Hall of Judgment," or Throne-room (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 7:7; 10:18-20; 2 Chr. 9:17-19</reflink>), "the King's Gate," where he administered justice and gave audience to his people. This palace was a building of great magnificence and beauty. A portion of it was set apart as the residence of the queen consort, the daughter of Pharaoh. From the palace there was a private staircase of red and scented sandal wood which led up to the temple.</description>
    <description>Solomon also constructed great works for the purpose of securing a plentiful supply of water for the city (<reflink target="XXX">Eccl. 2:4-6</reflink>). He then built Millo (LXX., "Acra") for the defence of the city, completing a line of ramparts around it (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 9:15, 24; 11:27</reflink>). He erected also many other fortifications for the defence of his kingdom at various points where it was exposed to the assault of enemies (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 9:15-19; 2 Chr. 8:2-6</reflink>). Among his great undertakings must also be mentioned the building of Tadmor (q.v.) in the wilderness as a commercial depot, as well as a military outpost.</description>
    <description>During his reign Palestine enjoyed great commercial prosperity. Extensive traffic was carried on by land with Tyre and Egypt and Arabia, and by sea with Spain and India and the coasts of Africa, by which Solomon accumulated vast stores of wealth and of the produce of all nations (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 9:26-28; 10:11, 12; 2 Chr. 8:17, 18; 9:21</reflink>). This was the "golden age" of Israel. The royal magnificence and splendour of Solomon's court were unrivalled. He had seven hundred wives and three hundred concubines, an evidence at once of his pride, his wealth, and his sensuality. The maintenance of his household involved immense expenditure. The provision required for one day was "thirty measures of fine flour, and threescore measures of meal, ten fat oxen, and twenty oxen out of the pastures, and an hundred sheep, beside harts, and roebucks, and fallow-deer, and fatted fowl" (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 4:22, 23</reflink>).</description>
    <description>Solomon's reign was not only a period of great material prosperity, but was equally remarkable for its intellectual activity. He was the leader of his people also in this uprising amongst them of new intellectual life. "He spake three thousand proverbs: and his songs were a thousand and five. And he spake of trees, from the cedar tree that is in Lebanon even unto the hyssop that springeth out of the wall: he spake also of beasts, and of fowl, and of creeping things, and of fishes" (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 4:32, 33</reflink>).</description>
    <description>His fame was spread abroad through all lands, and men came from far and near "to hear the wisdom of Solomon." Among others thus attracted to Jerusalem was "the queen of the south" (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 12:42</reflink>), the queen of Sheba, a country in Arabia Felix. "Deep, indeed, must have been her yearning, and great his fame, which induced a secluded Arabian queen to break through the immemorial custom of her dreamy land, and to put forth the energy required for braving the burdens and perils of so long a journey across a wilderness. Yet this she undertook, and carried it out with safety." (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 10:1-13; 2 Chr. 9:1-12.</reflink>) She was filled with amazement by all she saw and heard: "there was no more spirit in her." After an interchange of presents she returned to her native land.</description>
    <description>But that golden age of Jewish history passed away. The bright day of Solomon's glory ended in clouds and darkness. His decline and fall from his high estate is a sad record. Chief among the causes of his decline were his polygamy and his great wealth. "As he grew older he spent more of his time among his favourites. The idle king living among these idle women, for 1,000 women, with all their idle and mischievous attendants, filled the palaces and pleasure-houses which he had built (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 11:3</reflink>), learned first to tolerate and then to imitate their heathenish ways. He did not, indeed, cease to believe in the God of Israel with his mind. He did not cease to offer the usual sacrifices in the temple at the great feasts. But his heart was not right with God; his worship became merely formal; his soul, left empty by the dying out of true religious fervour, sought to be filled with any religious excitement which offered itself. Now for the first time a worship was publicly set up amongst the people of the Lord which was not simply irregular or forbidden, like that of Gideon (<reflink target="XXX">Judg. 8:27</reflink>), or the Danites (<reflink target="XXX">Judg. 18:30, 31</reflink>), but was downright idolatrous." (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 11:7; 2 Kings 23:13.</reflink>)</description>
    <description>This brought upon him the divine displeasure. His enemies prevailed against him (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 11:14-22, 23-25, 26-40</reflink>), and one judgment after another fell upon the land. And now the end of all came, and he died, after a reign of forty years, and was buried in the city of David, and "with him was buried the short-lived glory and unity of Israel." "He leaves behind him but one weak and worthless son, to dismember his kingdom and disgrace his name."</description>
    <description>"The kingdom of Solomon," says Rawlinson, "is one of the most striking facts in the Biblical history. A petty nation, which for hundreds of years has with difficulty maintained a separate existence in the midst of warlike tribes, each of which has in turn exercised dominion over it and oppressed it, is suddenly raised by the genius of a soldier-monarch to glory and greatness. An empire is established which extends from the Euphrates to the borders of Egypt, a distance of 450 miles; and this empire, rapidly constructed, enters almost immediately on a period of peace which lasts for half a century. Wealth, grandeur, architectural magnificence, artistic excellence, commercial enterprise, a position of dignity among the great nations of the earth, are enjoyed during this space, at the end of which there is a sudden collapse. The ruling nation is split in twain, the subject-races fall off, the pre-eminence lately gained being wholly lost, the scene of struggle, strife, oppression, recovery, inglorious submission, and desperate effort, re-commences.", Historical Illustrations.</description>

  <item id="Solomon, Song of">
    <description>called also, after the Vulgate, the "Canticles." It is the "song of songs" (1:1), as being the finest and most precious of its kind; the noblest song, "das Hohelied," as Luther calls it. The Solomonic authorship of this book has been called in question, but evidences, both internal and external, fairly establish the traditional view that it is the product of Solomon's pen. It is an allegorical poem setting forth the mutual love of Christ and the Church, under the emblem of the bridegroom and the bride. (<reflink target="XXX">Compare Matt. 9:15; John 3:29; Eph. 5:23, 27, 29; Rev. 19:7-9; 21:2, 9; 22:17.

  <item id="Son of God">
    <description>The plural, "sons of God," is used (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 6:2, 4</reflink>) to denote the pious descendants of Seth. In Job 1:6; 38:7 this name is applied to the angels. Hosea uses the phrase (1:10) to designate the gracious relation in which men stand to God.</description>
    <description>In the New Testament this phrase frequently denotes the relation into which we are brought to God by adoption (<reflink target="XXX">Rom. 8:14, 19; 2 Cor. 6:18; Gal. 4:5, 6; Phil. 2:15; 1 John 3:1, 2</reflink>). It occurs thirty-seven times in the New Testament as the distinctive title of our Saviour. He does not bear this title in consequence of his miraculous birth, nor of his incarnation, his resurrection, and exaltation to the Father's right hand. This is a title of nature and not of office. The sonship of Christ denotes his equality with the Father. To call Christ the Son of God is to assert his true and proper divinity. The second Person of the Trinity, because of his eternal relation to the first Person, is the Son of God. He is the Son of God as to his divine nature, while as to his human nature he is the Son of David (<reflink target="XXX">Rom. 1:3, 4. Comp. Gal. 4:4; John 1:1-14; 5:18-25; 10:30-38, which prove that Christ was the Son of God before his incarnation, and that his claim to this title is a claim of equality with God</reflink>).</description>
    <description>When used with reference to creatures, whether men or angels, this word is always in the plural. In the singular it is always used of the second Person of the Trinity, with the single exception of Luke 3:38, where it is used of Adam.</description>

    <description>(2.) It is a title frequently given to the prophet Ezekiel, probably to remind him of his human weakness.</description>
    <description>(3.) In the New Testament it is used forty-three times as a distinctive title of the Saviour. In the Old Testament it is used only in Ps. 80:17 and Dan. 7:13 with this application. It denotes the true humanity of our Lord. He had a true body (<reflink target="XXX">Heb. 2:14; Luke 24:39</reflink>) and a rational soul. He was perfect man.</description>

  <item id="Sosthenes">
    <description>safe in strength, the chief ruler of the synagogue at Corinth, who was seized and beaten by the mob in the presence of Gallio, the Roman governor, when he refused to proceed against Paul at the instigation of the Jews (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 18:12-17</reflink>). The motives of this assault against Sosthenes are not recorded, nor is it mentioned whether it was made by Greeks or Romans. Some identify him, but without sufficient grounds, with one whom Paul calls "Sosthenes our brother," a convert to the faith (<reflink target="XXX">1 Cor. 1:1</reflink>).</description>

  <item id="South">
    <description>Heb. Negeb, that arid district to the south of Palestine through which lay the caravan route from Central Palestine to Egypt (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 12:9; 13:1, 3; 46:1-6</reflink>). "The Negeb comprised a considerable but irregularly-shaped tract of country, its main portion stretching from the mountains and lowlands of Judah in the north to the mountains of Azazemeh in the south, and from the Dead Sea and southern Ghoron the east to the Mediterranean on the west." In Ezek. 20:46 (21:1 in Heb.) three different Hebrew words are all rendered "south." (1) "Set thy face toward the south" (Teman, the region on the right, 1 Sam. 33:24); (2) "Drop thy word toward the south" (Negeb, the region of dryness, Josh. 15:4); (3) "Prophesy against the forest of the south field" (Darom, the region of brightness, Deut. 33:23). In Job 37:9 the word "south" is literally "chamber," used here in the sense of treasury (<reflink target="XXX">comp. 38:22; Ps. 135:7</reflink>). This verse is rendered in the Revised Version "out of the chamber of the south."</description>

  <item id="Spain">
    <description>Paul expresses his intention (<reflink target="XXX">Rom. 15:24, 28</reflink>) to visit Spain. There is, however, no evidence that he ever carried it into effect, although some think that he probably did so between his first and second imprisonment.

  <item id="Sparrow">
    <description>Mentioned among the offerings made by the very poor. Two sparrows were sold for a farthing (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 10:29</reflink>), and five for two farthings (<reflink target="XXX">Luke 12:6</reflink>). The Hebrew word thus rendered is _tsippor_, which properly denotes the whole family of small birds which feed on grain (<reflink target="XXX">Lev. 14:4; Ps. 84:3; 102:7</reflink>). The Greek word of the New Testament is _strouthion_ (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 10:29-31</reflink>), which is thus correctly rendered.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Spicery">
    <description>Heb. nechoth, identified with the Arabic naka'at, the gum tragacanth, obtained from the astralagus, of which there are about twenty species found in Palestine. The tragacanth of commerce is obtained from the A. tragacantha. "The gum exudes plentifully under the heat of the sun on the leaves, thorns, and exteremity of the twigs."</description>

  <item id="Spices">
    <description>aromatic substances, of which several are named in Ex. 30. They were used in the sacred anointing oil (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 25:6; 35:8; 1 Chr. 9:29</reflink>), and in embalming the dead (<reflink target="XXX">2 Chr. 16:14; Luke 23:56; 24:1; John 19:39, 40</reflink>).

  <item id="Spider">
    <description>The trust of the hypocrite is compared to the spider's web or house (<reflink target="XXX">Job 8:14</reflink>). It is said of the wicked by Isaiah that they "weave the spider's web" (59:5), i.e., their works and designs are, like the spider's web, vain and useless. The Hebrew word here used is _'akkabish_, "a swift weaver."</description>
    <description>In Prov. 30:28 a different Hebrew word (semamith) is used. It is rendered in the Vulgate by stellio, and in the Revised Version by "lizard." It may, however, represent the spider, of which there are, it is said, about seven hundred species in Palestine.</description>

  <item id="Spies">
    <description>When the Israelites reached Kadesh for the first time, and were encamped there, Moses selected twelve spies from among the chiefs of the divisions of the tribes, and sent them forth to spy the land of Canaan (Num. 13), and to bring back to him a report of its actual condition. They at once proceeded on their important errand, and went through the land as far north as the district round Lake Merom. After about six weeks' absence they returned. Their report was very discouraging, and the people were greatly alarmed, and in a rebellious spirit proposed to elect a new leader and return to Egypt. Only two of the spies, Caleb and Joshua, showed themselves on this occasion stout-hearted and faithful. All their appeals and remonstrances were in vain. Moses announced that as a punishment for their rebellion they must now wander in the wilderness till a new generation should arise which would go up and posses the land. The spies had been forty days absent on their expedition, and for each day the Israelites were to be wanderers for a year in the desert. (<see target="x-self">See ESHCOL.</see>)</description>
    <description>Two spies were sent by Joshua "secretly" i.e., unknown to the people (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 2:1</reflink>), "to view the land and Jericho" after the death of Moses, and just before the tribes under his leadership were about to cross the Jordan. They learned from Rahab (q.v.), in whose house they found a hiding-place, that terror had fallen on all the inhabitants of the land because of the great things they had heard that Jehovah had done for them (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 15:14-16; comp. 23:27; Deut. 2:25; 11:25</reflink>). As the result of their mission they reported: "Truly Jehovah hath delivered into our hands all the land; for even all the inhabitants of the country do faint because of us."</description>

  <item id="Spikenard">
    <description>(Heb. nerd), a much-valued perfume (<reflink target="XXX">Cant. 1:12; 4:13, 14</reflink>). It was "very precious", i.e., very costly (<reflink target="XXX">Mark 14:3; John 12:3,5</reflink>). It is the root of an Indian plant, the Nardostachys jatamansi, of the family of Valeriance, growing on the Himalaya mountains. It is distinguished by its having many hairy spikes shooting out from one root. It is called by the Arabs sunbul Hindi, "the Indian spike." In the New Testament this word is the rendering of the Greek nardos pistike. The margin of the Revised Version in these passages has "pistic nard," pistic being perhaps a local name. Some take it to mean genuine, and others liquid. The most probable opinion is that the word pistike designates the nard as genuine or faithfully prepared.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Spirit">
    <description>(Heb. ruah; Gr. pneuma), properly wind or breath. In 2 Thess. 2:8 it means "breath," and in Eccl. 8:8 the vital principle in man. It also denotes the rational, immortal soul by which man is distinguished (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 7:59; 1 Cor. 5:5; 6:20; 7:34</reflink>), and the soul in its separate state (<reflink target="XXX">Heb. 12:23</reflink>), and hence also an apparition (<reflink target="XXX">Job 4:15; Luke 24:37, 39</reflink>), an angel (<reflink target="XXX">Heb. 1:14</reflink>), and a demon (<reflink target="XXX">Luke 4:36; 10:20</reflink>). This word is used also metaphorically as denoting a tendency (<reflink target="XXX">Zech. 12:10; Luke 13:11</reflink>).</description>
    <description>In Rom. 1:4, 1 Tim. 3:16, 2 Cor. 3:17, 1 Pet. 3:18, it designates the divine nature.</description>

    <description>(Heb. 'ain, "the bright open source, the eye of the landscape"). To be carefully distinguished from "well" (q.v.). "Springs" mentioned in Josh. 10:40 (Heb.

    <description>(Heb. nataph), one of the components of the perfume which was offered on the golden altar (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 30:34; R.V. marg., "opobalsamum"</reflink>). The Hebrew word is from a root meaning "to distil," and it has been by some interpreted as distilled myrrh. Others regard it as the gum of the storax tree, or rather shrub, the Styrax officinale. "The Syrians value this gum highly, and use it medicinally as an emulcent in pectoral complaints, and also in perfumery."</description>

In Jer. 15:12 the same word is used, and is also rendered in the Revised Version "brass." But more correctly it is copper (q.v.), as brass in the ordinary sense of the word (an alloy of copper and zinc) was not known to the ancients.</description>

    <description>crown, a member of the church at Corinth, whose family were among those the apostle had baptized (<reflink target="XXX">1 Cor. 1:16; 16:15, 17</reflink>). He has been supposed by some to have been the "jailer of Philippi" (<reflink target="XXX">comp. Acts 16:33</reflink>). The First Epistle to the Corinthians was written from Philippi some six years after the jailer's conversion, and he was with the apostle there at that time.</description>

  <item id="Stephen">
    <description>one of the seven deacons, who became a preacher of the gospel. He was the first Christian martyr. His personal character and history are recorded in Acts 6. "He fell asleep" with a prayer for his persecutors on his lips (7:60). Devout men carried him to his grave (8:2).</description>
    <description>It was at the feet of the young Pharisee, Saul of Tarsus, that those who stoned him laid their clothes (<reflink target="XXX">comp. Deut. 17:5-7</reflink>) before they began their cruel work. The scene which Saul then witnessed and the words he heard appear to have made a deep and lasting impression on his mind (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 22:19, 20</reflink>).</description>
    <description>The speech of Stephen before the Jewish ruler is the first apology for the universalism of the gospel as a message to the Gentiles as well as the Jews. It is the longest speech contained in the Acts, a place of prominence being given to it as a defence.</description>

  <item id="Stoics">
    <description>a sect of Greek philosophers at Athens, so called from the Greek word stoa i.e., a "porch" or "portico," where they have been called "the Pharisees of Greek paganism." The founder of the Stoics was Zeno, who flourished about B.C. 300. He taught his disciples that a man's happiness consisted in bringing himself into harmony with the course of the universe. They were trained to bear evils with indifference, and so to be independent of externals. Materialism, pantheism, fatalism, and pride were the leading features of this philosophy.</description>

  <item id="Stone">
    <description>Stones were commonly used for buildings, also as memorials of important events (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 28:18; Josh. 24:26, 27; 1 Sam. 7:12, etc.</reflink>). They were gathered out of cultivated fields (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 5:2; comp. 2 Kings 3:19</reflink>). This word is also used figuratively of believers (<reflink target="XXX">1 Pet. 2:4, 5</reflink>), and of the Messiah (<reflink target="XXX">Ps. 118:22; Isa. 28:16; Matt. 21:42; Acts 4:11, etc.</reflink>). In Dan. 2:45 it refers also to the Messiah. He is there described as "cut out of the mountain." (<see target="x-self">See ROCK.</see>)</description>
    <description>A "heart of stone" denotes great insensibility (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 25:37</reflink>).</description>
    <description>Stones were set up to commemorate remarkable events, as by Jacob at Bethel (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 28:18</reflink>), at Padan-aram (35:4), and on the occasion of parting with Laban (31:45-47); by Joshua at the place on the banks of the Jordan where the people first "lodged" after crossing the river (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 6:8</reflink>), and also in "the midst of Jordan," where he erected another set of twelve stones (4:1-9); and by Samuel at "Ebenezer" (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 7:12</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Stones, Precious">
    <description>Frequently referred to (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 10:2; 2 Chr. 3:6; 9:10; Rev. 18:16; 21:19</reflink>). There are about twenty different names of such stones in the Bible. They are figuratively introduced to denote value, beauty, durability (<reflink target="XXX">Cant. 5:14; Isa 54:11, 12; Lam. 4:7</reflink>).</description>

  <item id="Stoning">
    <description>a form of punishment (<reflink target="XXX">Lev. 20:2; 24:14; Deut. 13:10; 17:5; 22:21</reflink>) prescribed for certain offences. Of Achan (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 7:25</reflink>), Naboth (1 Kings 21), Stephen (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 7:59</reflink>), Paul (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 14:19; 2 Cor. 11:25</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Stork">
    <description>Heb. hasidah, meaning "kindness," indicating thus the character of the bird, which is noted for its affection for its young. It is in the list of birds forbidden to be eaten by the Levitical law (<reflink target="XXX">Lev. 11:19; Deut. 14:18</reflink>). It is like the crane, but larger in size. Two species are found in Palestine, the white, which are dispersed in pairs over the whole country; and the black, which live in marshy places and in great flocks. They migrate to Palestine periodically (about the 22nd of March). Jeremiah alludes to this (<reflink target="XXX">Jer. 8:7</reflink>). At the appointed time they return with unerring sagacity to their old haunts, and re-occupy their old nests. "There is a well-authenticated account of the devotion of a stork which, at the burning of the town of Delft, after repeated and unsuccessful attempts to carry off her young, chose rather to remain and perish with them than leave them to their fate. Well might the Romans call it the pia avis!"</description>
    <description>In Job 39:13 (A.V.), instead of the expression "or wings and feathers unto the ostrich" (marg., "the feathers of the stork and ostrich"), the Revised Version has "are her pinions and feathers kindly" (marg., instead of "kindly," reads "like the stork's"). The object of this somewhat obscure verse seems to be to point out a contrast between the stork, as distinguished for her affection for her young, and the ostrich, as distinguished for her indifference.</description>
    <description>Zechariah (5:9) alludes to the beauty and power of the stork's wings.</description>

  <item id="Stranger">
    <description>This word generally denotes a person from a foreign land residing in Palestine. Such persons enjoyed many privileges in common with the Jews, but still were separate from them. The relation of the Jews to strangers was regulated by special laws (<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 23:3; 24:14-21; 25:5; 26:10-13</reflink>). A special signification is also sometimes attached to this word. In Gen. 23:4 it denotes one resident in a foreign land; Ex. 23:9, one who is not a Jew; Num. 3:10, one who is not of the family of Aaron; Ps. 69:8, an alien or an unknown person. The Jews were allowed to purchase strangers as slaves (<reflink target="XXX">Lev. 25:44, 45</reflink>), and to take usury from them (<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 23:20</reflink>).</description>

  <item id="Stream of Egypt">
    <description>(<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 27:12</reflink>), the Wady el-'Arish, called also "the river of Egypt," R.V., "brook of Egypt" (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 34:5; Josh. 15:4; 2 Kings 24:7</reflink>). It is the natural boundary of Egypt. Occasionally in winter, when heavy rains have fallen among the mountains inland, it becomes a turbulent rushing torrent. The present boundary between Egypt and Palestine is about midway between el-'Arish and Gaza.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Street">
    <description>The street called "Straight" at Damascus (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 9:11</reflink>) is "a long broad street, running from east to west, about a mile in length, and forming the principal thoroughfare in the city." In Oriental towns streets are usually narrow and irregular and filthy (<reflink target="XXX">Ps. 18:42; Isa. 10:6</reflink>). "It is remarkable," says Porter, "that all the important cities of Palestine and Syria Samaria, Caesarea, Gerasa, Bozrah, Damascus, Palmyra, had their 'straight streets' running through the centre of the city, and lined with stately rows of columns. The most perfect now remaining are those of Palmyra and Gerasa, where long ranges of the columns still stand.", Through Samaria, etc.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Stripes">
    <description>as a punishment were not to exceed forty (<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 25:1-3</reflink>), and hence arose the custom of limiting them to thirty-nine (<reflink target="XXX">2 Cor. 11:24</reflink>). Paul claimed the privilege of a Roman citizen in regard to the infliction of stripes (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 16:37, 38; 22:25-29</reflink>). Our Lord was beaten with stripes (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 27:26</reflink>).</description>

  <item id="Suburbs">
    <description>the immediate vicinity of a city or town (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 35:3, 7; Ezek. 45:2</reflink>). In 2 Kings 23:11 the Hebrew word there used (parvarim) occurs nowhere else. The Revised Version renders it "precincts." The singular form of this Hebrew word (parvar) is supposed by some to be the same as Parbar (q.v.), which occurs twice in 1 Chr. 26:18.</description>

  <item id="Succoth">
    <description>booths. (1.) The first encampment of the Israelites after leaving Ramesses (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 12:37</reflink>); the civil name of Pithom (q.v.).</description>
    <description>(2.) A city on the east of Jordan, identified with Tell Dar'ala, a high mound, a mass of debris, in the plain north of Jabbok and about one mile from it (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 13:27</reflink>). Here Jacob (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 32:17, 30; 33:17</reflink>), on his return from Padan-aram after his interview with Esau, built a house for himself and made booths for his cattle. The princes of this city churlishly refused to afford help to Gideon and his 300 men when "faint yet pursuing" they followed one of the bands of the fugitive Midianites after the great victory at Gilboa. After overtaking and routing this band at Karkor, Gideon on his return visited the rulers of the city with severe punishment. "He took the elders of the city, and thorns of the wilderness and briers, and with them he taught the men of Succoth" (<reflink target="XXX">Judg. 8:13-16</reflink>). At this place were erected the foundries for casting the metal-work for the temple (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 7:46</reflink>).</description>

  <item id="Sun">
    <description>(Heb. shemesh), first mentioned along with the moon as the two great luminaries of heaven (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 1:14-18</reflink>). By their motions and influence they were intended to mark and divide times and seasons. The worship of the sun was one of the oldest forms of false religion (<reflink target="XXX">Job 31:26,27</reflink>), and was common among the Egyptians and Chaldeans and other pagan nations. The Jews were warned against this form of idolatry (<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 4:19; 17:3; comp. 2 Kings 23:11; Jer. 19:13</reflink>).</description>

  <item id="Swallow">
    <description>(1.) Heb. sis (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 38:14; Jer. 8:7</reflink>), the Arabic for the swift, which "is a regular migrant, returning in myriads every spring, and so suddenly that while one day not a swift can be seen in the country, on the next they have overspread the whole land, and fill the air with their shrill cry." The swift (cypselus) is ordinarily classed with the swallow, which it resembles in its flight, habits, and migration.</description>
    <description>(2.) Heb. deror, i.e., "the bird of freedom" (<reflink target="XXX">Ps. 84:3; Prov. 26:2</reflink>), properly rendered swallow, distinguished for its swiftness of flight, its love of freedom, and the impossibility of retaining it in captivity. In Isa. 38:14 and Jer. 8:7 the word thus rendered ('augr) properly means "crane" (as in the R.V.).</description>

  </item>
  <item id="Sycamine tree">
    <description>mentioned only in Luke 17:6. It is rendered by Luther "mulberry tree" (q.v.), which is most probably the correct rendering. It is found of two species, the black mulberry (Morus nigra) and the white mulberry (Mourea), which are common in Palestine. The silk-worm feeds on their leaves. The rearing of them is one of the chief industries of the peasantry of Lebanon and of other parts of the land. It is of the order of the fig-tree. Some contend, however, that this name denotes the sycamore-fig of Luke 19:4.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Sycamore">
    <description>more properly sycomore (Heb. shikmoth and shikmim, Gr. sycomoros), a tree which in its general character resembles the fig-tree, while its leaves resemble those of the mulberry; hence it is called the fig-mulberry (Ficus sycomorus). At Jericho, Zacchaeus climbed a sycomore-tree to see Jesus as he passed by (<reflink target="XXX">Luke 19:4</reflink>). This tree was easily destroyed by frost (<reflink target="XXX">Ps. 78:47</reflink>), and therefore it is found mostly in the "vale" (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 10:27; 2 Chr. 1:15: in both passages the R.V. has properly "lowland"</reflink>), i.e., the "low country," the shephelah, where the climate is mild. Amos (7:14) refers to its fruit, which is of an inferior character; so also probably Jeremiah (24:2). It is to be distinguished from our sycamore (the Acer pseudo-platanus), which is a species of maple often called a plane-tree.</description>

It was the frontier town of Egypt in the south, as Migdol was in the north-east.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Synagogue">
    <description>(Gr. sunagoge, i.e., "an assembly"), found only once in the Authorized Version of Ps. 74:8, where the margin of Revised Version has "places of assembly," which is probably correct; for while the origin of synagogues is unknown, it may well be supposed that buildings or tents for the accommodation of worshippers may have existed in the land from an early time, and thus the system of synagogues would be gradually developed.</description>
    <description>Some, however, are of opinion that it was specially during the Babylonian captivity that the system of synagogue worship, if not actually introduced, was at least reorganized on a systematic plan (<reflink target="XXX">Ezek. 8:1; 14:1</reflink>). The exiles gathered together for the reading of the law and the prophets as they had opportunity, and after their return synagogues were established all over the land (<reflink target="XXX">Ezra 8:15; Neh. 8:2</reflink>). In after years, when the Jews were dispersed abroad, wherever they went they erected synagogues and kept up the stated services of worship (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 9:20; 13:5; 17:1; 17:17; 18:4</reflink>). The form and internal arrangements of the synagogue would greatly depend on the wealth of the Jews who erected it, and on the place where it was built. "Yet there are certain traditional pecularities which have doubtless united together by a common resemblance the Jewish synagogues of all ages and countries. The arrangements for the women's place in a separate gallery or behind a partition of lattice-work; the desk in the centre, where the reader, like Ezra in ancient days, from his 'pulpit of wood,' may 'open the book in the sight of all of people and read in the book of the law of God distinctly, and give the sense, and cause them to understand the reading' (<reflink target="XXX">Neh. 8:4, 8</reflink>); the carefully closed ark on the side of the building nearest to Jerusalem, for the preservation of the rolls or manuscripts of the law; the seats all round the building, whence 'the eyes of all them that are in the synagogue' may 'be fastened' on him who speaks (<reflink target="XXX">Luke 4:20</reflink>); the 'chief seats' (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 23:6</reflink>) which were appropriated to the 'ruler' or 'rulers' of the synagogue, according as its organization may have been more or less complete;", these were features common to all the synagogues.</description>
    <description>Where perfected into a system, the services of the synagogue, which were at the same hours as those of the temple, consisted, (1) of prayer, which formed a kind of liturgy, there were in all eighteen prayers; (2) the reading of the Scriptures in certain definite portions; and (3) the exposition of the portions read. (<reflink target="XXX">See Luke 4:15, 22; Acts 13:14.</reflink>)</description>
    <description>The synagogue was also sometimes used as a court of judicature, in which the rulers presided (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 10:17; Mark 5:22; Luke 12:11; 21:12; Acts 13:15; 22:19</reflink>); also as public schools.</description>
    <description>The establishment of synagogues wherever the Jews were found in sufficient numbers helped greatly to keep alive Israel's hope of the coming of the Messiah, and to prepare the way for the spread of the gospel in other lands. The worship of the Christian Church was afterwards modelled after that of the synagogue.</description>
    <description>Christ and his disciples frequently taught in the synagogues (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 13:54; Mark 6:2; John 18:20; Acts 13:5, 15, 44; 14:1; 17:2-4, 10, 17; 18:4, 26; 19:8</reflink>).</description>

  <item id="Syria">

Mesopotamia is called (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 24:10; Deut. 23:4</reflink>) Aram-naharain (=Syria of the two rivers), also Padan-aram (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 25:20</reflink>). Other portions of Syria were also known by separate names, as Aram-maahah (<reflink target="XXX">1 Chr. 19:6</reflink>), Aram-beth-rehob (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 10:6</reflink>), Aram-zobah (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 10:6, 8</reflink>). All these separate little kingdoms afterwards became subject to Damascus. In the time of the Romans, Syria included also a part of Palestine and Asia Minor.</description>
    <description>"From the historic annals now accessible to us, the history of Syria may be divided into three periods: The first, the period when the power of the Pharaohs was dominant over the fertile fields or plains of Syria and the merchant cities of Tyre and Sidon, and when such mighty conquerors as Thothmes III. and Rameses II. could claim dominion and levy tribute from the nations from the banks of the Euphrates to the borders of the Libyan desert. Second, this was followed by a short period of independence, when the Jewish nation in the south was growing in power, until it reached its early zenith in the golden days of Solomon; and when Tyre and Sidon were rich cities, sending their traders far and wide, over land and sea, as missionaries of civilization, while in the north the confederate tribes of the Hittites held back the armies of the kings of Assyria. The third, and to us most interesting, period is that during which the kings of Assyria were dominant over the plains of Syria; when Tyre, Sidon, Ashdod, and Jerusalem bowed beneath the conquering armies of Shalmaneser, Sargon, and Sennacherib; and when at last Memphis and Thebes yielded to the power of the rulers of Nineveh and Babylon, and the kings of Assyria completed with terrible fulness the bruising of the reed of Egypt so clearly foretold by the Hebrew prophets.", Boscawen.</description>

In the New Testament there are several Syriac words, such as "Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?" (<reflink target="XXX">Mark 15:34; Matt. 27:46 gives the Heb. form, "Eli, Eli"</reflink>), "Raca" (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 5:22</reflink>), "Ephphatha" (<reflink target="XXX">Mark 7:34</reflink>), "Maran-atha" (<reflink target="XXX">1 Cor. 16:22</reflink>).</description>
    <description>A Syriac version of the Old Testament, containing all the canonical books, along with some apocryphal books (called the Peshitto, i.e., simple translation, and not a paraphrase), was made early in the second century, and is therefore the first Christian translation of the Old Testament. It was made directly from the original, and not from the LXX. Version. The New Testament was also translated from Greek into Syriac about the same time. It is noticeable that this version does not contain the Second and Third Epistles of John, 2 Peter, Jude, and the Apocalypse. These were, however, translated subsequently and placed in the version.

    <description>(3.) The human body (<reflink target="XXX">2 Cor. 5:1, 4</reflink>); a tent, as opposed to a permanent dwelling.</description>
    <description>(4.) The sacred tent (Heb. mishkan, "the dwelling-place"); the movable tent-temple which Moses erected for the service of God, according to the "pattern" which God himself showed to him on the mount (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 25:9; Heb. 8:5</reflink>). It is called "the tabernacle of the congregation," rather "of meeting", i.e., where God promised to meet with Israel (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 29:42</reflink>); the "tabernacle of the testimony" (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 38:21; Num. 1:50</reflink>), which does not, however, designate the whole structure, but only the enclosure which contained the "ark of the testimony" (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 25:16, 22; Num. 9:15</reflink>); the "tabernacle of witness" (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 17:8</reflink>); the "house of the Lord" (<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 23:18</reflink>); the "temple of the Lord" (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 6:24</reflink>); a "sanctuary" (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 25:8</reflink>).</description>
    <description>A particular account of the materials which the people provided for the erection and of the building itself is recorded in Ex. 25-40. The execution of the plan mysteriously given to Moses was intrusted to Bezaleel and Aholiab, who were specially endowed with wisdom and artistic skill, probably gained in Egypt, for this purpose (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 35:30-35</reflink>). The people provided materials for the tabernacle so abundantly that Moses was under the necessity of restraining them (36:6). These stores, from which they so liberally contributed for this purpose, must have consisted in a great part of the gifts which the Egyptians so readily bestowed on them on the eve of the Exodus (12:35, 36).</description>
    <description>The tabernacle was a rectangular enclosure, in length about 45 feet (i.e., reckoning a cubit at 18 inches) and in breadth and height about 15. Its two sides and its western end were made of boards of acacia wood, placed on end, resting in sockets of brass, the eastern end being left open (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 26:22</reflink>). This framework was covered with four coverings, the first of linen, in which figures of the symbolic cherubim were wrought with needlework in blue and purple and scarlet threads, and probably also with threads of gold (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 26:1-6; 36:8-13</reflink>). Above this was a second covering of twelve curtains of black goats'-hair cloth, reaching down on the outside almost to the ground (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 26:7-11</reflink>). The third covering was of rams' skins dyed red, and the fourth was of badgers' skins (Heb. tahash, i.e., the dugong, a species of seal), Ex. 25:5; 26:14; 35:7, 23; 36:19; 39:34.</description>
    <description>Internally it was divided by a veil into two chambers, the exterior of which was called the holy place, also "the sanctuary" (<reflink target="XXX">Heb. 9:2</reflink>) and the "first tabernacle" (6); and the interior, the holy of holies, "the holy place," "the Holiest," the "second tabernacle" (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 28:29; Heb. 9:3, 7</reflink>). The veil separating these two chambers was a double curtain of the finest workmanship, which was never passed except by the high priest once a year, on the great Day of Atonement. The holy place was separated from the outer court which enclosed the tabernacle by a curtain, which hung over the six pillars which stood at the east end of the tabernacle, and by which it was entered.</description>
    <description>The order as well as the typical character of the services of the tabernacle are recorded in Heb. 9; 10:19-22.</description>
    <description>The holy of holies, a cube of 10 cubits, contained the "ark of the testimony", i.e., the oblong chest containing the two tables of stone, the pot of manna, and Aaron's rod that budded.</description>
    <description>The holy place was the western and larger chamber of the tabernacle. Here were placed the table for the shewbread, the golden candlestick, and the golden altar of incense.</description>
    <description>Round about the tabernacle was a court, enclosed by curtains hung upon sixty pillars (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 27:9-18</reflink>). This court was 150 feet long and 75 feet broad. Within it were placed the altar of burnt offering, which measured 7 1/2 feet in length and breadth and 4 1/2 feet high, with horns at the four corners, and the laver of brass (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 30:18</reflink>), which stood between the altar and the tabernacle.</description>
    <description>The whole tabernacle was completed in seven months. On the first day of the first month of the second year after the Exodus, it was formally set up, and the cloud of the divine presence descended on it (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 39:22-43; 40:1-38</reflink>). It cost 29 talents 730 shekels of gold, 100 talents 1,775 shekels of silver, 70 talents 2,400 shekels of brass (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 38:24-31</reflink>).</description>
    <description>The tabernacle was so constructed that it could easily be taken down and conveyed from place to place during the wanderings in the wilderness. The first encampment of the Israelites after crossing the Jordan was at Gilgal, and there the tabernacle remained for seven years (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 4:19</reflink>). It was afterwards removed to Shiloh (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 18:1</reflink>), where it remained during the time of the Judges, till the days of Eli, when the ark, having been carried out into the camp when the Israelites were at war with the Philistines, was taken by the enemy (1 Sam. 4), and was never afterwards restored to its place in the tabernacle. The old tabernacle erected by Moses in the wilderness was transferred to Nob (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 21:1</reflink>), and after the destruction of that city by Saul (22:9; 1 Chr. 16:39, 40), to Gibeon. It is mentioned for the last time in 1 Chr. 21:29. A new tabernacle was erected by David at Jerusalem (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 6:17; 1 Chr. 16:1</reflink>), and the ark was brought from Perez-uzzah and deposited in it (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 6:8-17; 2 Chr. 1:4</reflink>).</description>
    <description>The word thus rendered ('ohel) in Ex. 33:7 denotes simply a tent, probably Moses' own tent, for the tabernacle was not yet erected.</description>

  <item id="Tabernacles, Feast of">
    <description>the third of the great annual festivals of the Jews (<reflink target="XXX">Lev. 23:33-43</reflink>). It is also called the "feast of ingathering" (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 23:16; Deut. 16:13</reflink>). It was celebrated immediately after the harvest, in the month Tisri, and the celebration lasted for eight days (<reflink target="XXX">Lev. 23:33-43</reflink>). During that period the people left their homes and lived in booths formed of the branches of trees. The sacrifices offered at this time are mentioned in Num. 29:13-38. It was at the time of this feast that Solomon's temple was dedicated (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 8:2</reflink>). Mention is made of it after the return from the Captivity. This feast was designed (1) to be a memorial of the wilderness wanderings, when the people dwelt in booths (<reflink target="XXX">Lev. 23:43</reflink>), and (2) to be a harvest thanksgiving (<reflink target="XXX">Neh. 8:9-18</reflink>). The Jews, at a later time, introduced two appendages to the original festival, viz., (1) that of drawing water from the Pool of Siloam, and pouring it upon the altar (<reflink target="XXX">John 7:2, 37</reflink>), as a memorial of the water from the rock in Horeb; and (2) of lighting the lamps at night, a memorial of the pillar of fire by night during their wanderings.</description>
    <description>"The feast of Tabernacles, the harvest festival of the Jewish Church, was the most popular and important festival after the Captivity. At Jerusalem it was a gala day. It was to the autumn pilgrims, who arrived on the 14th (of the month Tisri, the feast beginning on the 15th) day, like entrance into a silvan city. Roofs and courtyards, streets and squares, roads and gardens, were green with boughs of citron and myrtle, palm and willow. The booths recalled the pilgrimage through the wilderness. The ingathering of fruits prophesied of the spiritual harvest.", Valling's Jesus Christ, p. 133.</description>

Judg. 4:6-14. There is an old tradition, which, however, is unfounded, that it was the scene of the transfiguration of our Lord. (<see target="x-self">See HERMON.</see>) "The prominence and isolation of Tabor, standing, as it does, on the border-land between the northern and southern tribes, between the mountains and the central plain, made it a place of note in all ages, and evidently led the psalmist to associate it with Hermon, the one emblematic of the south, the other of the north." There are some who still hold that this was the scene of the transfiguration (q.v.).</description>

    <description>(3.) The "plain of Tabor" (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 10:3</reflink>) should be, as in the Revised Version, "the oak of Tabor." This was probably the Allon-bachuth of Gen. 35:8.</description>

  <item id="Tadmor">
    <description>palm, a city built by Solomon "in the wilderness" (<reflink target="XXX">2 Chr. 8:4</reflink>). In 1 Kings 9:18, where the word occurs in the Authorized Version, the Hebrew text and the Revised Version read "Tamar," which is properly a city on the southern border of Palestine and toward the wilderness (<reflink target="XXX">comp. Ezek. 47:19; 48:28</reflink>). In 2 Chr. 8:14 Tadmor is mentioned in connection with Hamath-zobah. It is called Palmyra by the Greeks and Romans. It stood in the great Syrian wilderness, 176 miles from Damascus and 130 from the Mediterranean and was the centre of a vast commercial traffic with Western Asia. It was also an important military station. (<see target="x-self">See SOLOMON.</see>) "Remains of ancient temples and palaces, surrounded by splendid colonnades of white marble, many of which are yet standing, and thousands of prostrate pillars, scattered over a large extent of space, attest the ancient magnificence of this city of palms, surpassing that of the renowned cities of Greece and Rome."</description>

    <description>=Tahpanhes=Tehaphnehes, (called "Daphne" by the Greeks, now Tell Defenneh), an ancient Egyptian city, on the Tanitic branch of the Nile, about 16 miles from Pelusium. The Jews from Jerusalem fled to this place after the death of Gedaliah (q.v.), and settled there for a time (<reflink target="XXX">Jer. 2:16; 43:7; 44:1; 46:14</reflink>). A platform of brick-work, which there is every reason to believe was the pavement at the entry of Pharaoh's palace, has been discovered at this place. "Here," says the discoverer, Mr. Petrie, "the ceremony described by Jeremiah [43:8-10; "brick-kiln", i.e., pavement of brick] took place before the chiefs of the fugitives assembled on the platform, and here Nebuchadnezzar spread his royal pavilion" (R.V., "brickwork").</description>

    <description>(2.) Heb. hegeh, "a thought;" "meditation" (<reflink target="XXX">Ps. 90:9</reflink>); meaning properly "as a whisper of sadness," which is soon over, or "as a thought." The LXX. and Vulgate render it "spider;" the Authorized Version and Revised Version, "as a tale" that is told.

    <description>(2.) The daughter-in-law of Judah, to whose eldest son, Er, she was married (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 38:6</reflink>). After her husband's death, she was married to Onan, his brother (8), and on his death, Judah promised to her that his third son, Shelah, would become her husband.

  <item id="Tammuz">
    <description>a corruption of Dumuzi, the Accadian sun-god (the Adonis of the Greeks), the husband of the goddess Ishtar. In the Chaldean calendar there was a month set apart in honour of this god, the month of June to July, the beginning of the summer solstice. At this festival, which lasted six days, the worshippers, with loud lamentations, bewailed the funeral of the god, they sat "weeping for Tammuz" (<reflink target="XXX">Ezek. 8:14</reflink>).</description>

    <description>(<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 17:6, A.V., after the LXX. and Vulg.</reflink>), a kind of small shield. The margin has "gorget," a piece of armour for the throat. The Revised Version more correctly renders the Hebrew word (kidon) by "javelin." The same Hebrew word is used in Josh. 8:18 (A.V., "spear;" R.V., "javelin"); Job 39:23 (A.V., "shield;" R.V., "javelin"); 41:29 (A.V., "spear;" R.V., "javelin").</description>

  <item id="Tarshish">
    <description>a Sanscrit or Aryan word, meaning "the sea coast." (1.) One of the "sons" of Javan (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 10:4; 1 Chr. 1:7</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(2.) The name of a place which first comes into notice in the days of Solomon. The question as to the locality of Tarshish has given rise to not a little discussion. Some think there was a Tarshish in the East, on the Indian coast, seeing that "ships of Tarshish" sailed from Eziongeber, on the Red Sea (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 9:26; 22:48; 2 Chr. 9:21</reflink>). Some, again, argue that Carthage was the place so named. There can be little doubt, however, that this is the name of a Phoenician port in Spain, between the two mouths of the Guadalquivir (the name given to the river by the Arabs, and meaning "the great wady" or water-course). It was founded by a Carthaginian colony, and was the farthest western harbour of Tyrian sailors. It was to this port Jonah's ship was about to sail from Joppa. It has well been styled "the Peru of Tyrian adventure;" it abounded in gold and silver mines.</description>
    <description>It appears that this name also is used without reference to any locality. "Ships of Tarshish" is an expression sometimes denoting simply ships intended for a long voyage (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 23:1, 14</reflink>), ships of a large size (sea-going ships), whatever might be the port to which they sailed. Solomon's ships were so styled (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 10:22; 22:49</reflink>).</description>

  <item id="Tarsus">
    <description>the chief city of Cilicia. It was distinguished for its wealth and for its schools of learning, in which it rivalled, nay, excelled even Athens and Alexandria, and hence was spoken of as "no mean city." It was the native place of the Apostle Paul (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 21:39</reflink>). It stood on the banks of the river Cydnus, about 12 miles north of the Mediterranean. It is said to have been founded by Sardanapalus, king of Assyria. It is now a filthy, ruinous Turkish town, called Tersous. (<see target="x-self">See PAUL.</see>)</description>

  <item id="Tatnai">
    <description>gift, a Persian governor (Heb. pehah, i.e., "satrap;" modern "pasha") "on this side the river", i.e., of the whole tract on the west of the Euphrates. This Hebrew title _pehah_ is given to governors of provinces generally. It is given to Nehemiah (5:14) and to Zerubbabel (<reflink target="XXX">Hag. 1:1</reflink>). It is sometimes translated "captain" (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 20:24; Dan. 3:2, 3</reflink>), sometimes also "deputy" (<reflink target="XXX">Esther 8:9; 9:3</reflink>).

  <item id="Taverns, The three">
    <description>a place on the great "Appian Way," about 11 miles from Rome, designed for the reception of travellers, as the name indicates. Here Paul, on his way to Rome, was met by a band of Roman Christians (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 28:15</reflink>). The "Tres Tabernae was the first mansio or mutatio, that is, halting-place for relays, from Rome, or the last on the way to the city. At this point three roads run into the Via Appia, that from Tusculum, that from Alba Longa, and that from Antium; so necessarily here would be a halting-place, which took its name from the three shops there, the general store, the blacksmith's, and the refreshment-house...Tres Tabernae is translated as Three Taverns, but it more correctly means three shops" (Forbes's Footsteps of St. Paul, p.20).</description>

    <description>first mentioned in the command (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 30:11-16</reflink>) that every Jew from twenty years and upward should pay an annual tax of "half a shekel for an offering to the Lord." This enactment was faithfully observed for many generations (<reflink target="XXX">2 Chr. 24:6; Matt. 17:24</reflink>).</description>
    <description>Afterwards, when the people had kings to reign over them, they began, as Samuel had warned them (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 8:10-18</reflink>), to pay taxes for civil purposes (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 4:7; 9:15; 12:4</reflink>). Such taxes, in increased amount, were afterwards paid to the foreign princes that ruled over them.</description>
    <description>In the New Testament the payment of taxes, imposed by lawful rulers, is enjoined as a duty (<reflink target="XXX">Rom. 13:1-7; 1 Pet. 2:13, 14</reflink>). Mention is made of the tax (telos) on merchandise and travellers (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 17:25</reflink>); the annual tax (phoros) on property (<reflink target="XXX">Luke 20:22; 23:2</reflink>); the poll-tax (kensos, "tribute," Matt. 17:25; 22:17; Mark 12:14); and the temple-tax ("tribute money" = two drachmas = half shekel, Matt. 17:24-27; comp.

    <description>(<reflink target="XXX">Luke 2:2; R.V., "enrolment"</reflink>), "when Cyrenius was governor of Syria," is simply a census of the people, or an enrolment of them with a view to their taxation. The decree for the enrolment was the occasion of Joseph and Mary's going up to Bethlehem. It has been argued by some that Cyrenius (q.v.) was governor of Cilicia and Syria both at the time of our Lord's birth and some years afterwards. This decree for the taxing referred to the whole Roman world, and not to Judea alone. (See CENSUS</description>

  <item id="Teil tree">
    <description>(an old name for the lime-tree, the tilia), Isa. 6:13, the terebinth, or turpentine-tree, the Pistacia terebinthus of botanists. The Hebrew word here used (elah) is rendered oak (q.v.) in Gen. 35:4; Judg. 6:11, 19; Isa. 1:29, etc. In Isa. 61:3 it is rendered in the plural "trees;" Hos. 4:13, "elm" (R.V., "terebinth"). Hos. 4:13, "elm" (R.V., "terebinth"). In 1 Sam. 17:2, 19 it is taken as a proper name, "Elah" (R.V. marg., "terebinth").</description>

Her address to the king was in the form of an apologue, similar to that of Nathan (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 12:1-6</reflink>). The object of Joab was, by the intervention of this woman, to induce David to bring back Absalom to Jerusalem (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 14:2, 4, 9</reflink>).</description>

  <item id="Temple, Herod's">
    <description>The temple erected by the exiles on their return from Babylon had stood for about five hundred years, when Herod the Great became king of Judea. The building had suffered considerably from natural decay as well as from the assaults of hostile armies, and Herod, desirous of gaining the favour of the Jews, proposed to rebuild it. This offer was accepted, and the work was begun (B.C. 18), and carried out at great labour and expense, and on a scale of surpassing splendour. The main part of the building was completed in ten years, but the erection of the outer courts and the embellishment of the whole were carried on during the entire period of our Lord's life on earth (<reflink target="XXX">John 2:16, 19-21</reflink>), and the temple was completed only A.D. 65. But it was not long permitted to exist. Within forty years after our Lord's crucifixion, his prediction of its overthrow was accomplished (<reflink target="XXX">Luke 19: 41-44</reflink>). The Roman legions took the city of Jerusalem by storm, and notwithstanding the strenuous efforts Titus made to preserve the temple, his soldiers set fire to it in several places, and it was utterly destroyed (A.D. 70), and was never rebuilt.</description>
    <description>Several remains of Herod's stately temple have by recent explorations been brought to light. It had two courts, one intended for the Israelites only, and the other, a large outer court, called "the court of the Gentiles," intended for the use of strangers of all nations. These two courts were separated by a low wall, as Josephus states, some 4 1/2 feet high, with thirteen openings. Along the top of this dividing wall, at regular intervals, were placed pillars bearing in Greek an inscription to the effect that no stranger was, on the pain of death, to pass from the court of the Gentiles into that of the Jews. At the entrance to a graveyard at the north-western angle of the Haram wall, a stone was discovered by M. Ganneau in 1871, built into the wall, bearing the following inscription in Greek capitals: "No stranger is to enter within the partition wall and enclosure around the sanctuary. Whoever is caught will be responsible to himself for his death, which will ensue."</description>
    <description>There can be no doubt that the stone thus discovered was one of those originally placed on the boundary wall which separated the Jews from the Gentiles, of which Josephus speaks.</description>
    <description>It is of importance to notice that the word rendered "sanctuary" in the inscription was used in a specific sense of the inner court, the court of the Israelites, and is the word rendered "temple" in John 2:15 and Acts 21:28, 29. When Paul speaks of the middle wall of partition (<reflink target="XXX">Eph. 2:14</reflink>), he probably makes allusion to this dividing wall. Within this partition wall stood the temple proper, consisting of, (1) the court of the women, 8 feet higher than the outer court; (2) 10 feet higher than this court was the court of Israel; (3) the court of the priests, again 3 feet higher; and lastly (4) the temple floor, 8 feet above that; thus in all 29 feet above the level of the outer court.</description>
    <description>The summit of Mount Moriah, on which the temple stood, is now occupied by the Haram esh-Sherif, i.e., "the sacred enclosure." This enclosure is about 1,500 feet from north to south, with a breadth of about 1,000 feet, covering in all a space of about 35 acres. About the centre of the enclosure is a raised platform, 16 feet above the surrounding space, and paved with large stone slabs, on which stands the Mohammedan mosque called Kubbet es-Sahkra i.e., the "Dome of the Rock," or the Mosque of Omar. This mosque covers the site of Solomon's temple. In the centre of the dome there is a bare, projecting rock, the highest part of Moriah (q.v.), measuring 60 feet by 40, standing 6 feet above the floor of the mosque, called the sahkra, i.e., "rock." Over this rock the altar of burnt-offerings stood. It was the threshing-floor of Araunah the Jebusite. The exact position on this "sacred enclosure" which the temple occupied has not been yet definitely ascertained. Some affirm that Herod's temple covered the site of Solomon's temple and palace, and in addition enclosed a square of 300 feet at the south-western angle. The temple courts thus are supposed to have occupied the southern portion of the "enclosure," forming in all a square of more than 900 feet. It is argued by others that Herod's temple occupied a square of 600 feet at the south-west of the "enclosure."</description>

  <item id="Temple, Solomon's">
    <description>Before his death David had "with all his might" provided materials in great abundance for the building of the temple on the summit of Mount Moriah (<reflink target="XXX">1 Chr. 22:14; 29:4; 2 Chr. 3:1</reflink>), on the east of the city, on the spot where Abraham had offered up Isaac (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 22:1-14</reflink>). In the beginning of his reign Solomon set about giving effect to the desire that had been so earnestly cherished by his father, and prepared additional materials for the building. From subterranean quarries at Jerusalem he obtained huge blocks of stone for the foundations and walls of the temple. These stones were prepared for their places in the building under the eye of Tyrian master-builders. He also entered into a compact with Hiram II., king of Tyre, for the supply of whatever else was needed for the work, particularly timber from the forests of Lebanon, which was brought in great rafts by the sea to Joppa, whence it was dragged to Jerusalem (1 Kings 5). As the hill on which the temple was to be built did not afford sufficient level space, a huge wall of solid masonry of great height, in some places more than 200 feet high, was raised across the south of the hill, and a similar wall on the eastern side, and in the spaces between were erected many arches and pillars, thus raising up the general surface to the required level. Solomon also provided for a sufficient water supply for the temple by hewing in the rocky hill vast cisterns, into which water was conveyed by channels from the "pools" near Bethlehem. One of these cisterns, the "great sea," was capable of containing three millions of gallons. The overflow was led off by a conduit to the Kidron.</description>
    <description>In all these preparatory undertakings a space of about three years was occupied; and now the process of the erection of the great building began, under the direction of skilled Phoenician builders and workmen, in the fourth year of Solomon's reign, 480 years after the Exodus (1 Kings 6; 2 Chr. 3). Many thousands of labourers and skilled artisans were employed in the work. Stones prepared in the quarries underneath the city (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 5:17, 18</reflink>) of huge dimension (<see target="x-self">see QUARRIES</see>) were gradually placed on the massive walls, and closely fitted together without any mortar between, till the whole structure was completed. No sound of hammer or axe or any tool of iron was heard as the structure arose (6:7). "Like some tall palm the noiseless fabric sprang." The building was 60 cubits long, 20 cubits wide, and 30 cubits high. The engineers of the Palestine Exploration Fund, in their explorations around the temple area, discovered what is believed to have been the "chief corner stone" of the temple, "the most interesting stone in the world." It lies at the bottom of the south-eastern angle, and is 3 feet 8 inches high by 14 feet long. It rests on the solid rock at a depth of 79 feet 3 inches below the present surface. (<see target="x-self">See PINNACLE.</see>) In examining the walls the engineers were "struck with admiration at the vastness of the blocks and the general excellence of the workmanship."</description>
    <description>At length, in the autumn of the eleventh year of his reign, seven and a half years after it had been begun, the temple was completed in all its architectural magnificence and beauty. For thirteen years there it stood, on the summit of Moriah, silent and unused. The reasons for this strange delay in its consecration are unknown. At the close of these thirteen years preparations for the dedication of the temple were made on a scale of the greatest magnificence. The ark was solemnly brought from the tent in which David had deposited it to the place prepared for it in the temple, and the glory-cloud, the symbol of the divine presence, filled the house. Then Solomon ascended a platform which had been erected for him, in the sight of all the people, and lifting up his hands to heaven poured out his heart to God in prayer (1 Kings 8; 2 Chr. 6, 7). The feast of dedication, which lasted seven days, followed by the feast of tabernacles, marked a new era in the history of Israel. On the eighth day of the feast of tabernacles, Solomon dismissed the vast assemblage of the people, who returned to their homes filled with joy and gladness, "Had Solomon done no other service beyond the building of the temple, he would still have influenced the religious life of his people down to the latest days. It was to them a perpetual reminder and visible symbol of God's presence and protection, a strong bulwark of all the sacred traditions of the law, a witness to duty, an impulse to historic study, an inspiration of sacred song."</description>
    <description>The temple consisted of, (1.) The oracle or most holy place (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 6:19; 8:6</reflink>), called also the "inner house" (6:27), and the "holiest of all" (<reflink target="XXX">Heb. 9:3</reflink>). It was 20 cubits in length, breadth, and height. It was floored and wainscotted with cedar (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 6:16</reflink>), and its walls and floor were overlaid with gold (6:20, 21, 30). There was a two-leaved door between it and the holy place overlaid with gold (<reflink target="XXX">2 Chr. 4:22</reflink>); also a veil of blue purple and crimson and fine linen (<reflink target="XXX">2 Chr. 3:14; comp. Ex. 26:33</reflink>). It had no windows (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 8:12</reflink>). It was indeed the dwelling-place of God. (2.) The holy place (q.v.), 1 Kings 8:8-10, called also the "greater house" (<reflink target="XXX">2 Chr. 3:5</reflink>) and the "temple" (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 6:17</reflink>). (3.) The porch or entrance before the temple on the east (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 6:3; 2 Chr. 3:4; 29:7</reflink>). In the porch stood the two pillars Jachin and Boaz (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 7:21; 2 Kings 11:14; 23:3</reflink>). (4.) The chambers, which were built about the temple on the southern, western, and northern sides (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 6:5-10</reflink>). These formed a part of the building.</description>
    <description>Round about the building were, (1.) The court of the priests (<reflink target="XXX">2 Chr. 4:9</reflink>), called the "inner court" (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 6:36</reflink>). It contained the altar of burnt-offering (<reflink target="XXX">2 Chr. 15:8</reflink>), the brazen sea (4:2-5, 10), and ten lavers (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 7:38, 39</reflink>). (2.) The great court, which surrounded the whole temple (<reflink target="XXX">2 Chr. 4:9</reflink>). Here the people assembled to worship God (<reflink target="XXX">Jer. 19:14; 26:2</reflink>).</description>
    <description>This temple erected by Solomon was many times pillaged during the course of its history, (1) 1 Kings 14:25, 26; (2) 2 Kings 14:14; (3) 2 Kings 16:8, 17, 18; (4) 2 Kings 18:15, 16. At last it was pillaged and destroyed by Nebuchadnezzar (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 24:13; 2 Chr. 36:7</reflink>). He burned the temple, and carried all its treasures with him to Babylon (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 25:9-17; 2 Chr. 36:19; Isa. 64:11</reflink>). These sacred vessels were at length, at the close of the Captivity, restored to the Jews by Cyrus (<reflink target="XXX">Ezra 1:7-11</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Temple, the Second">
    <description>After the return from captivity, under Zerubbabel (q.v.) and the high priest Jeshua, arrangements were almost immediately made to reorganize the long-desolated kingdom. The body of pilgrims, forming a band of 42,360, including children, having completed the long and dreary journey of some four months, from the banks of the Euphrates to Jerusalem, were animated in all their proceeding by a strong religious impulse, and therefore one of their first cares was to restore their ancient worship by rebuilding the temple. On the invitation of Zerubbabel, the governor, who showed them a remarkable example of liberality by contributing personally 1,000 golden darics (probably about $6,000), besides other gifts, the people with great enthusiasm poured their gifts into the sacred treasury (Ezra 2). First they erected and dedicated the altar of Jehovah on the exact spot where it had formerly stood, and they then cleared away the charred heaps of debris which occupied the site of the old temple; and in the second month of the second year (B.C. 535), amid great public excitement and rejoicing (Ps. 116; 117; 118), the foundations of the second temple were laid. A wide interest was felt in this great movement, although it was regarded with mingled feelings by the spectators (<reflink target="XXX">Hag. 2:3; Zech. 4:10</reflink>). The Samaritans made proposals for a co-operation in the work. Zerubbabel and Jeshua and the elders, however, declined all such cooperation: Judah must build the temple without help. Immediately evil reports were spread regarding the Jews. The Samaritans sought to "frustrate their purpose" (<reflink target="XXX">Ezra 4:5</reflink>), and sent messengers to Ecbatana and Susa, with the result that the work was suspended. Seven years after this Cyrus died ingloriously, having killed himself in Syria when on his way back from Egypt to the east, and was succeeded by his son Cambyses (B.C. 529-522), on whose death the "false Smerdis," an imposter, occupied the throne for some seven or eight months, and then Darius Hystaspes became king (B.C. 522). In the second year of this monarch the work of rebuilding the temple was resumed and carried forward to its completion (<reflink target="XXX">Ezra 5: 6-17; 6:1-15</reflink>), under the stimulus of the earnest counsels and admonitions of the prophets Haggai and Zechariah. It was ready for consecration in the spring of B.C. 516, twenty years after the return from captivity.</description>
    <description>This second temple had not the ark, the Urim and Thummim, the holy oil, the sacred fire, the tables of stone, the pot of manna, and Aaron's rod. As in the tabernacle, there was in it only one golden lamp for the holy place, one table of shewbread, and the incense altar, with golden censers, and many of the vessels of gold that had belonged to Solomon's temple that had been carried to Babylon but restored by Cyrus (<reflink target="XXX">Ezra 1:7-11</reflink>).</description>
    <description>This second temple also differed from the first in that, while in the latter there were numerous "trees planted in the courts of the Lord," there were none in the former. The second temple also had for the first time a space, being a part of the outer court, provided for proselytes who were worshippers of Jehovah, although not subject to the laws of Judaism.</description>
    <description>The temple, when completed, was consecrated amid great rejoicings on the part of all the people (<reflink target="XXX">Ezra 6:16</reflink>), although there were not wanting outward evidences that the Jews were no longer an independent people, but were subject to a foreign power.</description>
    <description>Hag. 2:9 is rightly rendered in the Revised Version, "The latter glory of this house shall be greater than the former," instead of, "The glory of this latter house," etc., in the Authorized Version. The temple, during the different periods of its existence, is regarded as but one house, the one only house of God (<reflink target="XXX">comp. 2:3</reflink>). The glory here predicted is spiritual glory and not material splendour. "Christ himself, present bodily in the temple on Mount Zion during his life on earth, present spiritually in the Church now, present in the holy city, the heavenly Jerusalem, of which he is the temple, calling forth spiritual worship and devotion is the glory here predicted" (Perowne).</description>

  <item id="Temptation">
    <description>(1.) Trial; a being put to the test. Thus God "tempted [Gen. 22: 1; R.V., 'did prove'] Abraham;" and afflictions are said to tempt, i.e., to try, men (<reflink target="XXX">James 1:2, 12; comp. Deut. 8:2</reflink>), putting their faith and patience to the test. (2.) Ordinarily, however, the word means solicitation to that which is evil, and hence Satan is called "the tempter" (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 4:3</reflink>). Our Lord was in this way tempted in the wilderness. That temptation was not internal, but by a real, active, subtle being. It was not self-sought. It was submitted to as an act of obedience on his part. "Christ was led, driven. An unseen personal force bore him a certain violence is implied in the words" (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 4:1-11</reflink>).</description>
    <description>The scene of the temptation of our Lord is generally supposed to have been the mountain of Quarantania (q.v.), "a high and precipitous wall of rock, 1,200 or 1,500 feet above the plain west of Jordan, near Jericho."</description>
    <description>Temptation is common to all (<reflink target="XXX">Dan. 12:10; Zech. 13:9; Ps. 66:10; Luke 22:31, 40; Heb. 11:17; James 1:12; 1 Pet. 1:7; 4:12</reflink>). We read of the temptation of Joseph (Gen. 39), of David (2 Sam. 24; 1 Chr. 21), of Hezekiah (<reflink target="XXX">2 Chr. 32:31</reflink>), of Daniel (Dan. 6), etc. So long as we are in this world we are exposed to temptations, and need ever to be on our watch against them.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Tent">
    <description>(1.) Heb. 'ohel (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 9:21, 27</reflink>). This word is used also of a dwelling or habitation (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 8:66; Isa. 16:5; Jer. 4:20</reflink>), and of the temple (<reflink target="XXX">Ezek. 41:1</reflink>). When used of the tabernacle, as in 1 Kings 1:39, it denotes the covering of goat's hair which was placed over the mishcan.</description>
    <description>(2.) Heb. mishcan (<reflink target="XXX">Cant. 1:8</reflink>), used also of a dwelling (<reflink target="XXX">Job 18:21; Ps. 87:2</reflink>), the grave (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 22:16; comp. 14:18</reflink>), the temple (<reflink target="XXX">Ps. 46:4; 84:2; 132:5</reflink>), and of the tabernacle (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 25:9; 26:1; 40:9; Num. 1:50, 53; 10:11</reflink>). When distinguished from 'ohel, it denotes the twelve interior curtains which lay upon the framework of the tabernacle (q.v.).</description>
    <description>(3.) Heb. kubbah (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 25:8</reflink>), a dome-like tent devoted to the impure worship of Baal-peor.</description>
    <description>(4.) Heb. succah (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 11:11</reflink>), a tent or booth made of green boughs or branches (<reflink target="XXX">see Gen. 33:17; Lev. 23:34, 42; Ps. 18:11; Jonah 4:5; Isa. 4:6; Neh. 8:15-17, where the word is variously rendered</reflink>).</description>
    <description>Jubal was "the father of such as dwell in tents" (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 4:20</reflink>). The patriarchs were "dwellers in tents" (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 9:21, 27; 12:8; 13:12; 26:17</reflink>); and during their wilderness wanderings all Israel dwelt in tents (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 16:16; Deut. 33:18; Josh. 7:24</reflink>). Tents have always occupied a prominent place in Eastern life (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 17:54; 2 Kings 7:7; Ps. 120:5; Cant. 1:5</reflink>). Paul the apostle's occupation was that of a tent-maker (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 18:3</reflink>); i.e., perhaps a maker of tent cloth.</description>

    <description>the wanderer; loiterer, for some unknown reason emigrated with his family from his native mountains in the north to the plains of Mesopotamia. He had three sons, Haran, Nahor, and Abraham, and one daughter, Sarah. He settled in "Ur of the Chaldees," where his son Haran died, leaving behind him his son Lot. Nahor settled at Haran, a place on the way to Ur. Terah afterwards migrated with Abraham (probably his youngest son) and Lot (his grandson), together with their families, from Ur, intending to go with them to Canaan; but he tarried at Haran, where he spent the remainder of his days, and died at the age of two hundred and five years (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 11:24-32; Josh. 24:2</reflink>). What a wonderful part the descendants of this Chaldean shepherd have played in the history of the world!</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Teraphim">
    <description>givers of prosperity, idols in human shape, large or small, analogous to the images of ancestors which were revered by the Romans. In order to deceive the guards sent by Saul to seize David, Michal his wife prepared one of the household teraphim, putting on it the goat's-hair cap worn by sleepers and invalids, and laid it in a bed, covering it with a mantle. She pointed it out to the soldiers, and alleged that David was confined to his bed by a sudden illness (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 19:13-16</reflink>). Thus she gained time for David's escape. It seems strange to read of teraphim, images of ancestors, preserved for superstitious purposes, being in the house of David. Probably they had been stealthily brought by Michal from her father's house. "Perhaps," says Bishop Wordsworth, "Saul, forsaken by God and possessed by the evil spirit, had resorted to teraphim (as he afterwards resorted to witchcraft); and God overruled evil for good, and made his very teraphim (by the hand of his own daughter) to be an instrument for David's escape.", Deane's David, p. 32. Josiah attempted to suppress this form of idolatry (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 23:24</reflink>). The ephod and teraphim are mentioned together in Hos. 3:4. It has been supposed by some (Cheyne's Hosea) that the "ephod" here mentioned, and also in Judg. 8:24-27, was not the part of the sacerdotal dress so called (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 28:6-14</reflink>), but an image of Jehovah overlaid with gold or silver (comp. Judg. 17, 18; 1 Sam. 21:9; 23:6, 9; 30:7, 8), and is thus associated with the teraphim. (<see target="x-self">See THUMMIM.</see>)</description>

From the fact that Luke applies to him the title "most excellent", the same title Paul uses in addressing Felix (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 23:26; 24:3</reflink>) and Festus (26:25), it has been concluded that Theophilus was a person of rank, perhaps a Roman officer.</description>

  <item id="Thessalonians, Epistles to the">
    <description>The first epistle to the Thessalonians was the first of all Paul's epistles. It was in all probability written from Corinth, where he abode a "long time" (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 18:11, 18</reflink>), early in the period of his residence there, about the end of A.D. 52.</description>
    <description>The occasion of its being written was the return of Timotheus from Macedonia, bearing tidings from Thessalonica regarding the state of the church there (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 18:1-5; 1 Thess. 3:6</reflink>). While, on the whole, the report of Timothy was encouraging, it also showed that divers errors and misunderstandings regarding the tenor of Paul's teaching had crept in amongst them. He addresses them in this letter with the view of correcting these errors, and especially for the purpose of exhorting them to purity of life, reminding them that their sanctification was the great end desired by God regarding them.</description>
    <description>The subscription erroneously states that this epistle was written from Athens.</description>
    <description>The second epistle to the Thessalonians was probably also written from Corinth, and not many months after the first.</description>
    <description>The occasion of the writing of this epistle was the arrival of tidings that the tenor of the first epistle had been misunderstood, especially with reference to the second advent of Christ. The Thessalonians had embraced the idea that Paul had taught that "the day of Christ was at hand", that Christ's coming was just about to happen. This error is corrected (2:1-12), and the apostle prophetically announces what first must take place. "The apostasy" was first to arise. Various explanations of this expression have been given, but that which is most satisfactory refers it to the Church of Rome.</description>

  <item id="Thessalonica">
    <description>a large and populous city on the Thermaic bay. It was the capital of one of the four Roman districts of Macedonia, and was ruled by a praetor. It was named after Thessalonica, the wife of Cassander, who built the city. She was so called by her father, Philip, because he first heard of her birth on the day of his gaining a victory over the Thessalians. On his second missionary journey, Paul preached in the synagogue here, the chief synagogue of the Jews in that part of Macedonia, and laid the foundations of a church (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 17:1-4; 1 Thes. 1:9</reflink>). The violence of the Jews drove him from the city, when he fled to Berea (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 17:5-10</reflink>). The "rulers of the city" before whom the Jews "drew Jason," with whom Paul and Silas lodged, are in the original called politarchai, an unusual word, which was found, however, inscribed on an arch in Thessalonica. This discovery confirms the accuracy of the historian. Paul visited the church here on a subsequent occasion (20:1-3). This city long retained its importance. It is the most important town of European Turkey, under the name of Saloniki, with a mixed population of about 85,000.</description>

  <item id="Thieves, The two">
    <description>(<reflink target="XXX">Luke 23:32, 39-43</reflink>), robbers, rather brigands, probably followers of Barabbas. Our Lord's cross was placed between those of the "malefactors," to add to the ignominy of his position. According to tradition, Demas or Dismas was the name of the penitent thief hanging on the right, and Gestas of the impenitent on the left.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Thistle">
    <description>(1.) Heb. hoah (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 14:9; Job 31:40</reflink>). In Job 41:2 the Hebrew word is rendered "thorn," but in the Revised Version "hook." It is also rendered "thorn" in 2 Chr. 33:11; Prov. 26:9; Cant. 2:2; "brambles" in Isa. 34:13. It is supposed to be a variety of the wild plum-tree, but by some it is regarded as the common thistle, of which there are many varieties in Palestine.</description>
    <description>(2.) Heb. dardar, meaning "a plant growing luxuriantly" (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 3:18; Hos. 10:8</reflink>); Gr. tribolos, "a triple point" (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 7:16; Heb. 6:8, "brier," R.V. "thistle"</reflink>). This was probably the star-thistle, called by botanists Centaurea calcitropa, or "caltrops," a weed common in corn-fields. (See THORNS</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Thomas">
    <description>twin, one of the twelve (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 10:3; Mark 3:18, etc.</reflink>). He was also called Didymus (<reflink target="XXX">John 11:16; 20:24</reflink>), which is the Greek equivalent of the Hebrew name. All we know regarding him is recorded in the fourth Gospel (<reflink target="XXX">John 11:15, 16; 14:4, 5; 20:24, 25, 26-29</reflink>). From the circumstance that in the lists of the apostles he is always mentioned along with Matthew, who was the son of Alphaeus (<reflink target="XXX">Mark 3:18</reflink>), and that these two are always followed by James, who was also the son of Alphaeus, it has been supposed that these three, Matthew, Thomas, and James, were brothers.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Thorn">
    <description>(1.) Heb. hedek (<reflink target="XXX">Prov. 15:19</reflink>), rendered "brier" in Micah 7:4. Some thorny plant, of the Solanum family, suitable for hedges. This is probably the so-called "apple of Sodom," which grows very abundantly in the Jordan valley. "It is a shrubby plant, from 3 to 5 feet high, with very branching stems, thickly clad with spines, like those of the English brier, with leaves very large and woolly on the under side, and thorny on the midriff."</description>
    <description>(2.) Heb. kotz (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 3:18; Hos. 10:8</reflink>), rendered _akantha_ by the LXX. In the New Testament this word _akantha_ is also rendered "thorns" (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 7:16; 13:7; Heb. 6:8</reflink>). The word seems to denote any thorny or prickly plant (<reflink target="XXX">Jer. 12:13</reflink>). It has been identified with the Ononis spinosa by some.</description>
    <description>(3.) Heb. na'atzutz (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 7:19; 55:13</reflink>). This word has been interpreted as denoting the Zizyphus spina Christi, or the jujube-tree. It is supposed by some that the crown of thorns placed in wanton cruelty by the Roman soldiers on our Saviour's brow before his crucifixion was plaited of branches of this tree. It overruns a great part of the Jordan valley. It is sometimes called the lotus-tree. "The thorns are long and sharp and recurved, and often create a festering wound." It often grows to a great size. (<see target="x-self">See CROWN OF THORNS.</see>)</description>
    <description>(4.) Heb. atad (<reflink target="XXX">Ps. 58:9</reflink>) is rendered in the LXX. and Vulgate by Rhamnus, or Lycium Europoeum, a thorny shrub, which is common all over Palestine. From its resemblance to the box it is frequently called the box-thorn.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Thorn in the flesh">
    <description>(<reflink target="XXX">2 Cor. 12:7-10</reflink>). Many interpretations have been given of this passage. (1.) Roman Catholic writers think that it denotes suggestions to impiety.</description>
    <description>(2.) Luther, Calvin, and other Reformers interpret the expression as denoting temptation to unbelief.</description>
    <description>(3.) Others suppose the expression refers to "a pain in the ear or head," epileptic fits, or, in general, to some severe physical infirmity, which was a hindrance to the apostle in his work (comp. 1 Cor. 2:3; 2 Cor. 10:10; 11:30; Gal. 4:13, 14; 6:17). With a great amount of probability, it has been alleged that his malady was defect of sight, consequent on the dazzling light which shone around him at his conversion, acute opthalmia. This would account for the statements in Gal. 4:14; 2 Cor. 10:10; also Acts 23:5, and for his generally making use of the help of an amanuensis (<reflink target="XXX">comp. Rom. 16:22, etc.</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(4.) Another view which has been maintained is that this "thorn" consisted in an infirmity of temper, to which he occasionally gave way, and which interfered with his success (<reflink target="XXX">comp. Acts 15:39; 23:2-5</reflink>). If we consider the fact, "which the experience of God's saints in all ages has conclusively established, of the difficulty of subduing an infirmity of temper, as well as the pain, remorse, and humiliation such an infirmity is wont to cause to those who groan under it, we may be inclined to believe that not the least probable hypothesis concerning the 'thorn' or 'stake' in the flesh is that the loving heart of the apostle bewailed as his sorest trial the misfortune that, by impatience in word, he had often wounded those for whom he would willingly have given his life" (Lias's Second Cor., Introd.).</description>

  <item id="Thousands">
    <description>(<reflink target="XXX">Micah 5:2</reflink>), another name for "families" or "clans" (<reflink target="XXX">see Num. 1:16; 10:4; Josh. 22:14, 21</reflink>). Several "thousands" or "families" made up a "tribe."</description>

  <item id="Threshold">
    <description>(1.) Heb. miphtan, probably a projecting beam at a higher point than the threshold proper (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 5:4,5; Ezek. 9:3; 10:4,18; 46:2; 47:1</reflink>); also rendered "door" and "door-post."</description>
    <description>(2.) 'Asuppim, pl. (<reflink target="XXX">Neh. 12:25</reflink>), rendered correctly "storehouses" in the Revised Version. In 1 Chr. 26:15, 17 the Authorized Version retains the word as a proper name, while in the Revised Version it is translated "storehouses."</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Throne">
    <description>(Heb. kiss'e), a royal chair or seat of dignity (<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 17:18; 2 Sam. 7:13; Ps. 45:6</reflink>); an elevated seat with a canopy and hangings, which cover it. It denotes the seat of the high priest in 1 Sam. 1:9; 4:13, and of a provincial governor in Neh. 3:7 and Ps. 122:5. The throne of Solomon is described at length in 1 Kings 10:18-20.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Thummim">
    <description>perfection (LXX., "truth;" Vulg., "veritas"), Ex. 28:30; Deut. 33:8; Judg. 1:1; 20:18; 1 Sam. 14:3,18; 23:9; 2 Sam. 21:1. What the "Urim and Thummim" were cannot be determined with any certainty. All we certainly know is that they were a certain divinely-given means by which God imparted, through the high priest, direction and counsel to Israel when these were needed. The method by which this was done can be only a matter of mere conjecture. They were apparently material objects, quite distinct from the breastplate, but something added to it after all the stones had been set in it, something in addition to the breastplate and its jewels. They may have been, as some suppose, two small images, like the teraphim (<reflink target="XXX">comp. Judg. 17:5; 18:14, 17, 20; Hos. 3:4</reflink>), which were kept in the bag of the breastplate, by which, in some unknown way, the high priest could give forth his divinely imparted decision when consulted. They were probably lost at the destruction of the temple by Nebuchadnezzar. They were never seen after the return from captivity.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Thunder">
    <description>often referred to in Scripture (<reflink target="XXX">Job 40:9; Ps. 77:18; 104:7</reflink>). James and John were called by our Lord "sons of thunder" (<reflink target="XXX">Mark 3:17</reflink>). In Job 39:19, instead of "thunder," as in the Authorized Version, the Revised Version translates (ra'amah) by "quivering main" (marg., "shaking"). Thunder accompanied the giving of the law at Sinai (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 19:16</reflink>). It was regarded as the voice of God (<reflink target="XXX">Job 37:2; Ps. 18:13; 81:7; comp. John 12:29</reflink>). In answer to Samuel's prayer (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 12:17, 18</reflink>), God sent thunder, and "all the people greatly feared," for at such a season (the wheat-harvest) thunder and rain were almost unknown in Palestine.</description>

  <item id="Thyatira">
    <description>a city of Asia Minor, on the borders of Lydia and Mysia. Its modern name is Ak-hissar, i.e., "white castle." Here was one of the seven churches (<reflink target="XXX">Rev. 1:11; 2:18-28</reflink>). Lydia, the seller of purple, or rather of cloth dyed with this colour, was from this city (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 16:14</reflink>). It was and still is famous for its dyeing. Among the ruins, inscriptions have been found relating to the guild of dyers in that city in ancient times.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Thyine wood">
    <description>mentioned only in Rev. 18:12 among the articles which would cease to be purchased when Babylon fell. It was called citrus, citron wood, by the Romans. It was the Callitris quadrivalvis of botanists, of the cone-bearing order of trees, and of the cypress tribe of this order. The name of this wood is derived from the Greek word _thuein_, "to sacrifice," and it was so called because it was burnt in sacrifices, on account of its fragrance. The wood of this tree was reckoned very valuable, and was used for making articles of furniture by the Greeks and Romans. Like the cedars of Lebanon, it is disappearing from the forests of Palestine.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Tiberias">
    <description>a city, the modern Tubarich, on the western shore of the Sea of Tiberias. It is said to have been founded by Herod Antipas (A.D. 16), on the site of the ruins of an older city called Rakkath, and to have been thus named by him after the Emperor Tiberius. It is mentioned only three times in the history of our Lord (<reflink target="XXX">John 6:1,23; 21:1</reflink>).</description>
    <description>In 1837 about one-half of the inhabitants perished by an earthquake. The population of the city is now about six thousand, nearly the one-half being Jews. "We do not read that our Lord ever entered this city. The reason of this is probably to be found in the fact that it was practically a heathen city, though standing upon Jewish soil. Herod, its founder, had brought together the arts of Greece, the idolatry of Rome, and the gross lewdness of Asia. There were in it a theatre for the performance of comedies, a forum, a stadium, a palace roofed with gold in imitation of those in Italy, statues of the Roman gods, and busts of the deified emperors. He who was not sent but to the lost sheep of the house of Israel might well hold himself aloof from such scenes as these" (Manning's Those Holy Fields).</description>
    <description>After the fall of Jerusalem (A.D. 70), Tiberias became one of the chief residences of the Jews in Palestine. It was for more than three hundred years their metropolis. From about A.D. 150 the Sanhedrin settled here, and established rabbinical schools, which rose to great celebrity. Here the Jerusalem (or Palestinian) Talmud was compiled about the beginning of the fifth century. To this same rabbinical school also we are indebted for the Masora, a "body of traditions which transmitted the readings of the Hebrew text of the Old Testament, and preserved, by means of the vowel-system, the pronunciation of the Hebrew." In its original form, and in all manuscripts, the Hebrew is written without vowels; hence, when it ceased to be a spoken language, the importance of knowing what vowels to insert between the consonants. This is supplied by the Masora, and hence these vowels are called the "Masoretic vowel-points."</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Tiberias, Sea of">
    <description>called also the Sea of Galilee (q.v.) and of Gennesaret. In the Old Testament it is called the Sea of Chinnereth or Chinneroth. John (21:1) is the only evangelist who so designates this lake. His doing so incidentally confirms the opinion that he wrote after the other evangelists, and at a period subsequent to the taking of Jerusalem (A.D. 70). Tiberias had by this time become an important city, having been spared by the Romans, and made the capital of the province when Jerusalem was destroyed. It thus naturally gave its name to the lake.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Tiberius Caesar">
    <description>i.e., as known in Roman history, Tiberius Claudius Nero, only mentioned in Luke 3:1. He was the stepson of Augustus, whom he succeeded on the throne, A.D. 14. He was noted for his vicious and infamous life. In the fifteenth year of his reign John the Baptist entered on his public ministry, and under him also our Lord taught and suffered. He died A.D. 37. He is frequently referred to simply as "Caesar" (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 22:17, 21; Mark 12:14, 16, 17; Luke 20:22, 24, 25; 23:2; John 19:12, 15</reflink>).</description>

  <item id="Tiglath-Pileser I">
    <description>(not mentioned in Scripture) was the most famous of the monarchs of the first Assyrian empire (about B.C. 1110). After his death, for two hundred years the empire fell into decay. The history of David and Solomon falls within this period. He was succeeded by his son, Shalmaneser II.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Tiglath-Pileser III">
    <description>or Tilgath-Pil-neser, the Assyrian throne-name of Pul (q.v.). He appears in the Assyrian records as gaining, in the fifth year of his reign (about B.C. 741), a victory over Azariah (= Uzziah in 2 Chr.26:1), king of Judah, whose achievements are described in 2 Chr. 26:6-15. He is first mentioned in Scripture, however, as gaining a victory over Pekah, king of Israel, and Rezin of Damascus, who were confederates. He put Rezin to death, and punished Pekah by taking a considerable portion of his kingdom, and carrying off (B.C. 734) a vast number of its inhabitants into captivity (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 15:29; 16:5-9; 1 Chr. 5:6, 26</reflink>), the Reubenites, the Gadites, and half the tribe of Manasseh whom he settled in Gozan. In the Assyrian annals it is further related that, before he returned from Syria, he held a court at Damascus, and received submission and tribute from the neighbouring kings, among whom were Pekah of Samaria and "Yahu-khazi [i.e., Ahaz], king of Judah" (comp. 2 Kings 16:10-16).</description>
    <description>He was the founder of what is called "the second Assyrian empire," an empire meant to embrace the whole world, the centre of which should be Nineveh. He died B.C. 728, and was succeeded by a general of his army, Ulula, who assumed the name Shalmaneser IV.</description>

    <description>remaining portion, the city of Joshua in the hill country of Ephraim, the same as Timnath-heres (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 19:50; 24:30</reflink>). "Of all sites I have seen," says Lieut. Col. Conder, "none is so striking as that of Joshua's home, surrounded as it is with deep valleys and wild, rugged hills." Opposite the town is a hill, on the northern side of which there are many excavated sepulchres. Among these is the supposed tomb of Joshua, which is said to be "the most striking monument in the country." It is a "square chamber with five excavations in three of its sides, the central one forming a passage leading into a second chamber beyond. A great number of lamp-niches cover the walls of the porch, upwards of two hundred, arranged in vertical rows. A single cavity with a niche for a lamp has been thought to be the resting-place of the warrior-chief of Israel." The modern Kefr Haris, 10 miles south-west of Shechem.</description>

  <item id="Timothy">
    <description>honouring God, a young disciple who was Paul's companion in many of his journeyings. His mother, Eunice, and his grandmother, Lois, are mentioned as eminent for their piety (<reflink target="XXX">2 Tim. 1:5</reflink>). We know nothing of his father but that he was a Greek (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 16:1</reflink>). He is first brought into notice at the time of Paul's second visit to Lystra (16:2), where he probably resided, and where it seems he was converted during Paul's first visit to that place (<reflink target="XXX">1 Tim. 1:2; 2 Tim. 3:11</reflink>). The apostle having formed a high opinion of his "own son in the faith," arranged that he should become his companion (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 16:3</reflink>), and took and circumcised him, so that he might conciliate the Jews. He was designated to the office of an evangelist (<reflink target="XXX">1 Tim. 4:14</reflink>), and went with Paul in his journey through Phrygia, Galatia, and Mysia; also to Troas and Philippi and Berea (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 17:14</reflink>). Thence he followed Paul to Athens, and was sent by him with Silas on a mission to Thessalonica (17:15; 1 Thess. 3:2). We next find him at Corinth (<reflink target="XXX">1 Thess. 1:1; 2 Thess. 1:1</reflink>) with Paul. He passes now out of sight for a few years, and is again noticed as with the apostle at Ephesus (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 19:22</reflink>), whence he is sent on a mission into Macedonia. He accompanied Paul afterwards into Asia (20:4), where he was with him for some time. When the apostle was a prisoner at Rome, Timothy joined him (<reflink target="XXX">Phil. 1:1</reflink>), where it appears he also suffered imprisonment (<reflink target="XXX">Heb. 13:23</reflink>). During the apostle's second imprisonment he wrote to Timothy, asking him to rejoin him as soon as possible, and to bring with him certain things which he had left at Troas, his cloak and parchments (<reflink target="XXX">2 Tim. 4:13</reflink>). According to tradition, after the apostle's death he settled in Ephesus as his sphere of labour, and there found a martyr's grave.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Timothy, First Epistle to">
    <description>Paul in this epistle speaks of himself as having left Ephesus for Macedonia (1:3), and hence not Laodicea, as mentioned in the subscription; but probably Philippi, or some other city in that region, was the place where this epistle was written. During the interval between his first and second imprisonments he probably visited the scenes of his former labours in Greece and Asia, and then found his way into Macedonia, whence he wrote this letter to Timothy, whom he had left behind in Ephesus.</description>
    <description>It was probably written about A.D. 66 or 67.</description>
    <description>The epistle consists mainly, (1) of counsels to Timothy regarding the worship and organization of the Church, and the responsibilities resting on its several members; and (2) of exhortation to faithfulness in maintaining the truth amid surrounding errors.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Timothy, Second Epistle to">
    <description>was probably written a year or so after the first, and from Rome, where Paul was for a second time a prisoner, and was sent to Timothy by the hands of Tychicus. In it he entreats Timothy to come to him before winter, and to bring Mark with him (<reflink target="XXX">comp. Phil. 2:22</reflink>). He was anticipating that "the time of his departure was at hand" (<reflink target="XXX">2 Tim. 4:6</reflink>), and he exhorts his "son Timothy" to all diligence and steadfastness, and to patience under persecution (1:6-15), and to a faithful discharge of all the duties of his office (4:1-5), with all the solemnity of one who was about to appear before the Judge of quick and dead.</description>

    <description>Heb. bedil (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 31:22; Ezek. 22:18, 20</reflink>), a metal well known in ancient times. It is the general opinion that the Phoenicians of Tyre and Sidon obtained their supplies of tin from the British Isles. In Ezek. 27:12 it is said to have been brought from Tarshish, which was probably a commercial emporium supplied with commodities from other places. In Isa. 1:25 the word so rendered is generally understood of lead, the alloy with which the silver had become mixed (ver. 22). The fire of the Babylonish Captivity would be the means of purging out the idolatrous alloy that had corrupted the people.</description>

  <item id="Tiphsah">
    <description>passing over; ford, one of the boundaries of Solomon's dominions (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 4:24</reflink>), probably "Thapsacus, a great and wealthy town on the western bank of the Euphrates," about 100 miles north-east of Tadmor. All the land traffic between the east and the west passed through it. Menahem undertook an expedition against this city, and "smote Tiphsah and all that were therein" (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 15:16</reflink>). This expedition implied a march of some 300 miles from Tirzah if by way of Tadmor, and about 400 if by way of Aleppo; and its success showed the strength of the Israelite kingdom, for it was practically a defiance to Assyria. Conder, however, identifies this place with Khurbet Tafsah, some 6 miles west of Shechem.</description>

  </item>
  <item id="Tires">
    <description>"To tire" the head is to adorn it (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 9:30</reflink>). As a noun the word is derived from "tiara," and is the rendering of the Heb. p'er, a "turban" or an ornament for the head (<reflink target="XXX">Ezek. 24:17; R.V., "headtire;" 24:23</reflink>). In Isa. 3:18 the word _saharonim_ is rendered "round tires like the moon," and in Judg. 8:21, 26 "ornaments," but in both cases "crescents" in the Revised Version.</description>

  <item id="Tirhakah">
    <description>the last king of Egypt of the Ethiopian (the fifteenth) dynasty. He was the brother-in-law of So (q.v.). He probably ascended the throne about B.C. 692, having been previously king of Ethiopia (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 19:9; Isa. 37:9</reflink>), which with Egypt now formed one nation. He was a great warrior, and but little is known of him. The Assyrian armies under Esarhaddon, and again under Assur-bani-pal, invaded Egypt and defeated Tirhakah, who afterwards retired into Ethiopia, where he died, after reigning twenty-six years.</description>

  <item id="Tirshatha">
    <description>a word probably of Persian origin, meaning "severity," denoting a high civil dignity. The Persian governor of Judea is so called (<reflink target="XXX">Ezra 2:63; Neh. 7:65, 70</reflink>). Nehemiah is called by this name in Neh. 8:9; 10:1, and the "governor" (pehah) in 5:18. Probably, therefore, tirshatha=pehah=the modern pasha.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Tirza">
    <description>pleasantness. (1.) An old royal city of the Canaanites, which was destroyed by Joshua (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 12:24</reflink>). Jeroboam chose it for his residence, and he removed to it from Shechem, which at first he made the capital of his kingdom. It remained the chief residence of the kings of Israel till Omri took Samaria (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 14:17; 15:21; 16:6, 8, etc.</reflink>). Here Zimri perished amid the flames of the palace to which in his despair he had set fire (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 16:18</reflink>), and here Menahem smote Shallum (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 15:14, 16</reflink>). Solomon refers to its beauty (<reflink target="XXX">Cant. 6:4</reflink>). It has been identified with the modern mud hamlet Teiasir, 11 miles north of Shechem. Others, however, would identify it with Telluza, a village about 6 miles east of Samaria.</description>

  <item id="Tishbite">
    <description>Elijah the prophet was thus named (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 17:1; 21:17, 28, etc.</reflink>). In 1 Kings 17:1 the word rendered "inhabitants" is in the original the same as that rendered "Tishbite," hence that verse may be read as in the LXX., "Elijah the Tishbite of Tishbi in Gilead." Some interpret this word as meaning "stranger," and read the verse, "Elijah the stranger from among the strangers in Gilead." This designation is probably given to the prophet as denoting that his birthplace was Tishbi, a place in Upper Galilee (mentioned in the apocryphal book of Tobit), from which for some reason he migrated into Gilead. Josephus, the Jewish historian (<reflink target="XXX">Ant. 8:13, 2</reflink>), however, supposes that Tishbi was some place in the land of Gilead. It has been identified by some with el-Ishtib, a some place 22 miles due south of the Sea of Galilee, among the mountains of Gilead.</description>

  <item id="Tisri">
    <description>the first month of the civil year, and the seventh of the ecclesiastical year. See ETHANIM (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 8:2</reflink>). Called in the Assyrian inscriptions Tasaritu, i.e. "beginning."</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Tithe">
    <description>a tenth of the produce of the earth consecrated and set apart for special purposes. The dedication of a tenth to God was recognized as a duty before the time of Moses. Abraham paid tithes to Melchizedek (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 14:20; Heb. 7:6</reflink>); and Jacob vowed unto the Lord and said, "Of all that thou shalt give me I will surely give the tenth unto thee."</description>
    <description>The first Mosaic law on this subject is recorded in Lev. 27:30-32. Subsequent legislation regulated the destination of the tithes (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 18:21-24, 26-28; Deut. 12:5, 6, 11, 17; 14:22, 23</reflink>). The paying of the tithes was an important part of the Jewish religious worship. In the days of Hezekiah one of the first results of the reformation of religion was the eagerness with which the people brought in their tithes (<reflink target="XXX">2 Chr. 31:5, 6</reflink>). The neglect of this duty was sternly rebuked by the prophets (<reflink target="XXX">Amos 4:4; Mal. 3:8-10</reflink>). It cannot be affirmed that the Old Testament law of tithes is binding on the Christian Church, nevertheless the principle of this law remains, and is incorporated in the gospel (<reflink target="XXX">1 Cor. 9:13, 14</reflink>); and if, as is the case, the motive that ought to prompt to liberality in the cause of religion and of the service of God be greater now than in Old Testament times, then Christians outght to go beyond the ancient Hebrew in consecrating both themselves and their substance to God.</description>
    <description>Every Jew was required by the Levitical law to pay three tithes of his property (1) one tithe for the Levites; (2) one for the use of the temple and the great feasts; and (3) one for the poor of the land.</description>

  <item id="Titus">
    <description>honourable, was with Paul and Barnabas at Antioch, and accompanied them to the council at Jerusalem (<reflink target="XXX">Gal. 2:1-3; Acts 15:2</reflink>), although his name nowhere occurs in the Acts of the Apostles. He appears to have been a Gentile, and to have been chiefly engaged in ministering to Gentiles; for Paul sternly refused to have him circumcised, inasmuch as in his case the cause of gospel liberty was at stake. We find him, at a later period, with Paul and Timothy at Ephesus, whence he was sent by Paul to Corinth for the purpose of getting the contributions of the church there in behalf of the poor saints at Jerusalem sent forward (<reflink target="XXX">2 Cor. 8:6; 12:18</reflink>). He rejoined the apostle when he was in Macedonia, and cheered him with the tidings he brought from Corinth (7:6-15). After this his name is not mentioned till after Paul's first imprisonment, when we find him engaged in the organization of the church in Crete, where the apostle had left him for this purpose (<reflink target="XXX">Titus 1:5</reflink>). The last notice of him is in 2 Tim. 4:10, where we find him with Paul at Rome during his second imprisonment. From Rome he was sent into Dalmatia, no doubt on some important missionary errand. We have no record of his death. He is not mentioned in the Acts.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Titus, Epistle to">
    <description>was probably written about the same time as the first epistle to Timothy, with which it has many affinities. "Both letters were addressed to persons left by the writer to preside in their respective churches during his absence. Both letters are principally occupied in describing the qualifications to be sought for in those whom they should appoint to offices in the church; and the ingredients of this description are in both letters nearly the same. Timothy and Titus are likewise cautioned against the same prevailing corruptions, and in particular against the same misdirection of their cares and studies. This affinity obtains not only in the subject of the letters, which from the similarity of situation in the persons to whom they were addressed might be expected to be somewhat alike, but extends in a great variety of instances to the phrases and expressions. The writer accosts his two friends with the same salutation, and passes on to the business of his letter by the same transition (comp. 1 Tim. 1:2, 3 with Titus 1:4, 5; 1 Tim.1:4 with Titus 1:13, 14; 3:9; 1 Tim. 4:12 with Titus 2:7, 15).", Paley's Horae Paulinae.</description>
    <description>The date of its composition may be concluded from the circumstance that it was written after Paul's visit to Crete (<reflink target="XXX">Titus 1:5</reflink>). That visit could not be the one referred to in Acts 27:7, when Paul was on his voyage to Rome as a prisoner, and where he continued a prisoner for two years. We may warrantably suppose that after his release Paul sailed from Rome into Asia and took Crete by the way, and that there he left Titus "to set in order the things that were wanting." Thence he went to Ephesus, where he left Timothy, and from Ephesus to Macedonia, where he wrote First Timothy, and thence to Nicopolis in Epirus, from which place he wrote to Titus, about A.D. 66 or 67.</description>
    <description>In the subscription to the epistle it is said to have been written from "Nicopolis of Macedonia," but no such place is known. The subscriptions to the epistles are of no authority, as they are not authentic.</description>

"Eliashib the priest" prepared for him during Nehemiah's absence "a chamber in the courts of the house of God," which on his return grieved Nehemiah sore, and therefore he "cast forth all the household stuff of Tobiah out of the chamber" (13:7, 8).</description>

  <item id="Tombs">
    <description>of the Hebrews were generally excavated in the solid rock, or were natural caves. Mention is made of such tombs in Judg. 8:32; 2 Sam. 2:32; 2 Kings 9:28; 23:30. They were sometimes made in gardens (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 21:26; 23:16; Matt. 27:60</reflink>). They are found in great numbers in and around Jerusalem and all over the land. They were sometimes whitewashed (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 23:27, 29</reflink>). The body of Jesus was laid in Joseph's new rock-hewn tomb, in a garden near to Calvary. All evidence is in favour of the opinion that this tomb was somewhere near the Damascus gate, and outside the city, and cannot be identified with the so-called "holy sepulchre." The mouth of such rocky tombs was usually closed by a large stone (Heb. golal), which could only be removed by the united efforts of several men (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 28:2; comp.

    <description>granted on the day of Pentecost (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 2:4</reflink>), in fulfilment of a promise Christ had made to his disciples (<reflink target="XXX">Mark 16:17</reflink>). What this gift actually was has been a subject of much discussion. Some have argued that it was merely an outward sign of the presence of the Holy Spirit among the disciples, typifying his manifold gifts, and showing that salvation was to be extended to all nations. But the words of Luke (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 2:9</reflink>) clearly show that the various peoples in Jerusalem at the time of Pentecost did really hear themselves addressed in their own special language with which they were naturally acquainted (<reflink target="XXX">comp. Joel 2:28, 29</reflink>).</description>
    <description>Among the gifts of the Spirit the apostle enumerates in 1 Cor. 12:10-14:30, "divers kinds of tongues" and the "interpretation of tongues." This "gift" was a different manifestation of the Spirit from that on Pentecost, although it resembled it in many particulars. Tongues were to be "a sign to them that believe not."</description>

  <item id="Tophet">
    <description>=Topheth, from Heb. toph "a drum," because the cries of children here sacrificed by the priests of Moloch were drowned by the noise of such an instrument; or from taph or toph, meaning "to burn," and hence a place of burning, the name of a particular part in the valley of Hinnom. "Fire being the most destructive of all elements, is chosen by the sacred writers to symbolize the agency by which God punishes or destroys the wicked. We are not to assume from prophetical figures that material fire is the precise agent to be used. It was not the agency employed in the destruction of Sennacherib, mentioned in Isa. 30:33...Tophet properly begins where the Vale of Hinnom bends round to the east, having the cliffs of Zion on the north, and the Hill of Evil Counsel on the south. It terminates at Beer 'Ayub, where it joins the Valley of Jehoshaphat. The cliffs on the southern side especially abound in ancient tombs. Here the dead carcasses of beasts and every offal and abomination were cast, and left to be either devoured by that worm that never died or consumed by that fire that was never quenched." Thus Tophet came to represent the place of punishment. (<see target="x-self">See HINNOM.</see>)</description>

Although it was the time of full moon, yet in the valley of the Kidron "there fell great, deep shadows from the declivity of the mountain and projecting rocks; there were there caverns and grottos, into which a fugitive might retreat; finally, there were probably a garden-house and tower, into whose gloom it might be necessary for a searcher to throw light around."

The fullest account is given by Luke, who, no doubt, was informed by Peter, who was present on the occasion. What these evangelists record was an absolute historical reality, and not a mere vision. The concurrence between them in all the circumstances of the incident is exact. John seems to allude to it also (<reflink target="XXX">John 1:14</reflink>). Forty years after the event Peter distinctly makes mention of it (<reflink target="XXX">2 Pet. 1:16-18</reflink>). In describing the sanctification of believers, Paul also seems to allude to this majestic and glorious appearance of our Lord on the "holy mount" (<reflink target="XXX">Rom. 12:2; 2 Cor. 3:18</reflink>).</description>

Probably the lesson conveyed was that life was to be sought by man, not in himself or in his own power, but from without, from Him who is emphatically the Life (<reflink target="XXX">John 1:4; 14:6</reflink>). Wisdom is compared to the tree of life (<reflink target="XXX">Prov. 3:18</reflink>).

    <description>(Heb. 'asham, "debt"), the law concerning, given in Lev. 5:14-6:7; also in Num. 5:5-8. The idea of sin as a "debt" pervades this legislation. The _asham_, which was always a ram, was offered in cases where sins were more private. (See OFFERING</description>

  <item id="Tribe">
    <description>a collection of families descending from one ancestor. The "twelve tribes" of the Hebrews were the twelve collections of families which sprang from the sons of Jacob. In Matt. 24:30 the word has a wider significance. The tribes of Israel are referred to as types of the spiritual family of God (Rev. 7).

  <item id="Tribulation">
    <description>trouble or affiction of any kind (<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 4:30; Matt. 13:21; 2 Cor. 7:4</reflink>). In Rom. 2:9 "tribulation and anguish" are the penal sufferings that shall overtake the wicked. In Matt. 24:21, 29, the word denotes the calamities that were to attend the destruction of Jerusalem.</description>

  <item id="Tribute">
    <description>a tax imposed by a king on his subjects (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 20:24; 1 Kings 4:6; Rom. 13:6</reflink>). In Matt. 17:24-27 the word denotes the temple rate (the "didrachma," the "half-shekel," as rendered by the R.V.) which was required to be paid for the support of the temple by every Jew above twenty years of age (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 30:12; 2 Kings 12:4; 2 Chr. 24:6, 9</reflink>). It was not a civil but a religious tax.</description>
    <description>In Matt. 22:17, Mark 12:14, Luke 20:22, the word may be interpreted as denoting the capitation tax which the Romans imposed on the Jewish people. It may, however, be legitimately regarded as denoting any tax whatever imposed by a foreign power on the people of Israel. The "tribute money" shown to our Lord (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 22:19</reflink>) was the denarius, bearing Caesar's superscription. It was the tax paid by every Jew to the Romans.

  <item id="Trinity">
    <description>a word not found in Scripture, but used to express the doctrine of the unity of God as subsisting in three distinct Persons. This word is derived from the Gr. trias, first used by Theophilus (A.D. 168-183), or from the Lat. trinitas, first used by Tertullian (A.D. 220), to express this doctrine. The propositions involved in the doctrine are these: 1. That God is one, and that there is but one God (<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 6:4; 1 Kings 8:60; Isa. 44:6; Mark 12:29, 32; John 10:30</reflink>). 2. That the Father is a distinct divine Person (hypostasis, subsistentia, persona, suppositum intellectuale), distinct from the Son and the Holy Spirit. 3. That Jesus Christ was truly God, and yet was a Person distinct from the Father and the Holy Spirit. 4. That the Holy Spirit is also a distinct divine Person.</description>

  <item id="Troas">
    <description>a city on the coast of Mysia, in the north-west of Asia Minor, named after ancient Troy, which was at some little distance from it (about 4 miles) to the north. Here Paul, on his second missionary journey, saw the vision of a "man of Macedonia," who appeared to him, saying, "Come over, and help us" (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 16:8-11</reflink>). He visited this place also on other occasions, and on one of these visits he left his cloak and some books there (<reflink target="XXX">2 Cor. 2:12; 2 Tim. 4:13</reflink>). The ruins of Troas extend over many miles, the site being now mostly covered with a forest of oak trees. The modern name of the ruins is Eski Stamboul i.e., Old Constantinople.</description>

Some were made of silver (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 10:2</reflink>), and were used only by the priests in announcing the approach of festivals and in giving signals of war. Some were also made of rams' horns (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 6:8</reflink>).

    <description>(2.) A nation, probably descended from the son of Japheth. It is mentioned by Isaiah (66:19), along with Javan, and by Ezekiel (27:13), along with Meshech, among the traders with Tyre, also among the confederates of Gog (<reflink target="XXX">Ezek. 38:2, 3; 39:1</reflink>), and with Meshech among the nations which were to be destroyed (32:26).

  <item id="Turtle, Turtle-dove">
    <description>Its peculiar peaceful and gentle habit its often referred to in Scripture. A pair was offered in sacrifice by Mary at her purification (<reflink target="XXX">Luke 2:24</reflink>). The pigeon and the turtle-dove were the only birds permitted to be offered in sacrifice (<reflink target="XXX">Lev. 1:14; 5:7; 14:22; 15:14, 29, etc.</reflink>). The Latin name of this bird, _turtur_, is derived from its note, and is a repetition of the Hebrew name _tor_. Three species are found in Palestine, (1) the turtle-dove (Turtur auritus), (2) the collared turtle (T. risorius), and (3) the palm turtle (T. Senegalensis). But it is to the first of these species which the various passages of Scripture refer. It is a migratory bird (<reflink target="XXX">Jer. 8:7; Cant. 2:11, 12</reflink>). "Search the glades and valleys, even by sultry Jordan, at the end of March, and not a turtle-dove is to be seen. Return in the second week of April, and clouds of doves are feeding on the clovers of the plain. They overspread the whole face of the land." "Immediately on its arrival it pours forth from every garden, grove, and wooded hill its melancholy yet soothing ditty unceasingly from early dawn till sunset. It is from its plaintive and continuous note, doubtless, that David, pouring forth his heart's sorrow to God, compares himself to a turtle-dove" (<reflink target="XXX">Ps. 74:19</reflink>).</description>

  <item id="Type">
    <description>occurs only once in Scripture (<reflink target="XXX">1 Cor. 10:11, A.V. marg.</reflink>). The Greek word _tupos_ is rendered "print" (<reflink target="XXX">John 20:25</reflink>), "figure" (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 7:43; Rom. 5:14</reflink>), "fashion" (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 7:44</reflink>), "manner" (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 23:25</reflink>), "form" (<reflink target="XXX">Rom. 6:17</reflink>), "example" or "ensample" (<reflink target="XXX">1 Cor. 10:6, 11; Phil. 3:17; 1 Thess. 1:7; 2 Thess. 3:9; 1 Tim. 4:12</reflink>). It properly means a "model" or "pattern" or "mould" into which clay or wax was pressed, that it might take the figure or exact shape of the mould. The word "type" is generally used to denote a resemblance between something present and something future, which is called the "antitype."</description>

  <item id="Tyrannus">
    <description>prince, a Greek rhetorician, in whose "school" at Ephesus Paul disputed daily for the space of two years with those who came to him (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 19:9</reflink>). Some have supposed that he was a Jew, and that his "school" was a private synagogue.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Tyre">
    <description>a rock, now es-Sur; an ancient Phoenician city, about 23 miles, in a direct line, north of Acre, and 20 south of Sidon. Sidon was the oldest Phoenician city, but Tyre had a longer and more illustrious history. The commerce of the whole world was gathered into the warehouses of Tyre. "Tyrian merchants were the first who ventured to navigate the Mediterranean waters; and they founded their colonies on the coasts and neighbouring islands of the AEgean Sea, in Greece, on the northern coast of Africa, at Carthage and other places, in Sicily and Corsica, in Spain at Tartessus, and even beyond the pillars of Hercules at Gadeira (Cadiz)" (Driver's Isaiah). In the time of David a friendly alliance was entered into between the Hebrews and the Tyrians, who were long ruled over by their native kings (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 5:11; 1 Kings 5:1; 2 Chr. 2:3</reflink>).</description>
    <description>Tyre consisted of two distinct parts, a rocky fortress on the mainland, called "Old Tyre," and the city, built on a small, rocky island about half-a-mile distant from the shore. It was a place of great strength. It was besieged by Shalmaneser, who was assisted by the Phoenicians of the mainland, for five years, and by Nebuchadnezzar (B.C. 586-573) for thirteen years, apparently without success. It afterwards fell under the power of Alexander the Great, after a siege of seven months, but continued to maintain much of its commercial importance till the Christian era. It is referred to in Matt. 11:21 and Acts 12:20. In A.D. 1291 it was taken by the Saracens, and has remained a desolate ruin ever since.</description>
    <description>"The purple dye of Tyre had a worldwide celebrity on account of the durability of its beautiful tints, and its manufacture proved a source of abundant wealth to the inhabitants of that city."</description>
    <description>Both Tyre and Sidon "were crowded with glass-shops, dyeing and weaving establishments; and among their cunning workmen not the least important class were those who were celebrated for the engraving of precious stones." (<reflink target="XXX">2 Chr. 2:7,14</reflink>).</description>
    <description>The wickedness and idolatry of this city are frequently denounced by the prophets, and its final destruction predicted (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 23:1; Jer. 25:22; Ezek. 26; 28:1-19; Amos 1:9, 10; Zech. 9:2-4</reflink>).</description>
    <description>Here a church was founded soon after the death of Stephen, and Paul, on his return from his third missionary journey spent a week in intercourse with the disciples there (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 21:4</reflink>). Here the scene at Miletus was repeated on his leaving them. They all, with their wives and children, accompanied him to the sea-shore. The sea-voyage of the apostle terminated at Ptolemais, about 38 miles from Tyre. Thence he proceeded to Caesarea (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 21:5-8</reflink>).</description>
    <description>"It is noticed on monuments as early as B.C. 1500, and claiming, according to Herodotus, to have been founded about B.C. 2700. It had two ports still existing, and was of commercial importance in all ages, with colonies at Carthage (about B.C. 850) and all over the Mediterranean. It was often attacked by Egypt and Assyria, and taken by Alexander the Great after a terrible siege in B.C. 332. It is now a town of 3,000 inhabitants, with ancient tombs and a ruined cathedral. A short Phoenician text of the fourth century B.C. is the only monument yet recovered."</description>

  <item id="Tyropoeon Valley">
    <description>(i.e., "Valley of the Cheesemongers"), the name given by Josephus the historian to the valley or rugged ravine which in ancient times separated Mount Moriah from Mount Zion. This valley, now filled up with a vast accumulation of rubbish, and almost a plain, was spanned by bridges, the most noted of which was Zion Bridge, which was probably the ordinary means of communication between the royal palace on Zion and the temple. A fragment of the arch (q.v.) of this bridge (called "Robinson's Arch"), where it projects from the sanctuary wall, was discovered by Robinson in 1839. This arch was destroyed by the Romans when Jerusalem was taken.</description>
    <description>The western wall of the temple area rose up from the bottom of this valley to the height of 84 feet, where it was on a level with the area, and above this, and as a continuance of it, the wall of Solomon's cloister rose to the height of about 50 feet, "so that this section of the wall would originally present to view a stupendous mass of masonry scarcely to be surpassed by any mural masonry in the world."</description>

    <description>the Eulaus of the Greeks; a river of Susiana. It was probably the eastern branch of the Choasper (Kerkhan), which divided into two branches some 20 miles above the city of Susa.

It was in reality a two-horned animal; but the exact reference of the word so rendered (reem) is doubtful. Some have supposed it to be the buffalo; others, the white antelope, called by the Arabs rim. Most probably, however, the word denotes the Bos primigenius ("primitive ox"), which is now extinct all over the world. This was the auerochs of the Germans, and the urus described by Caesar (Gal. Bel., vi.28) as inhabiting the Hercynian forest. The word thus rendered has been found in an Assyrian inscription written over the wild ox or bison, which some also suppose to be the animal intended (<reflink target="XXX">comp.

  </item>
  <item id="Ur">
    <description>light, or the moon city, a city "of the Chaldees," the birthplace of Haran (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 11:28,31</reflink>), the largest city of Shinar or northern Chaldea, and the principal commercial centre of the country as well as the centre of political power. It stood near the mouth of the Euphrates, on its western bank, and is represented by the mounds (of bricks cemented by bitumen) of el-Mugheir, i.e., "the bitumined," or "the town of bitumen," now 150 miles from the sea and some 6 miles from the Euphrates, a little above the point where it receives the Shat el-Hie, an affluent from the Tigris. It was formerly a maritime city, as the waters of the Persian Gulf reached thus far inland. Ur was the port of Babylonia, whence trade was carried on with the dwellers on the gulf, and with the distant countries of India, Ethiopia, and Egypt. It was abandoned about B.C. 500, but long continued, like Erech, to be a great sacred cemetery city, as is evident from the number of tombs found there. (See ABRAHAM</description>
    <description>The oldest king of Ur known to us is Ur-Ba'u (servant of the goddess Ba'u), as Hommel reads the name, or Ur-Gur, as others read it. He lived some twenty-eight hundred years B.C., and took part in building the famous temple of the moon-god Sin in Ur itself. The illustration here given represents his cuneiform inscription, written in the Sumerian language, and stamped upon every brick of the temple in Ur. It reads: "Ur-Ba'u, king of Ur, who built the temple of the moon-god."</description>
    <description>"Ur was consecrated to the worship of Sin, the Babylonian moon-god. It shared this honour, however, with another city, and this city was Haran, or Harran. Harran was in Mesopotamia, and took its name from the highroad which led through it from the east to the west. The name is Babylonian, and bears witness to its having been founded by a Babylonian king. The same witness is still more decisively borne by the worship paid in it to the Babylonian moon-god and by its ancient temple of Sin. Indeed, the temple of the moon-god at Harran was perhaps even more famous in the Assyrian and Babylonian world than the temple of the moon-god at Ur.</description>
    <description>"Between Ur and Harran there must, consequently, have been a close connection in early times, the record of which has not yet been recovered. It may be that Harran owed its foundation to a king of Ur; at any rate the two cities were bound together by the worship of the same deity, the closest and most enduring bond of union that existed in the ancient world. That Terah should have migrated from Ur to Harran, therefore, ceases to be extraordinary. If he left Ur at all, it was the most natural place to which to go. It was like passing from one court of a temple into another.</description>
    <description>"Such a remarkable coincidence between the Biblical narrative and the evidence of archaeological research cannot be the result of chance. The narrative must be historical; no writer of late date, even if he were a Babylonian, could have invented a story so exactly in accordance with what we now know to have been the truth. For a story of the kind to have been the invention of Palestinian tradition is equally impossible. To the unprejudiced mind there is no escape from the conclusion that the history of the migration of Terah from Ur to Harran is founded on fact" (Sayce).</description>

    <description>a contracted form of Azari'ah the Lord is my strength. (1.) One of Amaziah's sons, whom the people made king of Judah in his father's stead (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 14:21; 2 Chr. 26:1</reflink>). His long reign of about fifty-two years was "the most prosperous excepting that of Jehosaphat since the time of Solomon." He was a vigorous and able ruler, and "his name spread abroad, even to the entering in of Egypt" (<reflink target="XXX">2 Chr. 26:8, 14</reflink>). In the earlier part of his reign, under the influence of Zechariah, he was faithful to Jehovah, and "did that which was right in the sight of the Lord" (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 15:3; 2 Chr. 26:4, 5</reflink>); but toward the close of his long life "his heart was lifted up to his destruction," and he wantonly invaded the priest's office (<reflink target="XXX">2 Chr. 26:16</reflink>), and entering the sanctuary proceeded to offer incense on the golden altar. Azariah the high priest saw the tendency of such a daring act on the part of the king, and with a band of eighty priests he withstood him (<reflink target="XXX">2 Chr. 26:17</reflink>), saying, "It appertaineth not unto thee, Uzziah, to burn incense." Uzziah was suddenly struck with leprosy while in the act of offering incense (26:19-21), and he was driven from the temple and compelled to reside in "a several house" to the day of his death (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 15:5, 27; 2 Chr. 26:3</reflink>). He was buried in a separate grave "in the field of the burial which belonged to the kings" (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 15:7; 2 Chr. 26:23</reflink>). "That lonely grave in the royal necropolis would eloquently testify to coming generations that all earthly monarchy must bow before the inviolable order of the divine will, and that no interference could be tolerated with that unfolding of the purposes of God, which, in the fulness of time, would reveal the Christ, the true High Priest and King for evermore" (Dr. Green's Kingdom of Israel, etc.).</description>

    <description>is said to be the oldest extant vellum manuscript. It and the Codex Sinaiticus are the two oldest uncial manuscripts. They were probably written in the fourth century. The Vaticanus was placed in the Vatican Library at Rome by Pope Nicolas V. in 1448, its previous history being unknown. It originally consisted in all probability of a complete copy of the Septuagint and of the New Testament. It is now imperfect, and consists of 759 thin, delicate leaves, of which the New Testament fills 142. Like the Sinaiticus, it is of the greatest value to Biblical scholars in aiding in the formation of a correct text of the New Testament. It is referred to by critics as Codex B.</description>

    <description>(2.) Massekah (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 25:7; in Isa. 28:20 rendered "covering"</reflink>). The word denotes something spread out and covering or concealing something else (comp. 2 Cor. 3:13-15).</description>

In the temple a partition wall separated these two places. In it were two folding-doors, which are supposed to have been always open, the entrance being concealed by the veil which the high priest lifted when he entered into the sanctuary on the day of Atonement.

  <item id="Version">
    <description>a translation of the holy Scriptures. This word is not found in the Bible, nevertheless, as frequent references are made in this work to various ancient as well as modern versions, it is fitting that some brief account should be given of the most important of these. These versions are important helps to the right interpretation of the Word. (See SAMARITAN PENTATEUCH</description>
    <description>1. The Targums. After the return from the Captivity, the Jews, no longer familiar with the old Hebrew, required that their Scriptures should be translated for them into the Chaldaic or Aramaic language and interpreted. These translations and paraphrases were at first oral, but they were afterwards reduced to writing, and thus targums, i.e., "versions" or "translations", have come down to us. The chief of these are, (1.) The Onkelos Targum, i.e., the targum of Akelas=Aquila, a targum so called to give it greater popularity by comparing it with the Greek translation of Aquila mentioned below. This targum originated about the second century after Christ. (2.) The targum of Jonathan ben Uzziel comes next to that of Onkelos in respect of age and value. It is more a paraphrase on the Prophets, however, than a translation. Both of these targums issued from the Jewish school which then flourished at Babylon.</description>
    <description>2. The Greek Versions. (1.) The oldest of these is the Septuagint, usually quoted as the LXX. The origin of this the most important of all the versions is involved in much obscurity. It derives its name from the popular notion that seventy-two translators were employed on it by the direction of Ptolemy Philadelphus, king of Egypt, and that it was accomplished in seventy-two days, for the use of the Jews residing in that country. There is no historical warrant for this notion. It is, however, an established fact that this version was made at Alexandria; that it was begun about 280 B.C., and finished about 200 or 150 B.C.; that it was the work of a number of translators who differed greatly both in their knowledge of Hebrew and of Greek; and that from the earliest times it has borne the name of "The Septuagint", i.e., The Seventy.</description>
    <description>"This version, with all its defects, must be of the greatest interest, (a) as preserving evidence for the text far more ancient than the oldest Hebrew manuscripts; (b) as the means by which the Greek Language was wedded to Hebrew thought; (c) as the source of the great majority of quotations from the Old Testament by writers of the New Testament.</description>
    <description>(2.) The New Testament manuscripts fall into two divisions, Uncials, written in Greek capitals, with no distinction at all between the different words, and very little even between the different lines; and Cursives, in small Greek letters, and with divisions of words and lines. The change between the two kinds of Greek writing took place about the tenth century. Only five manuscripts of the New Testament approaching to completeness are more ancient than this dividing date. The first, numbered A, is the Alexandrian manuscript. Though brought to this country by Cyril Lucar, patriarch of Constantinople, as a present to Charles I., it is believed that it was written, not in that capital, but in Alexandria; whence its title. It is now dated in the fifth century A.D. The second, known as B, is the Vatican manuscript. (<see target="x-self">See VATICANUS.</see>) The Third, C, or the Ephraem manuscript, was so called because it was written over the writings of Ephraem, a Syrian theological author, a practice very common in the days when writing materials were scarce and dear. It is believed that it belongs to the fifth century, and perhaps a slightly earlier period of it than the manuscript A. The fourth, D, or the manuscript of Beza, was so called because it belonged to the reformer Beza, who found it in the monastery of St. Irenaeus at Lyons in 1562 A.D. It is imperfect, and is dated in the sixth century. The fifth (called Aleph) is the Sinaitic manuscript. (<see target="x-self">See SINAITICUS.</see>)</description>
    <description>3. The Syriac Versions. (<see target="x-self">See SYRIAC.</see>)</description>
    <description>4. The Latin Versions. A Latin version of the Scriptures, called the "Old Latin," which originated in North Africa, was in common use in the time of Tertullian (A.D. 150). Of this there appear to have been various copies or recensions made. That made in Italy, and called the Itala, was reckoned the most accurate. This translation of the Old Testament seems to have been made not from the original Hebrew but from the LXX.</description>
    <description>This version became greatly corrupted by repeated transcription, and to remedy the evil Jerome (A.D. 329-420) was requested by Damasus, the bishop of Rome, to undertake a complete revision of it. It met with opposition at first, but was at length, in the seventh century, recognized as the "Vulgate" version. It appeared in a printed from about A.D. 1455, the first book that ever issued from the press. The Council of Trent (1546) declared it "authentic." It subsequently underwent various revisions, but that which was executed (1592) under the sanction of Pope Clement VIII. was adopted as the basis of all subsequent editions. It is regarded as the sacred original in the Roman Catholic Church. All modern European versions have been more or less influenced by the Vulgate. This version reads _ipsa_ instead of _ipse_ in Gen. 3:15, "She shall bruise thy head."</description>
    <description>5. There are several other ancient versions which are of importance for Biblical critics, but which we need not mention particularly, such as the Ethiopic, in the fourth century, from the LXX.; two Egyptian versions, about the fourth century, the Memphitic, circulated in Lower Egypt, and the Thebaic, designed for Upper Egypt, both from the Greek; the Gothic, written in the German language, but with the Greek alphabet, by Ulphilas (died A.D. 388), of which only fragments of the Old Testament remain; the Armenian, about A.D. 400; and the Slavonic, in the ninth century, for ancient Moravia. Other ancient versions, as the Arabic, the Persian, and the Anglo-Saxon, may be mentioned.</description>
    <description>6. The history of the English versions begins properly with Wyckliffe. Portions, however, of the Scriptures were rendered into Saxon (as the Gospel according to John, by Bede, A.D. 735), and also into English (by Orme, called the "Ormulum," a portion of the Gospels and of the Acts in the form of a metrical paraphrase, toward the close of the seventh century), long before Wyckliffe; but it is to him that the honour belongs of having first rendered the whole Bible into English (A.D. 1380). This version was made from the Vulgate, and renders Gen. 3:15 after that Version, "She shall trede thy head."</description>
    <description>This was followed by Tyndale's translation (1525-1531); Miles Coverdale's (1535-1553); Thomas Matthew's (1537), really, however, the work of John Rogers, the first martyr under the reign of Queen Mary. This was properly the first Authorized Version, Henry VIII. having ordered a copy of it to be got for every church. This took place in less than a year after Tyndale was martyred for the crime of translating the Scriptures. In 1539 Richard Taverner published a revised edition of Matthew's Bible. The Great Bible, so called from its great size, called also Cranmer's Bible, was published in 1539 and 1568. In the strict sense, the "Great Bible" is "the only authorized version; for the Bishops' Bible and the present Bible [the A.V.] never had the formal sanction of royal authority." Next in order was the Geneva version (1557-1560); the Bishops' Bible (1568); the Rheims and Douai versions, under Roman Catholic auspices (1582, 1609); the Authorized Version (1611); and the Revised Version of the New Testament in 1880 and of the Old Testament in 1884.</description>

  <item id="Vine">
    <description>one of the most important products of Palestine. The first mention of it is in the history of Noah (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 9:20</reflink>). It is afterwards frequently noticed both in the Old and New Testaments, and in the ruins of terraced vineyards there are evidences that it was extensively cultivated by the Jews. It was cultivated in Palestine before the Israelites took possession of it. The men sent out by Moses brought with them from the Valley of Eshcol a cluster of grapes so large that "they bare it between two upon a staff" (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 13: 23</reflink>). The vineyards of En-gedi (<reflink target="XXX">Cant. 1:14</reflink>), Heshbon, Sibmah, Jazer, Elealeh (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 16:8-10; Jer. 48:32, 34</reflink>), and Helbon (<reflink target="XXX">Ezek. 27:18</reflink>), as well as of Eshcol, were celebrated.</description>
    <description>The Church is compared to a vine (<reflink target="XXX">Ps. 80:8</reflink>), and Christ says of himself, "I am the vine" (<reflink target="XXX">John 15:1</reflink>). In one of his parables also (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 21:33</reflink>) our Lord compares his Church to a vineyard which "a certain householder planted, and hedged round about," etc.</description>
    <description>Hos. 10:1 is rendered in the Revised Version, "Israel is a luxuriant vine, which putteth forth his fruit," instead of "Israel is an empty vine, he bringeth forth fruit unto himself," of the Authorized Version.</description>

  <item id="Vine of Sodom">
    <description>referred to only in Deut. 32:32. Among the many conjectures as to this tree, the most probable is that it is the 'osher of the Arabs, which abounds in the region of the Dead Sea. Its fruit are the so-called "apples of Sodom," which, though beautiful to the eye, are exceedingly bitter to the taste. (See EN-GEDI</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Vinegar">
    <description>Heb. hometz, Gr. oxos, Fr. vin aigre; i.e., "sour wine." The Hebrew word is rendered vinegar in Ps. 69:21, a prophecy fulfilled in the history of the crucifixion (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 27:34</reflink>). This was the common sour wine (posea) daily made use of by the Roman soldiers. They gave it to Christ, not in derision, but from compassion, to assuage his thirst. Prov. 10:26 shows that there was also a stronger vinegar, which was not fit for drinking. The comparison, "vinegar upon nitre," probably means "vinegar upon soda" (as in the marg. of the R.V.), which then effervesces.</description>

  <item id="Viol">
    <description>Heb. nebel (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 5:12, R.V., "lute;" 14:11</reflink>), a musical instrument, usually rendered "psaltery" (q.v.)</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Viper">
    <description>In Job 20:16, Isa. 30:6; 59:5, the Heb. word eph'eh is thus rendered. The Hebrew word, however, probably denotes a species of poisonous serpents known by the Arabic name of 'el ephah. Tristram has identified it with the sand viper, a species of small size common in sandy regions, and frequently found under stones by the shores of the Dead Sea. It is rapid in its movements, and highly poisonous. In the New Testament _echidne_ is used (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 3:7; 12:34; 23:33</reflink>) for any poisonous snake. The viper mentioned in Acts 28:3 was probably the vipera aspis, or the Mediterranean viper. (<see target="x-self">See ADDER.</see>)</description>

The people of the land of Zidon are thus referred to by Isaiah (23:12), "O thou oppressed virgin, daughter of Zidon;" and of the people of Israel, Jeremiah (18:13) says, "The virgin of Israel hath done a very horrible thing."</description>

    <description>(1.) Heb. da'ah (<reflink target="XXX">Lev. 11:14</reflink>). In the parallel passage (<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 14:13</reflink>) the Hebrew word used is _ra'ah_, rendered "glede;" LXX., "gups;" Vulg., "milvus." A species of ravenous bird, distinguished for its rapid flight. "When used without the epithet 'red,' the name is commonly confined to the black kite. The habits of the bird bear out the allusion in Isa. 34:15, for it is, excepting during the winter three months, so numerous everywhere in Palestine as to be almost gregarious." (See EAGLE</description>
    <description>(2.) In Job 28:7 the Heb. 'ayyah is thus rendered. The word denotes a clamorous and a keen-sighted bird of prey. In Lev. 11:14 and Deut. 14:13 it is rendered "kite" (q.v.).</description>

  <item id="Wailing-place, Jews'">
    <description>a section of the western wall of the temple area, where the Jews assemble every Friday afternoon to bewail their desolate condition (<reflink target="XXX">Ps. 79:1, 4, 5</reflink>). The stones in this part of the wall are of great size, and were placed, as is generally believed, in the position in which they are now found in the time of Solomon. "The congregation at the wailing-place is one of the most solemn gatherings left to the Jewish Church, and as the writer gazed at the motley concourse he experienced a feeling of sorrow that the remnants of the chosen race should be heartlessly thrust outside the sacred enclosure of their fathers' holy temple by men of an alien race and an alien creed. Many of the elders, seated on the ground, with their backs against the wall, on the west side of the area, and with their faces turned toward the eternal house, read out of their well-thumbed Hebrew books passages from the prophetic writings, such as Isa. 64:9-12" (King's Recent Discoveries, etc.).

    <description>Questions of an intricate nature have been discussed regarding the "Wanderings," but it is enough for us to take the sacred narrative as it stands, and rest assured that "He led them forth by the right way" (<reflink target="XXX">Ps. 107:1-7, 33-35</reflink>).

  <item id="War">
    <description>The Israelites had to take possession of the Promised Land by conquest. They had to engage in a long and bloody war before the Canaanitish tribes were finally subdued. Except in the case of Jericho and Ai, the war did not become aggressive till after the death of Joshua. Till then the attack was always first made by the Canaanites. Now the measure of the iniquity of the Canaanites was full, and Israel was employed by God to sweep them away from off the face of the earth. In entering on this new stage of the war, the tribe of Judah, according to divine direction, took the lead.</description>
    <description>In the days of Saul and David the people of Israel engaged in many wars with the nations around, and after the division of the kingdom into two they often warred with each other. They had to defend themselves also against the inroads of the Egyptians, the Assyrians, and the Babylonians. The whole history of Israel from first to last presents but few periods of peace.</description>
    <description>The Christian life is represented as a warfare, and the Christian graces are also represented under the figure of pieces of armour (<reflink target="XXX">Eph. 6:11-17; 1 Thess. 5:8; 2 Tim. 2:3, 4</reflink>). The final blessedness of believers is attained as the fruit of victory (<reflink target="XXX">Rev. 3:21</reflink>).</description>

  <item id="Washing">
    <description>(<reflink target="XXX">Mark 7:1-9</reflink>). The Jews, like other Orientals, used their fingers when taking food, and therefore washed their hands before doing so, for the sake of cleanliness. Here the reference is to the ablutions prescribed by tradition, according to which "the disciples ought to have gone down to the side of the lake, washed their hands thoroughly, 'rubbing the fist of one hand in the hollow of the other, then placed the ten finger-tips together, holding the hands up, so that any surplus water might flow down to the elbow, and thence to the ground.'" To neglect to do this had come to be regarded as a great sin, a sin equal to the breach of any of the ten commandments. Moses had commanded washings oft, but always for some definite cause; but the Jews multiplied the legal observance till they formed a large body of precepts. To such precepts about ceremonial washing Mark here refers. (<see target="x-self">See ABLUTION.</see>)</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Watches">
    <description>the periods into which the time between sunset and sunrise was divided. They are so called because watchmen relieved each other at each of these periods. There are frequent references in Scripture to the duties of watchmen who were appointed to give notice of the approach of an enemy (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 18:24-27; 2 Kings 9:17-20; Isa. 21:5-9</reflink>). They were sometimes placed for this purpose on watch-towers (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 17:9; 18:8</reflink>). Ministers or teachers are also spoken of under this title (<reflink target="XXX">Jer. 6:17; Ezek. 33:2-9; Heb. 13:17</reflink>).</description>
    <description>The watches of the night were originally three in number, (1) "the beginning of the watches" (<reflink target="XXX">Lam. 2:19</reflink>); (2) "the middle watch" (<reflink target="XXX">Judg. 7:19</reflink>); and (3) "the morning watch" (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 14:24; 1 Sam. 11:11</reflink>), which extended from two o'clock to sunrise. But in the New Testament we read of four watches, a division probably introduced by the Romans (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 14:25; Mark 6:48; Luke 12:38</reflink>).

  <item id="Water of jealousy">
    <description>a phrase employed (not, however, in Scripture) to denote the water used in the solemn ordeal prescribed by the law of Moses (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 5:11-31</reflink>) in cases of "jealousy."</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Water of purification">
    <description>used in cases of ceremonial cleansings at the consecration of the Levites (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 8:7</reflink>). It signified, figuratively, that purifying of the heart which must characterize the servants of God.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Water of separation">
    <description>used along with the ashes of a red heifer for the ceremonial cleansing of persons defiled by contact with a dead body (Num. 19).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Waterspouts">
    <description>(<reflink target="XXX">Ps. 42:7; marg. R.V., "cataracts"</reflink>). If we regard this psalm as descriptive of David's feelings when banished from Jerusalem by the revolt of Absalom, this word may denote "waterfalls," inasmuch as Mahanaim, where he abode, was near the Jabbok, and the region abounded with rapids and falls.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Wave offerings">
    <description>parts of peace-offerings were so called, because they were waved by the priests (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 29:24, 26, 27; Lev. 7:20-34; 8:27; 9:21; 10:14, 15, etc.</reflink>), in token of a solemn special presentation to God. They then became the property of the priests. The first-fruits, a sheaf of barley, offered at the feast of Pentecost (<reflink target="XXX">Lev. 23:17-20</reflink>), and wheat-bread, the first-fruits of the second harvest, offered at the Passover (10-14), were wave-offerings.</description>

  <item id="Wean">
    <description>Among the Hebrews children (whom it was customary for the mothers to nurse, Ex. 2:7-9; 1 Sam. 1:23; Cant. 8:1) were not generally weaned till they were three or four years old.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Weasel">
    <description>(Heb. holedh), enumerated among unclean animals (<reflink target="XXX">Lev. 11:29</reflink>). Some think that this Hebrew word rather denotes the mole (Spalax typhlus) common in Palestine. There is no sufficient reason, however, to depart from the usual translation. The weasel tribe are common also in Palestine.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Weaving, weavers">
    <description>Weaving was an art practised in very early times (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 35:35</reflink>). The Egyptians were specially skilled in it (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 19:9; Ezek. 27:7</reflink>), and some have regarded them as its inventors.</description>
    <description>In the wilderness, the Hebrews practised it (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 26:1, 8; 28:4, 39; Lev. 13:47</reflink>). It is referred to in subsequent times as specially the women's work (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 23:7; Prov. 31:13, 24</reflink>). No mention of the loom is found in Scripture, but we read of the "shuttle" (<reflink target="XXX">Job 7:6</reflink>), "the pin" of the beam (<reflink target="XXX">Judg. 16:14</reflink>), "the web" (13, 14), and "the beam" (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 17:7; 2 Sam. 21:19</reflink>). The rendering, "with pining sickness," in Isa. 38:12 (A.V.) should be, as in the Revised Version, "from the loom," or, as in the margin, "from the thrum." We read also of the "warp" and "woof" (<reflink target="XXX">Lev. 13:48, 49, 51-53, 58, 59</reflink>), but the Revised Version margin has, instead of "warp," "woven or knitted stuff."</description>

    <description>From the beginning, time was divided into weeks, each consisting of six days of working and one of rest (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 2:2, 3; 7:10; 8:10, 12; 29:28</reflink>). The references to this division of days becomes afterwards more frequent (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 34:22; Lev. 12:5; Num. 28:26; Deut. 16:16; 2 Chr. 8:13; Jer. 5:24; Dan. 9:24-27; 10:2, 3</reflink>).

  <item id="Weights">
    <description>Reduced to English troy-weight, the Hebrew weights were: (1.) The gerah (<reflink target="XXX">Lev. 27:25; Num. 3:47</reflink>), a Hebrew word, meaning a grain or kernel, and hence a small weight. It was the twentieth part of a shekel, and equal to 12 grains.</description>
    <description>(2.) Bekah (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 38:26</reflink>), meaning "a half" i.e., "half a shekel," equal to 5 pennyweight.</description>
    <description>(3.) Shekel, "a weight," only in the Old Testament, and frequently in its original form (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 23:15, 16; Ex. 21:32; 30:13, 15; 38:24-29, etc.</reflink>). It was equal to 10 pennyweight.</description>
    <description>(4.) Ma'neh, "a part" or "portion" (<reflink target="XXX">Ezek. 45:12</reflink>), equal to 60 shekels, i.e., to 2 lbs. 6 oz.</description>
    <description>(5.) Talent of silver (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 5:22</reflink>), equal to 3,000 shekels, i.e., 125 lbs.</description>
    <description>(6.) Talent of gold (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 25:39</reflink>), double the preceding, i.e., 250 lbs.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Well">
    <description>(Heb. beer), to be distinguished from a fountain (Heb. 'ain). A "beer" was a deep shaft, bored far under the rocky surface by the art of man, which contained water which percolated through the strata in its sides. Such wells were those of Jacob and Beersheba, etc. (<reflink target="XXX">see Gen. 21:19, 25, 30, 31; 24:11; 26:15, 18-25, 32, etc.</reflink>). In the Pentateuch this word beer, so rendered, occurs twenty-five times.</description>

  </item>
  <item id="Whale">
    <description>The Hebrew word _tan_ (plural, tannin) is so rendered in Job 7:12 (A.V.; but R.V., "sea-monster"). It is rendered by "dragons" in Deut. 32:33; Ps. 91:13; Jer. 51:34; Ps. 74:13 (marg., "whales;" and marg. of R.V., "sea-monsters"); Isa. 27:1; and "serpent" in Ex. 7:9 (R.V. marg., "any large reptile," and so in ver. 10, 12). The words of Job (7:12), uttered in bitter irony, where he asks, "Am I a sea or a whale?" simply mean, "Have I a wild, untamable nature, like the waves of the sea, which must be confined and held within bounds, that they cannot pass?" "The serpent of the sea, which was but the wild, stormy sea itself, wound itself around the land, and threatened to swallow it up...Job inquires if he must be watched and plagued like this monster, lest he throw the world into disorder" (Davidson's Job).</description>
    <description>The whale tribe are included under the general Hebrew name _tannin_ (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 1:21; Lam. 4:3</reflink>). "Even the sea-monsters [tanninim] draw out the breast." The whale brings forth its young alive, and suckles them.</description>
    <description>It is to be noticed of the story of Jonah's being "three days and three nights in the whale's belly," as recorded in Matt. 12:40, that here the Gr. ketos means properly any kind of sea-monster of the shark or the whale tribe, and that in the book of Jonah (1:17) it is only said that "a great fish" was prepared to swallow Jonah. This fish may have been, therefore, some great shark. The white shark is known to frequent the Mediterranean Sea, and is sometimes found 30 feet in length.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Wheat">
    <description>one of the earliest cultivated grains. It bore the Hebrew name _hittah_, and was extensively cultivated in Palestine. There are various species of wheat. That which Pharaoh saw in his dream was the Triticum compositum, which bears several ears upon one stalk (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 41:5</reflink>). The "fat of the kidneys of wheat" (<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 32:14</reflink>), and the "finest of the wheat" (<reflink target="XXX">Ps. 81:16; 147:14</reflink>), denote the best of the kind. It was exported from Palestine in great quantities (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 5:11; Ezek. 27:17; Acts 12:20</reflink>).</description>
    <description>Parched grains of wheat were used for food in Palestine (<reflink target="XXX">Ruth 2:14; 1 Sam. 17:17; 2 Sam. 17:28</reflink>). The disciples, under the sanction of the Mosaic law (<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 23:25</reflink>), plucked ears of corn, and rubbing them in their hands, ate the grain unroasted (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 12:1; Mark 2:23; Luke 6:1</reflink>). Before any of the wheat-harvest, however, could be eaten, the first-fruits had to be presented before the Lord (<reflink target="XXX">Lev. 23:14</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Wheel">
    <description>(Heb. galgal; rendered "wheel" in Ps. 83:13, and "a rolling thing" in Isa. 17:13; R.V. in both, "whirling dust"). This word has been supposed to mean the wild artichoke, which assumes the form of a globe, and in autumn breaks away from its roots, and is rolled about by the wind in some places in great numbers.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="White">
    <description>a symbol of purity (<reflink target="XXX">2 Chr. 5:12; Ps. 51:7; Isa. 1:18; Rev. 3:18; 7:14</reflink>). Our Lord, at his transfiguration, appeared in raiment "white as the light" (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 17:2, etc.</reflink>).</description>

In the New Testament the same tender regard for them is inculcated (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 6:1-6; 1 Tim. 5:3-16</reflink>) and exhibited.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Wife">
    <description>The ordinance of marriage was sanctioned in Paradise (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 2:24; Matt. 19:4-6</reflink>). Monogamy was the original law under which man lived, but polygamy early commenced (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 4:19</reflink>), and continued to prevail all down through Jewish history. The law of Moses regulated but did not prohibit polygamy. A man might have a plurality of wives, but a wife could have only one husband. A wife's legal rights (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 21:10</reflink>) and her duties (<reflink target="XXX">Prov. 31:10-31; 1 Tim. 5:14</reflink>) are specified. She could be divorced in special cases (<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 22:13-21</reflink>), but could not divorce her husband. Divorce was restricted by our Lord to the single case of adultery (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 19:3-9</reflink>). The duties of husbands and wives in their relations to each other are distinctly set forth in the New Testament (<reflink target="XXX">1 Cor. 7:2-5; Eph. 5:22-33; Col. 3:18, 19; 1 Pet. 3:1-7</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Wilderness">
    <description>(1.) Heb. midhbar, denoting not a barren desert but a district or region suitable for pasturing sheep and cattle (<reflink target="XXX">Ps. 65:12; Isa. 42:11; Jer. 23:10; Joel 1:19; 2:22</reflink>); an uncultivated place. This word is used of the wilderness of Beersheba (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 21:14</reflink>), on the southern border of Palestine; the wilderness of the Red Sea (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 13:18</reflink>); of Shur (15:22), a portion of the Sinaitic peninsula; of Sin (17:1), Sinai (<reflink target="XXX">Lev. 7:38</reflink>), Moab (<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 2:8</reflink>), Judah (<reflink target="XXX">Judg. 1:16</reflink>), Ziph, Maon, En-gedi (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 23:14, 24; 24:1</reflink>), Jeruel and Tekoa (<reflink target="XXX">2 Chr. 20:16, 20</reflink>), Kadesh (<reflink target="XXX">Ps. 29:8</reflink>).</description>
    <description>"The wilderness of the sea" (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 21:1</reflink>). Principal Douglas, referring to this expression, says: "A mysterious name, which must be meant to describe Babylon (<see target="x-self">see especially ver. 9</see>), perhaps because it became the place of discipline to God's people, as the wilderness of the Red Sea had been (<reflink target="XXX">comp. Ezek. 20:35</reflink>). Otherwise it is in contrast with the symbolic title in Isa. 22:1. Jerusalem is the "valley of vision," rich in spiritual husbandry; whereas Babylon, the rival centre of influence, is spiritually barren and as restless as the sea (<reflink target="XXX">comp. 57:20</reflink>)."

    <description>(2.) Jeshimon, a desert waste (<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 32:10; Ps. 68:7</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(3.) 'Arabah, the name given to the valley from the Dead Sea to the eastern branch of the Red Sea. In Deut. 1:1; 2:8, it is rendered "plain" (R.V., "Arabah").</description>
    <description>(4.) Tziyyah, a "dry place" (<reflink target="XXX">Ps. 78:17; 105:41</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(5.) Tohu, a "desolate" place, a place "waste" or "unoccupied" (<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 32:10; Job 12:24; comp. Gen. 1:2, "without form"</reflink>). The wilderness region in the Sinaitic peninsula through which for forty years the Hebrews wandered is generally styled "the wilderness of the wanderings." This entire region is in the form of a triangle, having its base toward the north and its apex toward the south. Its extent from north to south is about 250 miles, and at its widest point it is about 150 miles broad. Throughout this vast region of some 1,500 square miles there is not a single river. The northern part of this triangular peninsula is properly the "wilderness of the wanderings" (et-Tih). The western portion of it is called the "wilderness of Shur" (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 15:22</reflink>), and the eastern the "wilderness of Paran."</description>
    <description>The "wilderness of Judea" (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 3:1</reflink>) is a wild, barren region, lying between the Dead Sea and the Hebron Mountains. It is the "Jeshimon" mentioned in 1 Sam. 23:19.</description>

  <item id="Willows">
    <description>(1.) Heb. 'arabim (<reflink target="XXX">Lev. 23:40; Job 40:22; Isa. 15:7; 44:3, 4; Ps. 137:1, 2</reflink>). This was supposed to be the weeping willow, called by Linnaeus Salix Babylonica, from the reference in Ps. 137. This tree is frequently found "on the coast, overhanging wells and pools. There is a conspicuous tree of this species over a pond in the plain of Acre, and others on the Phoenician plain." There are several species of the salix in Palestine, but it is not indigenous to Babylonia, nor was it cultivated there. Some are of opinion that the tree intended is the tamarisk or poplar.</description>
    <description>(2.) Heb. tzaphtzaphah (<reflink target="XXX">Ezek. 17:5</reflink>), called by the Arabs the safsaf, the general name for the willow. This may be the Salix AEgyptica of naturalists.</description>
    <description>Tristram thinks that by the "willow by the water-courses," the Nerium oleander, the rose-bay oleander, is meant. He says, "It fringes the Upper Jordan, dipping its wavy crown of red into the spray in the rapids under Hermon, and is nutured by the oozy marshes in the Lower Jordan nearly as far as to Jericho...On the Arnon, on the Jabbok, and the Yarmuk it forms a continuous fringe. In many of the streams of Moab it forms a complete screen, which the sun's rays can never penetrate to evaporate the precious moisture. The wild boar lies safely ensconced under its impervious cover."</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Wimple">
    <description>Isa. 3:22, (R.V., "shawls"), a wrap or veil. The same Hebrew word is rendered "vail" (R.V., "mantle") in Ruth 3:15.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Window">
    <description>properly only an opening in a house for the admission of light and air, covered with lattice-work, which might be opened or closed (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 1:2; Acts 20:9</reflink>). The spies in Jericho and Paul at Damascus were let down from the windows of houses abutting on the town wall (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 2:15; 2 Cor. 11:33</reflink>). The clouds are metaphorically called the "windows of heaven" (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 7:11; Mal. 3:10</reflink>). The word thus rendered in Isa. 54:12 ought rather to be rendered "battlements" (LXX., "bulwarks;" R.V., "pinnacles"), or as Gesenius renders it, "notched battlements, i.e., suns or rays of the sun"= having a radiated appearance like the sun.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Winds">
    <description>blowing from the four quarters of heaven (<reflink target="XXX">Jer. 49:36; Ezek. 37:9; Dan. 8:8; Zech. 2:6</reflink>). The east wind was parching (<reflink target="XXX">Ezek. 17:10; 19:12</reflink>), and is sometimes mentioned as simply denoting a strong wind (<reflink target="XXX">Job 27:21; Isa. 27:8</reflink>). This wind prevails in Palestine from February to June, as the west wind (<reflink target="XXX">Luke 12:54</reflink>) does from November to February. The south was a hot wind (<reflink target="XXX">Job 37:17; Luke 12:55</reflink>). It swept over the Arabian peninsula. The rush of invaders is figuratively spoken of as a whirlwind (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 21:1</reflink>); a commotion among the nations of the world as a striving of the four winds (<reflink target="XXX">Dan. 7:2</reflink>). The winds are subject to the divine power (<reflink target="XXX">Ps. 18:10; 135:7</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Wine">
    <description>The common Hebrew word for wine is _yayin_, from a root meaning "to boil up," "to be in a ferment." Others derive it from a root meaning "to tread out," and hence the juice of the grape trodden out. The Greek word for wine is _oinos_, and the Latin _vinun_. But besides this common Hebrew word, there are several others which are thus rendered.</description>
    <description>(1.) Ashishah (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 6:19; 1 Chr. 16:3; Cant. 2:5; Hos. 3:1</reflink>), which, however, rather denotes a solid cake of pressed grapes, or, as in the Revised Version, a cake of raisins.</description>
    <description>(2.) 'Asis, "sweet wine," or "new wine," the product of the same year (<reflink target="XXX">Cant. 8:2; Isa. 49:26; Joel 1:5; 3:18; Amos 9:13</reflink>), from a root meaning "to tread," hence juice trodden out or pressed out, thus referring to the method by which the juice is obtained. The power of intoxication is ascribed to it.</description>
    <description>(3.) Hometz. See VINEGAR.</description>
    <description>(4.) Hemer, Deut. 32:14 (rendered "blood of the grape") Isa. 27:2 ("red wine"), Ezra 6:9; 7:22; Dan. 5:1, 2, 4. This word conveys the idea of "foaming," as in the process of fermentation, or when poured out. It is derived from the root _hamar_, meaning "to boil up," and also "to be red," from the idea of boiling or becoming inflamed.</description>
    <description>(5.) 'Enabh, a grape (<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 32:14</reflink>). The last clause of this verse should be rendered as in the Revised Version, "and of the blood of the grape ['enabh] thou drankest wine [hemer]." In Hos. 3:1 the phrase in Authorized Version, "flagons of wine," is in the Revised Version correctly "cakes of raisins." (<reflink target="XXX">Comp. Gen. 49:11; Num. 6:3; Deut. 23:24, etc., where this Hebrew word is rendered in the plural "grapes."</reflink>)</description>
    <description>(6.) Mesekh, properly a mixture of wine and water with spices that increase its stimulating properties (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 5:22</reflink>). Ps. 75:8, "The wine [yayin] is red; it is full of mixture [mesekh];" Prov. 23:30, "mixed wine;" Isa. 65:11, "drink offering" (R.V., "mingled wine").</description>
    <description>(7.) Tirosh, properly "must," translated "wine" (<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 28:51</reflink>); "new wine" (<reflink target="XXX">Prov. 3:10</reflink>); "sweet wine" (<reflink target="XXX">Micah 6:15; R.V., "vintage"</reflink>). This Hebrew word has been traced to a root meaning "to take possession of" and hence it is supposed that tirosh is so designated because in intoxicating it takes possession of the brain. Among the blessings promised to Esau (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 27:28</reflink>) mention is made of "plenty of corn and tirosh." Palestine is called "a land of corn and tirosh" (<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 33:28; comp. Isa. 36:17</reflink>). See also Deut. 28:51; 2 Chr. 32:28; Joel 2:19; Hos. 4:11, ("wine [yayin] and new wine [tirosh] take away the heart").</description>
    <description>(8.) Sobhe (root meaning "to drink to excess," "to suck up," "absorb"), found only in Isa. 1:22, Hos. 4:18 ("their drink;" Gesen. and marg. of R.V., "their carouse"), and Nah. 1:10 ("drunken as drunkards;" lit., "soaked according to their drink;" R.V., "drenched, as it were, in their drink", i.e., according to their sobhe).</description>
    <description>(9.) Shekar, "strong drink," any intoxicating liquor; from a root meaning "to drink deeply," "to be drunken", a generic term applied to all fermented liquors, however obtained. Num. 28:7, "strong wine" (R.V., "strong drink"). It is sometimes distinguished from wine, c.g., Lev. 10:9, "Do not drink wine [yayin] nor strong drink [shekar];" Num. 6:3; Judg. 13:4, 7; Isa. 28:7 (in all these places rendered "strong drink"). Translated "strong drink" also in Isa. 5:11; 24:9; 29:9; 56:12; Prov. 20:1; 31:6; Micah 2:11.</description>
    <description>(10.) Yekebh (<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 16:13, but in R.V. correctly "wine-press"</reflink>), a vat into which the new wine flowed from the press. Joel 2:24, "their vats;" 3:13, "the fats;" Prov. 3:10, "Thy presses shall burst out with new wine [tirosh];" Hag. 2:16; Jer. 48:33, "wine-presses;" 2 Kings 6:27; Job. 24:11.</description>
    <description>(11.) Shemarim (only in plural), "lees" or "dregs" of wine. In Isa. 25:6 it is rendered "wines on the lees", i.e., wine that has been kept on the lees, and therefore old wine.</description>
    <description>(12.) Mesek, "a mixture," mixed or spiced wine, not diluted with water, but mixed with drugs and spices to increase its strength, or, as some think, mingled with the lees by being shaken (<reflink target="XXX">Ps. 75:8; Prov. 23:30</reflink>).</description>
    <description>In Acts 2:13 the word _gleukos_, rendered "new wine," denotes properly "sweet wine." It must have been intoxicating.</description>
    <description>In addition to wine the Hebrews also made use of what they called _debash_, which was obtained by boiling down must to one-half or one-third of its original bulk. In Gen. 43:11 this word is rendered "honey." It was a kind of syrup, and is called by the Arabs at the present day dibs. This word occurs in the phrase "a land flowing with milk and honey" (debash), Ex. 3:8, 17; 13:5; 33:3; Lev. 20:24; Num. 13: 27. (<see target="x-self">See HONEY.</see>)</description>
    <description>Our Lord miraculously supplied wine at the marriage feast in Cana of Galilee (<reflink target="XXX">John 2:1-11</reflink>). The Rechabites were forbidden the use of wine (Jer. 35). The Nazarites also were to abstain from its use during the period of their vow (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 6:1-4</reflink>); and those who were dedicated as Nazarites from their birth were perpetually to abstain from it (<reflink target="XXX">Judg. 13:4, 5; Luke 1:15; 7:33</reflink>). The priests, too, were forbidden the use of wine and strong drink when engaged in their sacred functions (<reflink target="XXX">Lev. 10:1, 9-11</reflink>). "Wine is little used now in the East, from the fact that Mohammedans are not allowed to taste it, and very few of other creeds touch it. When it is drunk, water is generally mixed with it, and this was the custom in the days of Christ also. The people indeed are everywhere very sober in hot climates; a drunken person, in fact, is never seen", (Geikie's Life of Christ). The sin of drunkenness, however, must have been not uncommon in the olden times, for it is mentioned either metaphorically or literally more than seventy times in the Bible.</description>
    <description>A drink-offering of wine was presented with the daily sacrifice (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 29:40, 41</reflink>), and also with the offering of the first-fruits (<reflink target="XXX">Lev. 23:13</reflink>), and with various other sacrifices (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 15:5, 7, 10</reflink>). Wine was used at the celebration of the Passover. And when the Lord's Supper was instituted, the wine and the unleavened bread then on the paschal table were by our Lord set apart as memorials of his body and blood.</description>
    <description>Several emphatic warnings are given in the New Testament against excess in the use of wine (<reflink target="XXX">Luke 21:34; Rom. 13:13; Eph. 5:18; 1 Tim. 3:8; Titus 1:7</reflink>).</description>

  <item id="Wine-press">
    <description>Consisted of two vats or receptacles, (1) a trough (Heb. gath, Gr. lenos) into which the grapes were thrown and where they were trodden upon and bruised (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 16:10; Lam. 1:15; Joel 3:13</reflink>); and (2) a trough or vat (Heb. yekebh, Gr. hypolenion) into which the juice ran from the trough above, the gath (<reflink target="XXX">Neh. 13:15; Job 24:11; Isa. 63:2, 3; Hag. 2:16; Joel 2:24</reflink>). Wine-presses are found in almost every part of Palestine. They are "the only sure relics we have of the old days of Israel before the Captivity. Between Hebron and Beersheba they are found on all the hill slopes; they abound in southern Judea; they are no less common in the many valleys of Carmel; and they are numerous in Galilee." The "treading of the wine-press" is emblematic of divine judgment (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 63:2; Lam. 1:15; Rev. 14:19, 20</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Winefat">
    <description>(<reflink target="XXX">Mark 12:1</reflink>). The original word (hypolenion) so rendered occurs only here in the New Testament. It properly denotes the trough or lake (lacus), as it was called by the Romans, into which the juice of the grapes ran from the trough above it. It is here used, however, of the whole apparatus. In the parallel passage in Matt. 21:33 the Greek word _lenos_ is used. This properly denotes the upper one of the two vats. (See WINE-PRESS</description>

  <item id="Winnow">
    <description>Corn was winnowed, (1.) By being thrown up by a shovel against the wind. As a rule this was done in the evening or during the night, when the west wind from the sea was blowing, which was a moderate breeze and fitted for the purpose. The north wind was too strong, and the east wind came in gusts. (2.) By the use of a fan or van, by which the chaff was blown away (<reflink target="XXX">Ruth 3:2; Isa. 30:24; Jer. 4:11, 12; Matt. 3:12</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Wise men">
    <description>mentioned in Dan. 2:12 included three classes, (1) astrologers, (2) Chaldeans, and (3) soothsayers. The word in the original (hakamim) probably means "medicine men. In Chaldea medicine was only a branch of magic. The "wise men" of Matt. 2:7, who came from the East to Jerusalem, were magi from Persia or Arabia.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Wise, wisdom">
    <description>a moral rather than an intellectual quality. To be "foolish" is to be godless (<reflink target="XXX">Ps. 14:1; comp. Judg. 19:23; 2 Sam. 13:13</reflink>). True wisdom is a gift from God to those who ask it (<reflink target="XXX">Job 28:12-28; Prov. 3:13-18; Rom. 1:22; 16:27; 1 Cor. 1:17-21; 2:6-8; James 1:5</reflink>). "Wisdom" in Prov. 1:20; 8:1; 9:1-5 may be regarded not as a mere personification of the attribute of wisdom, but as a divine person, "Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God" (<reflink target="XXX">1 Cor. 1:24</reflink>). In Matt. 11:19 it is the personified principle of wisdom that is meant.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Witch">
    <description>Occurs only in Ex. 22:18, as the rendering of _mekhashshepheh_, the feminine form of the word, meaning "enchantress" (R.V., "sorceress"), and in Deut. 18:10, as the rendering of _mekhashshepheth_, the masculine form of the word, meaning "enchanter."</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Witchcraft">
    <description>(<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 15:23; 2 Kings 9:22; 2 Chr. 33:6; Micah 5:12; Nahum 3:4; Gal. 5:20</reflink>). In the popular sense of the word no mention is made either of witches or of witchcraft in Scripture.</description>
    <description>The "witch of En-dor" (1 Sam. 28) was a necromancer, i.e., one who feigned to hold converse with the dead. The damsel with "a spirit of divination" (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 16:16</reflink>) was possessed by an evil spirit, or, as the words are literally rendered, "having a spirit, a pithon." The reference is to the heathen god Apollo, who was regarded as the god of prophecy.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Witness">
    <description>More than one witness was required in criminal cases (<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 17:6; 19:15</reflink>). They were the first to execute the sentence on the condemned (<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 13:9; 17:7; 1 Kings 21:13; Matt. 27:1; Acts 7:57, 58</reflink>). False witnesses were liable to punishment (<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 19:16-21</reflink>). It was also an offence to refuse to bear witness (<reflink target="XXX">Lev. 5:1</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Witness of the Spirit">
    <description>(<reflink target="XXX">Rom. 8:16</reflink>), the consciousness of the gracious operation of the Spirit on the mind, "a certitude of the Spirit's presence and work continually asserted within us", manifested "in his comforting us, his stirring us up to prayer, his reproof of our sins, his drawing us to works of love, to bear testimony before the world," etc.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Wizard">
    <description>a pretender to supernatural knowledge and power, "a knowing one," as the original Hebrew word signifies. Such an one was forbidden on pain of death to practise his deceptions (<reflink target="XXX">Lev. 19:31; 20:6, 27; 1 Sam. 28:3; Isa. 8:19; 19:3</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Wolf">
    <description>Heb. zeeb, frequently referred to in Scripture as an emblem of treachery and cruelty. Jacob's prophecy, "Benjamin shall ravin as a wolf" (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 49:27</reflink>), represents the warlike character of that tribe (<see target="x-self">see Judg. 19-21</see>). Isaiah represents the peace of Messiah's kingdom by the words, "The wolf also shall dwell with the lamb" (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 11:6</reflink>). The habits of the wolf are described in Jer. 5:6; Hab. 1:8; Zeph. 3:3; Ezek. 22:27; Matt. 7:15; 10:16; Acts 20:29. Wolves are still sometimes found in Palestine, and are the dread of shepherds, as of old.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Woman">
    <description>was "taken out of man" (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 2:23</reflink>), and therefore the man has the preeminence. "The head of the woman is the man;" but yet honour is to be shown to the wife, "as unto the weaker vessel" (<reflink target="XXX">1 Cor. 11:3, 8, 9; 1 Pet. 3:7</reflink>). Several women are mentioned in Scripture as having been endowed with prophetic gifts, as Miriam (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 15:20</reflink>), Deborah (<reflink target="XXX">Judg. 4:4, 5</reflink>), Huldah (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 22:14</reflink>), Noadiah (<reflink target="XXX">Neh. 6:14</reflink>), Anna (<reflink target="XXX">Luke 2:36, 37</reflink>), and the daughters of Philip the evangelist (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 21:8, 9</reflink>). Women are forbidden to teach publicly (<reflink target="XXX">1 Cor. 14:34, 35; 1 Tim. 2:11, 12</reflink>). Among the Hebrews it devolved upon women to prepare the meals for the household (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 18:6; 2 Sam. 13:8</reflink>), to attend to the work of spinning (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 35:26; Prov. 31:19</reflink>), and making clothes (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 2:19; Prov. 31:21</reflink>), to bring water from the well (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 24:15; 1 Sam. 9:11</reflink>), and to care for the flocks (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 29:6; Ex. 2:16</reflink>).</description>
    <description>The word "woman," as used in Matt. 15:28, John 2:4 and 20:13, 15, implies tenderness and courtesy and not disrespect. Only where revelation is known has woman her due place of honour assigned to her.</description>

  </item>
  <item id="Wood-offering">
    <description>(<reflink target="XXX">Neh. 10:34; 13:31</reflink>). It would seem that in the time of Nehemiah arrangements were made, probably on account of the comparative scarcity of wood, by which certain districts were required, as chosen by lot, to furnish wood to keep the altar fire perpetually burning (<reflink target="XXX">Lev. 6:13</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Wool">
    <description>one of the first material used for making woven cloth (<reflink target="XXX">Lev. 13:47, 48, 52, 59; 19:19</reflink>). The first-fruit of wool was to be offered to the priests (<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 18:4</reflink>). The law prohibiting the wearing of a garment "of divers sorts, as of woollen and linen together" (<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 22:11</reflink>) may, like some other laws of a similar character, have been intended to express symbolically the separateness and simplicity of God's covenant people. The wool of Damascus, famous for its whiteness, was of great repute in the Tyrian market (<reflink target="XXX">Ezek. 27:18</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Word of God">
    <description>(<reflink target="XXX">Heb. 4:12, etc.</reflink>). The Bible so called because the writers of its several books were God's organs in communicating his will to men. It is his "word," because he speaks to us in its sacred pages. Whatever the inspired writers here declare to be true and binding upon us, God declares to be true and binding. This word is infallible, because written under the guidance of the Holy Spirit, and therefore free from all error of fact or doctrine or precept. (<see target="x-self">See INSPIRATION; BIBLE.</see>) All saving knowledge is obtained from the word of God. In the case of adults it is an indispensable means of salvation, and is efficacious thereunto by the gracious influence of the Holy Spirit (<reflink target="XXX">John 17:17; 2 Tim. 3:15, 16; 1 Pet. 1:23</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Word, The">
    <description>(Gr. Logos), one of the titles of our Lord, found only in the writings of John (<reflink target="XXX">John 1:1-14; 1 John 1:1; Rev. 19:13</reflink>). As such, Christ is the revealer of God. His office is to make God known. "No man hath seen God at any time; the only begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared him" (<reflink target="XXX">John 1:18</reflink>). This title designates the divine nature of Christ. As the Word, he "was in the beginning" and "became flesh." "The Word was with God " and "was God," and was the Creator of all things (<reflink target="XXX">comp. Ps.33: 6; 107:20; 119:89; 147:18; Isa. 40:8</reflink>).</description>

  <item id="Works, Covenant of">
    <description>entered into by God with Adam as the representative of the human race (<reflink target="XXX">comp. Gen. 9:11, 12; 17:1-21</reflink>), so styled because perfect obedience was its condition, thus distinguishing it from the covenant of grace. (<see target="x-self">See COVENANT OF WORKS.</see>)</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Works, Good">
    <description>The old objection against the doctrine of salvation by grace, that it does away with the necessity of good works, and lowers the sense of their importance (Rom. 6), although it has been answered a thousand times, is still alleged by many. They say if men are not saved by works, then works are not necessary. If the most moral of men are saved in the same way as the very chief of sinners, then good works are of no moment. And more than this, if the grace of God is most clearly displayed in the salvation of the vilest of men, then the worse men are the better.</description>
    <description>The objection has no validity. The gospel of salvation by grace shows that good works are necessary. It is true, unchangeably true, that without holiness no man shall see the Lord. "Neither adulterers, nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards" shall inherit the kingdom of God.</description>
    <description>Works are "good" only when, (1) they spring from the principle of love to God. The moral character of an act is determined by the moral principle that prompts it. Faith and love in the heart are the essential elements of all true obedience. Hence good works only spring from a believing heart, can only be wrought by one reconciled to God (<reflink target="XXX">Eph. 2:10; James 2:18:22</reflink>). (2.) Good works have the glory of God as their object; and (3) they have the revealed will of God as their only rule (<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 12:32; Rev. 22:18, 19</reflink>).</description>
    <description>Good works are an expression of gratitude in the believer's heart (<reflink target="XXX">John 14:15, 23; Gal. 5:6</reflink>). They are the fruits of the Spirit (<reflink target="XXX">Titus 2:10-12</reflink>), and thus spring from grace, which they illustrate and strengthen in the heart.</description>
    <description>Good works of the most sincere believers are all imperfect, yet like their persons they are accepted through the mediation of Jesus Christ (<reflink target="XXX">Col. 3:17</reflink>), and so are rewarded; they have no merit intrinsically, but are rewarded wholly of grace.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Worm">
    <description>(1.) Heb. sas (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 51:8</reflink>), denotes the caterpillar of the clothes-moth.</description>
    <description>(2.) The manna bred worms (tola'im), but on the Sabbath there was not any worm (rimmah) therein (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 16:20, 24</reflink>). Here these words refer to caterpillars or larvae, which feed on corrupting matter.</description>
    <description>These two Hebrew words appear to be interchangeable (<reflink target="XXX">Job 25:6; Isa. 14:11</reflink>). Tola'im in some places denotes the caterpillar (<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 28:39; Jonah 4:7</reflink>), and rimmah, the larvae, as bred from putridity (<reflink target="XXX">Job 17:14; 21:26; 24:20</reflink>). In Micah 7:17, where it is said, "They shall move out of their holes like worms," perhaps serpents or "creeping things," or as in the Revised Version, "crawling things," are meant.</description>
    <description>The word is used figuratively in Job 25:6; Ps. 22:6; Isa. 41:14; Mark 9:44, 46, 48; Isa. 66:24.</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Wormwood">
    <description>Heb. la'anah, the Artemisia absinthium of botanists. It is noted for its intense bitterness (<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 29:18; Prov. 5:4; Jer. 9:15; Amos 5:7</reflink>). It is a type of bitterness, affliction, remorse, punitive suffering. In Amos 6:12 this Hebrew word is rendered "hemlock" (R.V., "wormwood"). In the symbolical language of the Apocalypse (<reflink target="XXX">Rev. 8:10, 11</reflink>) a star is represented as falling on the waters of the earth, causing the third part of the water to turn wormwood.</description>
    <description>The name by which the Greeks designated it, absinthion, means "undrinkable." The absinthe of France is distilled from a species of this plant. The "southernwood" or "old man," cultivated in cottage gardens on account of its fragrance, is another species of it.</description>

  <item id="Worship">
    <description>homage rendered to God which it is sinful (idolatry) to render to any created being (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 34:14; Isa. 2:8</reflink>).

  <item id="Writing">
    <description>The art of writing must have been known in the time of the early Pharaohs. Moses is commanded "to write for a memorial in a book" (<reflink target="XXX">Ex. 17:14</reflink>) a record of the attack of Amalek. Frequent mention is afterwards made of writing (28:11, 21, 29, 36; 31:18; 32:15, 16; 34:1, 28; 39:6, 14, 30). The origin of this art is unknown, but there is reason to conclude that in the age of Moses it was well known. The inspired books of Moses are the most ancient extant writings, although there are written monuments as old as about B.C. 2000. The words expressive of "writing," "book," and "ink," are common to all the branches or dialects of the Semitic language, and hence it has been concluded that this art must have been known to the earliest Semites before they separated into their various tribes, and nations, and families.</description>
    <description>"The Old Testament and the discoveries of Oriental archaeology alike tell us that the age of the Exodus was throughout the world of Western Asia an age of literature and books, of readers and writers, and that the cities of Palestine were stored with the contemporaneous records of past events inscribed on imperishable clay. They further tell us that the kinsfolk and neighbours of the Israelites were already acquainted with alphabetic writing, that the wanderers in the desert and the tribes of Edom were in contact with the cultured scribes and traders of Ma'in [Southern Arabia], and that the 'house of bondage' from which Israel had escaped was a land where the art of writing was blazoned not only on the temples of the gods, but also on the dwellings of the rich and powerful.", Sayce. (<see target="x-self">See DEBIR; PHOENICIA.</see>)</description>
    <description>The "Book of the Dead" was a collection of prayers and formulae, by the use of which the souls of the dead were supposed to attain to rest and peace in the next world. It was composed at various periods from the earliest time to the Persian conquest. It affords an interesting glimpse into the religious life and system of belief among the ancient Egyptians. We learn from it that they believed in the existence of one Supreme Being, the immortality of the soul, judgement after death, and the resurrection of the body. It shows, too, a high state of literary activity in Egypt in the time of Moses. It refers to extensive libraries then existing. That of Ramessium, in Thebes, e.g., built by Rameses II., contained 20,000 books.</description>
    <description>When the Hebrews entered Canaan it is evident that the art of writing was known to the original inhabitants, as appears, e.g., from the name of the city Debir having been at first Kirjath-sepher, i.e., the "city of the book," or the "book town" (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 10:38; 15:15; Judg. 1:11</reflink>).</description>
    <description>The first mention of letter-writing is in the time of David (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 11:14, 15</reflink>). Letters are afterwards frequently spoken of (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 21:8, 9, 11; 2 Kings 10:1, 3, 6, 7; 19:14; 2 Chr. 21:12-15; 30:1, 6-9, etc.</reflink>).</description>

  <item id="Yarn">
    <description>Found only in 1 Kings 10:28, 2 Chr. 1:16. The Heb. word mikveh, i.e., "a stringing together," so rendered, rather signifies a host, or company, or a string of horses. The Authorized Version has: "And Solomon had horses brought out of Egypt, and linen yarn: the king's merchants received the linen yarn at a price;" but the Revised Version correctly renders: "And the horses which Solomon had were brought out of Egypt; the king's merchants received them in droves, each drove at a price."</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Year">
    <description>Heb. shanah, meaning "repetition" or "revolution" (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 1:14; 5:3</reflink>). Among the ancient Egyptians the year consisted of twelve months of thirty days each, with five days added to make it a complete revolution of the earth round the sun. The Jews reckoned the year in two ways, (1) according to a sacred calendar, in which the year began about the time of the vernal equinox, with the month Abib; and (2) according to a civil calendar, in which the year began about the time of the autumnal equinox, with the month Nisan. The month Tisri is now the beginning of the Jewish year.</description>

    <description>(2.) In Jer. 27:2; 28:10, 12 the word in the Authorized Version rendered "yoke" is _motah_, which properly means a "staff," or as in the Revised Version, "bar."</description>
    <description>These words in the Hebrew are both used figuratively of severe bondage, or affliction, or subjection (<reflink target="XXX">Lev. 26:13; 1 Kings 12:4; Isa. 47:6; Lam. 1:14; 3:27</reflink>). In the New Testament the word "yoke" is also used to denote servitude (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 11:29, 30; Acts 15:10; Gal. 5:1</reflink>).</description>
    <description>(3.) In 1 Sam. 11:7, 1 Kings 19:21, Job 1:3 the word thus translated is _tzemed_, which signifies a pair, two oxen yoked or coupled together, and hence in 1 Sam. 14:14 it represents as much land as a yoke of oxen could plough in a day, like the Latin _jugum_. In Isa. 5:10 this word in the plural is translated "acres."</description>

  <item id="Yoke-fellow">
    <description>(<reflink target="XXX">Phil. 4:3</reflink>), one of the apostle's fellow-labourers. Some have conjectured that Epaphroditus is meant. Wyckliffe renders the phrase "the german felowe", i.e., "thee, germane [=genuine] comrade."</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Zaanaim">
    <description>wanderings; the unloading of tents, so called probably from the fact of nomads in tents encamping amid the cities and villages of that region, a place in the north-west of Lake Merom, near Kedesh, in Naphtali. Here Sisera was slain by Jael, "the wife of Heber the Kenite," who had pitched his tent in the "plain [R.V., 'as far as the oak'] of Zaanaim" (<reflink target="XXX">Judg. 4:11</reflink>).</description>
    <description>It has been, however, suggested by some that, following the LXX. and the Talmud, the letter b, which in Hebrew means "in," should be taken as a part of the word following, and the phrase would then be "unto the oak of Bitzanaim," a place which has been identified with the ruins of Bessum, about half-way between Tiberias and Mount Tabor.</description>

  <item id="Zaanan">

    <description>(3.) The son of Shemath. He conspired against Joash, king of Judah, and slew him (<reflink target="XXX">2 Chr. 24:25, 26</reflink>). He is called also Jozachar (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 12:21</reflink>).</description>

  <item id="Zacchaeus">
    <description>pure, a superintendant of customs; a chief tax-gather (publicanus) at Jericho (<reflink target="XXX">Luke 19:1-10</reflink>). "The collection of customs at Jericho, which at this time produced and exported a considerable quantity of balsam, was undoubtedly an important post, and would account for Zacchaeus being a rich man." Being short of stature, he hastened on before the multitude who were thronging about Christ as he passed through Jericho on his way to Jerusalem, and climbed up a sycamore tree that he might be able to see him. When our Lord reached the spot he looked up to the publican among the branches, and addressing him by name, told him to make haste and come down, as he intended that day to abide at his house. This led to the remarkable interview recorded by the evangelist, and to the striking parable of the ten pounds (<reflink target="XXX">Luke 19:12-27</reflink>). At Er-riha (Jericho) there is a large, venerable looking square tower, which goes by the traditional name of the House of Zacchaeus.</description>

  <item id="Zachariah">
    <description>remembered by the Lord. (1.) Son of Jeroboam II., king of Israel. On the death of his father there was an interregnum of ten years, at the end of which he succeeded to the throne, which he occupied only six months, having been put to death by Shallum, who usurped the throne. "He did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord, as his fathers had done" (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 14:29; 15:8-12</reflink>). In him the dynasty of Jehu came to an end.</description>
    <description>(2.) The father of Abi, who was the mother of Hezekiah (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 18:2</reflink>).</description>
  </item>
  <item id="Zacharias">
    <description>(1.) A priest of the course of Abia, the eighth of the twenty-four courses into which the priests had been originally divided by David (<reflink target="XXX">1 Chr. 23:1-19</reflink>). Only four of these courses or "families" of the priests returned from the Exile (<reflink target="XXX">Ezra 2:36-39</reflink>); but they were then re-distributed under the old designations. The priests served at the temple twice each year, and only for a week each time. Zacharias's time had come for this service. During this period his home would be one of the chambers set apart for the priests on the sides of the temple ground. The offering of incense was one of the most solemn parts of the daily worship of the temple, and lots were drawn each day to determine who should have this great honour, an honour which no priest could enjoy more than once during his lifetime.</description>
    <description>While Zacharias ministered at the golden altar of incense in the holy place, it was announced to him by the angel Gabriel that his wife Elisabeth, who was also of a priestly family, now stricken in years, would give birth to a son who was to be called John, and that he would be the forerunner of the long-expected Messiah (<reflink target="XXX">Luke 1:12-17</reflink>). As a punishment for his refusing to believe this message, he was struck dumb and "not able to speak until the day that these things should be performed" (20). Nine months passed away, and Elisabeth's child was born, and when in answer to their inquiry Zacharias wrote on a "writing tablet," "His name is John," his mouth was opened, and he praised God (60-79). The child (John the Baptist), thus "born out of due time," "waxed strong in spirit" (1:80).</description>
    <description>(2.) The "son of Barachias," mentioned as having been slain between the temple and the altar (<reflink target="XXX">Matt. 23:35; Luke 11:51</reflink>). "Barachias" here may be another name for Jehoiada, as some think. (<see target="x-self">See ZECHARIAH.</see>)</description>

    <description>righteous. (1.) A son of Ahitub, of the line of Eleazer (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 8:17; 1 Chr. 24:3</reflink>), high priest in the time of David (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 20:25</reflink>) and Solomon (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 4:4</reflink>). He is first mentioned as coming to take part with David at Hebron (<reflink target="XXX">1 Chr. 12:27, 28</reflink>). He was probably on this account made ruler over the Aaronites (27:17). Zadok and Abiathar acted as high priests on several important occasions (<reflink target="XXX">1 Chr. 15:11; 2 Sam. 15:24-29, 35, 36</reflink>); but when Adonijah endeavoured to secure the throne, Abiathar went with him, and therefore Solomon "thrust him out from being high priest," and Zadok, remaining faithful to David, became high priest alone (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 2:27, 35; 1 Chr. 29:22</reflink>). In him the line of Phinehas resumed the dignity, and held it till the fall of Jerusalem. He was succeeded in his sacred office by his son Azariah (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 4:2; comp. 1 Chr. 6:3-9</reflink>).</description>

A wood near Shechem, from which Abimelech and his party brought boughs and "put them to the hold" of Shechem, "and set the hold on fire" (<reflink target="XXX">Judg. 9:48</reflink>). Probably the southern peak of Gerizim, now called Jebel Sulman. (<see target="x-self">See SALMON.</see>)</description>

    <description>a race of giants; "a people great, and many, and tall, as the Anakims" (<reflink target="XXX">Deut. 2:20, 21</reflink>). They were overcome by the Ammonites, "who called them Zamzummims." They belonged to the Rephaim, and inhabited the country afterwards occupied by the Ammonites. It has been conjectured that they might be Ham-zuzims, i.e., Zuzims dwelling in Ham, a place apparently to the south of Ashteroth (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 14:5</reflink>), the ancient Rabbath-ammon.</description>

  <item id="Zanoah">
    <description>marsh. (1.) A town in the low country or shephelah of Judah, near Zorah (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 15:34</reflink>). It was re-occupied after the return from the Captivity (<reflink target="XXX">Neh. 11:30</reflink>). Zanu'ah in Wady Ismail, 10 miles west of Jerusalem, occupies probably the same site.</description>

  <item id="Zaphnath-paaneah">
    <description>the name which Pharaoh gave to Joseph when he raised him to the rank of prime minister or grand vizier of the kingdom (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 41:45</reflink>). This is a pure Egyptian word, and has been variously explained. Some think it means "creator," or "preserver of life." Brugsch interprets it as "governor of the district of the place of life", i.e., of Goshen, the chief city of which was Pithom, "the place of life." Others explain it as meaning "a revealer of secrets," or "the man to whom secrets are revealed."</description>

  <item id="Zarephath">
    <description>smelting-shop, "a workshop for the refining and smelting of metals", a small Phoenician town, now Surafend, about a mile from the coast, almost midway on the road between Tyre and Sidon. Here Elijah sojourned with a poor widow during the "great famine," when the "heaven was shut up three years and six months" (<reflink target="XXX">Luke 4:26; 1 Kings 17:10</reflink>).

  <item id="Zaretan">
    <description>When the Hebrews crossed the Jordan, as soon as the feet of the priests were dipped in the water, the flow of the stream was arrested. The point of arrest was the "city of Adam beside Zaretan," probably near Succoth, at the mouth of the Jabbok, some 30 miles up the river from where the people were encamped. There the water "stood and rose upon an heap." Thus the whole space of 30 miles of the river-bed was dry, that the tribes might pass over (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 3:16, 17; comp. Ps. 104:3</reflink>).</description>

"A few broken basaltic columns and pieces of wall about 200 yards back from the shore, and a ruined fort rather nearer the sea, about the middle of the coast line of the plain, are all that are left" (Tristram's Land of Moab).</description>

  <item id="Zealots">
    <description>a sect of Jews which originated with Judas the Gaulonite (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 5:37</reflink>). They refused to pay tribute to the Romans, on the ground that this was a violation of the principle that God was the only king of Israel. They rebelled against the Romans, but were soon scattered, and became a lawless band of mere brigands. They were afterwards called Sicarii, from their use of the sica, i.e., the Roman dagger.</description>

  <item id="Zebah">
    <description>man-killer, or sacrifice, one of the two kings who led the vast host of the Midianites who invaded the land of Israel, and over whom Gideon gained a great and decisive victory (Judg. 8). Zebah and Zalmunna had succeeded in escaping across the Jordan with a remnant of the Midianite host, but were overtaken at Karkor, probably in the Hauran, and routed by Gideon. The kings were taken alive and brought back across the Jordan; and confessing that they had personally taken part in the slaughter of Gideon's brothers, they were put to death (comp. 1 Sam. 12:11; Isa. 10:26; Ps. 83:11).</description>

It had a king of its own (Shemeber), and was therefore a place of some importance. It was destroyed along with the other cities of the plain.</description>
    <description>(2.) A valley or rugged glen somewhere near Gibeah in Benjamin (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 13:18</reflink>). It was probably the ravine now bearing the name Wady Shakh-ed-Dub'a, or "ravine of the hyena," north of Jericho.</description>

  <item id="Zebulun, Tribe of">
    <description>numbered at Sinai (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 1:31</reflink>) and before entering Canaan (26:27). It was one of the tribes which did not drive out the Canaanites, but only made them tributary (<reflink target="XXX">Judg. 1:30</reflink>). It took little interest in public affairs. It responded, however, readily to the summons of Gideon (6:35), and afterwards assisted in enthroning David at Hebron (<reflink target="XXX">1 Chr. 12:33, 40</reflink>). Along with the other northern tribes, Zebulun was carried away into the land of Assyria by Tiglath-pileser (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 15:29</reflink>).</description>
    <description>In Deborah's song the words, "Out of Zebulun they that handle the pen of the writer" (<reflink target="XXX">Judg. 5:14</reflink>) has been rendered in the R.V., "They that handle the marshal's staff." This is a questionable rendering. "The word _sopher_ ('scribe' or 'writer') defines the word _shebhet_ ('rod' or 'pen') with which it is conjoined. The 'rod of the scribe' on the Assyrian monuments was the stylus of wood or metal, with the help of which the clay tablet was engraved, or the papyrus inscribed with characters. The scribe who wielded it was the associate and assistant of the 'lawgivers.'" (Sayce).</description>

  <item id="Zechariah">
    <description>Jehovah is renowned or remembered. (1.) A prophet of Judah, the eleventh of the twelve minor prophets. Like Ezekiel, he was of priestly extraction. He describes himself (1:1) as "the son of Berechiah." In Ezra 5:1 and 6:14 he is called "the son of Iddo," who was properly his grandfather. His prophetical career began in the second year of Darius (B.C. 520), about sixteen years after the return of the first company from exile. He was contemporary with Haggai (<reflink target="XXX">Ezra 5:1</reflink>).</description>
    <description>His book consists of two distinct parts, (1) chapters 1 to 8, inclusive, and (2) 9 to the end. It begins with a preface (1:1-6), which recalls the nation's past history, for the purpose of presenting a solemn warning to the present generation. Then follows a series of eight visions (1:7-6:8), succeeding one another in one night, which may be regarded as a symbolical history of Israel, intended to furnish consolation to the returned exiles and stir up hope in their minds. The symbolical action, the crowning of Joshua (6:9-15), describes how the kingdoms of the world become the kingdom of God's Christ.</description>
    <description>Chapters 7 and 8, delivered two years later, are an answer to the question whether the days of mourning for the destruction of the city should be any longer kept, and an encouraging address to the people, assuring them of God's presence and blessing.</description>
    <description>The second part of the book (ch. 9-14) bears no date. It is probable that a considerable interval separates it from the first part. It consists of two burdens.</description>
    <description>The first burden (ch. 9-11) gives an outline of the course of God's providential dealings with his people down to the time of the Advent.</description>
    <description>The second burden (ch. 12-14) points out the glories that await Israel in "the latter day", the final conflict and triumph of God's kingdom.</description>
    <description>(2.) The son or grandson of Jehoiada, the high priest in the times of Ahaziah and Joash. After the death of Jehoiada he boldly condemned both the king and the people for their rebellion against God (<reflink target="XXX">2 Chr. 24:20</reflink>), which so stirred up their resentment against him that at the king's commandment they stoned him with stones, and he died "in the court of the house of the Lord" (24:21). Christ alludes to this deed of murder in Matt. 23:35, Luke 11:51. (<see target="x-self">See ZACHARIAS [2].</see>)</description>
    <description>(3.) A prophet, who had "understanding in the seeing of God," in the time of Uzziah, who was much indebted to him for his wise counsel (<reflink target="XXX">2 Chr. 26:5</reflink>).</description>

  <item id="Zedekiah">
    <description>righteousness of Jehovah. (1.) The last king of Judah. He was the third son of Josiah, and his mother's name was Hamutal, the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah, and hence he was the brother of Jehoahaz (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 23:31; 24:17, 18</reflink>). His original name was Mattaniah; but when Nebuchadnezzar placed him on the throne as the successor to Jehoiachin he changed his name to Zedekiah. The prophet Jeremiah was his counsellor, yet "he did evil in the sight of the Lord" (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 24:19, 20; Jer. 52:2, 3</reflink>). He ascended the throne at the age of twenty-one years. The kingdom was at that time tributary to Nebuchadnezzar; but, despite the strong remonstrances of Jeremiah and others, as well as the example of Jehoiachin, he threw off the yoke of Babylon, and entered into an alliance with Hophra, king of Egypt. This brought up Nebuchadnezzar, "with all his host" (<reflink target="XXX">2 King 25:1</reflink>), against Jerusalem. During this siege, which lasted about eighteen months, "every worst woe befell the devoted city, which drank the cup of God's fury to the dregs" (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 25:3; Lam. 4:4, 5, 10</reflink>). The city was plundered and laid in ruins. Zedekiah and his followers, attempting to escape, were made captive and taken to Riblah. There, after seeing his own children put to death, his own eyes were put out, and, being loaded with chains, he was carried captive (B.C. 588) to Babylon (<reflink target="XXX">2 Kings 25:1-7; 2 Chr. 36:12; Jer. 32:4,5; 34:2, 3; 39:1-7; 52:4-11; Ezek. 12:12</reflink>), where he remained a prisoner, how long is unknown, to the day of his death.</description>
    <description>After the fall of Jerusalem, Nebuzaraddan was sent to carry out its complete destruction. The city was razed to the ground. Only a small number of vinedressers and husbandmen were permitted to remain in the land (<reflink target="XXX">Jer. 52:16</reflink>).

But that the possession of Zelophehad might not pass away in the year of jubilee from the tribe to which he belonged, it was ordained by Moses that his daughters should not marry any one out of their father's tribe; and this afterwards became a general law (Num. 36).</description>

    <description>Jehovah has concealed, or Jehovah of darkness. (1.) The son of Cushi, and great-grandson of Hezekiah, and the ninth in the order of the minor prophets. He prophesied in the days of Josiah, king of Judah (B.C. 641-610), and was contemporary with Jeremiah, with whom he had much in common. The book of his prophecies consists of:</description>
    <description>(a) An introduction (1:1-6), announcing the judgment of the world, and the judgment upon Israel, because of their transgressions.</description>
    <description>(b) The description of the judgment (1:7-18).</description>

With an enormous army, the largest we read of in Scripture, he invaded the kingdom of Judah in the days of Asa (<reflink target="XXX">2 Chr. 14:9-15</reflink>). He reached Zephathah, and there encountered the army of Asa. This is the only instance "in all the annals of Judah of a victorious encounter in the field with a first-class heathen power in full force." The Egyptian host was utterly routed, and the Hebrews gathered "exceeding much spoil." Three hundred years elapsed before another Egyptian army, that of Necho (B.C. 609), came up against Jerusalem.</description>

In the first year of Cyrus, king of Persia, he led the first band of Jews, numbering 42,360 (<reflink target="XXX">Ezra 2:64</reflink>), exclusive of a large number of servants, who returned from captivity at the close of the seventy years. In the second year after the Return, he erected an altar and laid the foundation of the temple on the ruins of that which had been destroyed by Nebuchadnezzar (3:8-13; ch. 4-6).

    <description>a fishery, a town on the Mediterranean coast, about 25 miles north of Tyre. It received its name from the "first-born" of Canaan, the grandson of Noah (<reflink target="XXX">Gen. 10:15, 19</reflink>). It was the first home of the Phoenicians on the coast of Palestine, and from its extensive commercial relations became a "great" city (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 11:8; 19:28</reflink>). It was the mother city of Tyre. It lay within the lot of the tribe of Asher, but was never subdued (<reflink target="XXX">Judg. 1:31</reflink>). The Zidonians long oppressed Israel (<reflink target="XXX">Judg. 10:12</reflink>). From the time of David its glory began to wane, and Tyre, its "virgin daughter" (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 23:12</reflink>), rose to its place of pre-eminence. Solomon entered into a matrimonial alliance with the Zidonians, and thus their form of idolatrous worship found a place in the land of Israel (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 11:1, 33</reflink>). This city was famous for its manufactures and arts, as well as for its commerce (<reflink target="XXX">1 Kings 5:6; 1 Chr. 22:4; Ezek. 27:8</reflink>). It is frequently referred to by the prophets (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 23:2, 4, 12; Jer. 25:22; 27:3; 47:4; Ezek. 27:8; 28:21, 22; 32:30; Joel 3:4</reflink>). Our Lord visited the "coasts" of Tyre and Zidon = Sidon (q.v.), Matt. 15:21; Mark 7:24; Luke 4:26; and from this region many came forth to hear him preaching (<reflink target="XXX">Mark 3:8; Luke 6:17</reflink>). From Sidon, at which the ship put in after leaving Caesarea, Paul finally sailed for Rome (<reflink target="XXX">Acts 27:3, 4</reflink>).</description>
    <description>This city is now a town of 10,000 inhabitants, with remains of walls built in the twelfth century A.D. In 1855, the sarcophagus of Eshmanezer was discovered. From a Phoenician inscription on its lid, it appears that he was a "king of the Sidonians," probably in the third century B.C., and that his mother was a priestess of Ashtoreth, "the goddess of the Sidonians." In this inscription Baal is mentioned as the chief god of the Sidonians.</description>

    <description>a town in the Negeb, or south country of Judah (<reflink target="XXX">Josh. 15:31</reflink>), in the possession of the Philistines when David fled to Gath from Ziph with all his followers. Achish, the king, assigned him Ziklag as his place of residence. There he dwelt for over a year and four months. From this time it pertained to the kings of Judah (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 27:6</reflink>). During his absence with his army to join the Philistine expedition against the Israelites (29:11), it was destroyed by the Amalekites (30:1, 2), whom David, however, pursued and utterly routed, returning all the captives (<reflink target="XXX">1 Sam. 30:26-31</reflink>). Two days after his return from this expedition, David received tidings of the disastrous battle of Gilboa and of the death of Saul (<reflink target="XXX">2 Sam. 1:1-16</reflink>). He now left Ziklag and returned to Hebron, along with his two wives, Ahinoam and Abigail, and his band of 600 men. It has been identified with 'Asluj, a heap of ruins south of Beersheba. Conder, however, identifies it with Khirbet Zuheilikah, ruins found on three hills half a mile apart, some seventeen miles north-west of Beersheba, on the confines of Philistia, Judah, and Amalek.</description>

  <item id="Zoan">
    <description>(Old Egypt. Sant= "stronghold," the modern San). A city on the Tanitic branch of the Nile, called by the Greeks Tanis. It was built seven years after Hebron in Palestine (<reflink target="XXX">Num. 13:22</reflink>). This great and important city was the capital of the Hyksos, or Shepherd kings, who ruled Egypt for more than 500 years. It was the frontier town of Goshen. Here Pharaoh was holding his court at the time of his various interviews with Moses and Aaron. "No trace of Zoan exists; Tanis was built over it, and city after city has been built over the ruins of that" (Harper, Bible and Modern Discovery). Extensive mounds of ruins, the wreck of the ancient city, now mark its site (<reflink target="XXX">Isa. 19:11, 13; 30:4; Ezek. 30:14</reflink>). "The whole constitutes one of the grandest and oldest ruins in the world."</description>
    <description>This city was also called "the Field of Zoan" (<reflink target="XXX">Ps. 78:12, 43</reflink>) and "the Town of Rameses" (q.v.), because the oppressor rebuilt and embellished it, probably by the forced labour of the Hebrews, and made it his northern capital.</description>

Its ruins are still seen at the opening of the ravine of Kerak, the Kir-Moab referred to in 2 Kings 3, the modern Tell esh-Shaghur.</description>
